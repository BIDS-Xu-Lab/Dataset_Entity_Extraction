### INPUT:
A 77-year-old male with history of hypertension and asthma presented with 3 months of progressive decline in vision in the left eye. He had no known ocular history. At presentation, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/100 OD and 20/50 OS. Intraocular pressures were normal bilaterally and pupils were equally reactive. Examination of the right eye was unremarkable except for moderate cataract. The left-eye slitlamp examination was remarkable for a shallow but quiet anterior chamber and moderate cataract. Dilated fundus examination of the left eye revealed shallow peripheral serous choroidal detachments, bullous inferior macula-involving retinal detachment with shifting fluid, and diffuse hyperpigmented lesions involving the macula and superior fundus that corresponded to areas of nodular retinal pigment epithelium thickening on optical coherence tomography (Figure 1). These hyperpigmented lesions were associated with hyperautofluorescence and blockage on fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography. No retinal breaks were seen on scleral depressed examination. Ultrasound biomicroscopy demonstrated 360° ciliochoroidal effusion. Axial length was 24.30 mm OD and 24.32 mm OS. The patient denied a history of known refractive error.

5. Posterior Scleritis
6. Choroidal Melanoma
7. Retinal Vein Occlusion
8. Hypertensive Retinopathy
9. Diabetic Retinopathy
10. Idiopathic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis List:
After considering all the patient information and test results such as the absence of known ocular history, the presence of shallow peripheral serous choroidal detachments, bullous retinal detachment with shifting fluid, hyperpigmented lesions, hyperautofluorescence, and ciliochoroidal effusion, here's the reranked list:

1. Uveal Effusion Syndrome
2. Posterior Scleritis
3. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease
4. Central Serous Chorioretinopathy
5. Choroidal Melanoma
6. Age-Related Macular Degeneration
7. Hypertensive Retinopathy
8. Retinal Vein Occlusion
9. Diabetic Retinopathy
10. Idiopathic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy

#### Supporting Rationalization:
**1. Uveal Effusion Syndrome** emerges as the top differential due to the characteristic ciliochoroidal effusion, shallow anterior chamber, and serous detachments without a history of glaucoma or other precipitating factors.

**2. Posterior Scleritis** is considered next due to its association with ciliochoroidal effusions and retinal detachments but typically would be associated with more pain and signs of inflammation which this patient lacks prominently.

**3. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease** can present with serous retinal detachment and RPE changes, although typically associated with more systemic symptoms.

**4. Central Serous Chorioretinopathy** fits some features but usually does not present with such extensive detachments or nodular thickening of the RPE.

**5. Choroidal Melanoma** should be considered due to the fundus findings and potential to cause secondary detachments, even though systemic signs are absent.

**6. Age-Related Macular Degeneration** and **7. Hypertensive Retinopathy** are more common for the age group but less likely given the specific ocular findings.

**8. Retinal Vein Occlusion** and **9. Diabetic Retinopathy** include secondary retinal detachment but the history and clinical findings are not supportive of these diagnoses.

**10. Idiopathic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy** is a standalone consideration but less likely with the total profile of observations noted.","['Retinal Disorders', 'Ophthalmic Imaging', 'Ophthalmology', 'Macular Diseases']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,77.0,M

### INPUT:
A 23-year-old male patient sought evaluation at the vascular thyroid surgery clinic for a large neck tumor that appeared abruptly 10 days prior. The patient reported experiencing tightness and discomfort in the left side of the neck but denied experiencing any pain. He denied any recent incidents of neck trauma or impact. Furthermore, his medical history did not reveal any previous hematological disorders. The ultrasonography examination detected the presence of a well-defined, solid mass located in the left lobe of the thyroid gland. The mass exhibited regular shape, distinct boundaries, heterogeneous echogenicity, and observable blood flow signals. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck detected heterogeneous density mass shadows within the soft tissue region near the left lobe of the thyroid, exhibiting distinct boundaries measuring 53 × 41 × 88 mm. Subsequent enhanced CT did not reveal notable enhancement of the cystic components of the mass (Figure 1). Due to persistent symptoms, the patient expressed a desire for surgical resection. Consequently, the patient underwent open surgery to remove the mass, aiming to establish a definitive diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Vagal schwannoma,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Thyroid Adenoma**:
   A benign tumor of the thyroid gland that may present as a well-defined, non-tender mass. 

2. **Thyroid Carcinoma**:
   Malignant tumor of the thyroid that can present as a solid mass with distinct boundaries and heterogeneous echogenicity.

3. **Thyroid Cyst**:
   A fluid-filled sac within the thyroid that might not exhibit notable enhancement on CT imaging.

4. **Multinodular Goiter**:
   An enlarged thyroid with multiple nodules that might have various echogenicities and well-defined boundaries.

5. **Parathyroid Adenoma**:
   A benign tumor in the parathyroid gland that can present as a mass near the thyroid.

6. **Lymphoma**:
   A type of cancer that can appear as a solid mass in the neck, with possible extension to the thyroid.

7. **Metastatic Lymph Node**:
   A secondary malignant tumor that has spread to a lymph node near the thyroid, presenting as a well-defined mass.

8. **Thyroid Abscess**:
   A purulent infection that can form a localized mass in or near the thyroid gland, often with well-defined boundaries.

9. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**:
   Congenital lesion that can present as a cystic mass in the neck region with distinct boundaries.

10. **Castleman Disease**:
    A rare disorder that can cause lymph node hyperplasia and appear as a solid mass in the neck.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on Full Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Thyroid Carcinoma**:
   The presence of a solid mass with heterogeneous echogenicity, distinct boundaries, and observable blood flow suggests a high probability of malignancy.

2. **Thyroid Adenoma**:
   The well-defined, solid nature of the mass and lack of pain could point towards a benign adenoma, though less likely due to mass size and rapid onset.

3. **Metastatic Lymph Node**:
   Considered due to the solid nature and size of the mass, albeit the lack of primary cancer history reduces its likelihood.

4. **Lymphoma**:
   Still possible given the presentation, but less likely due to the typically more diffuse spread.

5. **Parathyroid Adenoma**:
   Possible but lower in likelihood since the mass is in the thyroid and not exhibiting typical parathyroid adenoma characteristics.

6. **Multinodular Goiter**:
   Less likely due to the solitary and distinct nature of the mass.

7. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**:
   Unlikely due to the solid nature of the mass and patient age, though still a differential.

8. **Thyroid Abscess**:
   Unlikely due to the lack of inflammatory signs and symptoms.

9. **Castleman Disease**:
   Rare, but considered due to the presence of a solid mass with distinct boundaries.

10. **Thyroid Cyst**:
    The lack of enhancement and cystic components suggests this is less likely than a solid mass etiology.

### INPUT:
A male patient was evaluated by the dermatology inpatient consult service. He reported a 5-week history of a skin lesion on the right anterior thigh with intermittent itching and mild tenderness to palpation. There was no preceding trauma to the area. The lesion was stable in size. He denied systemic symptoms of fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and dyspnea on exertion. He was unhoused and sleeping on the streets with his dog prior to hospitalization. Physical examination was remarkable for a 5-cm erythematous plaque studded with papules and pustules (Figure 1A). No pus or granules could be expressed with pressure. The patient had no similar skin lesions elsewhere on the body. A 6-mm punch biopsy was obtained from the lesion. One half was sent for routine histopathology with special stains, and the other half was submitted for bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial culture (Figure 1B).

9. **Ecthyma Gangrenosum**
10. **Cutaneous Anthrax**

### Re-ranking Based on Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Cutaneous Leishmaniasis**: The patient's history of being unhoused and potentially exposed to vector-borne diseases, coupled with a stable, erythematous plaque and confirmed pathology, aligns well with this diagnosis.
2. **Sporotrichosis**: Given the exposure to soil and animals, the lesion's appearance, and the history provided, this is a strong differential.
3. **Cutaneous Tuberculosis**: Although less common, the lesion's characteristics and the patient's living conditions could point towards this diagnosis.
4. **Blastomycosis**: Possible due to its manifestation as a skin lesion and geographic correlation.
5. **Nocardiosis**: Given the immunosuppressive potential of the patient’s unhoused status and environmental exposure.
6. **Ecthyma Gangrenosum**: The lesion morphology and the patient’s background could suggest this, although it typically appears in immunocompromised patients.
7. **Cutaneous Anthrax**: Though less likely, this should be considered due to the characteristic plaques and history of possible animal contact.
8. **Cellulitis**: Common but does not fit perfectly with the described chronicity and morphology.
9. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**: Typically presents more aggressively and diffusely than as a single stable plaque.
10. **Tinea Corporis (Ringworm)**: Considered but less likely given the described lesion morphology and chronicity.

### INPUT:
A 74-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, now in remission, presented for evaluation of a conjunctival lesion of the right eye. Per her history, the lesion was noted over 18 years in the past by her optometrist. She reported no noticeable growth or changes to the lesion but was sent for evaluation with ocular oncology. Visual acuity with correction was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 14 mm Hg in the right eye and 16 mm Hg in the left eye. Anterior segment examination results were within normal limits for the left eye, and dilated fundus examination results for both eyes did not reveal concerning pathology. The conjunctiva of the right eye was notable for a small elevated pigmented lesion measuring approximately 2 × 2 mm with sentinel vessels (Figure 1A). Fundus photographs and autofluorescence (Figure 1B) as well as optical coherence tomography (OCT) were normal bilaterally. An anterior-segment OCT was performed and revealed a small elevated subepithelial lesion with shadowing vs possible scleral extension (Figure 1B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Ciliary body melanoma with extrascleral extension masquerading as a conjunctival nevus,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis
1. **Conjunctival Melanoma:** Given the pigmented nature of the lesion and associated sentinel vessels, conjunctival melanoma must be considered first, especially with shadowing on OCT suggesting possible scleral invasion.
   
2. **Nevus**: A longstanding, unchanged conjunctival lesion is most likely a benign nevus, even though it necessitates careful evaluation to rule out malignant changes.

3. **Primary Acquired Melanosis (PAM):** This condition can present as a pigmented conjunctival lesion, though it typically exhibits more diffuse pigmentation rather than a discrete lesion.

4. **Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia (OSSN):** While typically non-pigmented, pigmented variants exist, and the presentation can occasionally mimic pigmented lesions.

5. **Conjunctival Epithelial Inclusion Cyst:** A rare diagnosis, but small elevated lesions like this can also represent benign inclusion cysts, though they usually do not present with pigmentation.

6. **Conjunctival Kaposi’s Sarcoma:** More common in immunocompromised individuals and may present as a pigmented conjunctival lesion, it's considered in differential primarily because of the patient's age.

7. **Conjunctival Foreign Body:** A long-standing history with no observable growth could imply a foreign body encapsulated by conjunctival tissue; however, this is rare for such a pigmented presentation.

8. **Conjunctival Hemangioma:** Generally non-pigmented but vascular lesions, these can sometimes present with varied appearances and be confused with pigmented lesions.

9. **Pyogenic Granuloma:** A benign growth that is vascular and can sometimes become pigmented after repeated inflammation or trauma to the conjunctiva.

10. **Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Conjunctiva:** Although extremely rare, pigmented variants do exist, and the patient’s history of cancer could suggest a potential for secondary malignancies.

### Refined Differential Diagnosis with Patient Information and Test Results
Now, let's re-evaluate and rank the differential diagnoses, considering the detailed patient history, examination, and test results given, in order of most to least likely.

1. **Conjunctival Nevus:** Given the long history (18 years) without notable changes, a benign nevus becomes the most likely diagnosis.
   
2. **Conjunctival Melanoma:** Despite the long history, the presence of sentinel vessels and possible scleral extension seen on OCT, the risk of malignancy cannot be completely ruled out without biopsy.
   
3. **Primary Acquired Melanosis (PAM):** Less likely due to the discrete, longstanding nature of the lesion, but still within the realm of possibility.
   
4. **Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia (OSSN):** Although typically non-pigmented, the possibility of a pigmented variant warrants consideration given the lesion’s appearance.

5. **Conjunctival Kaposi’s Sarcoma:** Less likely without a history of immunocompromise and given the long, stable presentation.
   
6. **Conjunctival Epithelial Inclusion Cyst:** Rare and typically non-pigmented, making it a less likely diagnosis but still possible given the elevation noted.
   
7. **Conjunctival Hemangioma:** Typically more vascular appearing and non-pigmented, making it unlikely.

8. **Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Conjunctiva:** Uncommon and usually non-pigmented; still, patient history of previous malignancy warrants its rare consideration.
   
9. **Conjunctival Foreign Body:** Highly unlikely given the pigmented and vascular nature of the lesion.

10. **Pyogenic Granuloma:** Usually appears as a pink-red, raised lesion rather than pigmented, making it the least likely diagnosis in this case.","['External Eye Disease', 'Ophthalmology', 'Breast Cancer', ""Women's Health"", 'Oncology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,74.0,F

### INPUT:
A 52-year-old woman presented with decreased vision in both eyes. She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 3 months before presentation, with a hemoglobin A1c of 13%. At that time, she was given metformin and semaglutide for glucose control. Her visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/200 OS. Fundus examination revealed retinal hemorrhages, hard exudates, and microaneurysms bilaterally (Figure, A and B). Fluorescein angiography revealed microaneurysms with noncentral leakage in the posterior pole with absence of significant ischemia and capillary dropout. Optical coherence tomography scans from the same day showed retinal edema with intraretinal fluid accumulation in both eyes (central subfield thickness: 320 nm OD, 764 nm OS) with foveal detachment in the left eye. She was diagnosed with severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy with macular edema in both eyes. She received 2 and 3 injections of bevacizumab in the right and left eyes, respectively, followed by 2 injections of aflibercept in both eyes with minimal effect on the edema. Blood analysis showed the following values: hemoglobin, 10.4 g/dL; red blood cell count, 3.30 × 106/μL; white blood cell count, 10 470/μL; platelets, 197 × 103/μL; fasting blood glucose, 150 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555); normal lipid profile; and creatinine, 1.2 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4). Hemoglobin A1c decreased to 6.8% at 7 months after presentation. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Immunoglobulin (Ig) A multiple myeloma with paraproteinemic maculopathy,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Diabetic Retinopathy**: Given the known history of type 2 diabetes and the clinical findings of retinal hemorrhages, hard exudates, and microaneurysms, diabetic retinopathy is the primary differential diagnosis.
2. **Hypertensive Retinopathy**: A common cause of retinal changes (hemorrhages and exudates) that needs to be considered, especially in older adults with comorbid conditions like diabetes.
3. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)**: Presents with sudden vision loss and retinal hemorrhages; requires differentiation from diabetic retinopathy.
4. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**: Can cause vision loss and exudative changes but typically lacks the extensive microaneurysms and hemorrhages seen in diabetic retinopathy.
5. **Retinal Vasculitis**: Inflammation of retinal vessels leading to hemorrhage, exudates, and edema.
6. **Retinal Detachment**: Particularly relevant given the presence of retinal edema and foveal detachment.
7. **Anemia-Related Retinopathy**: Considering the hemoglobin value of 10.4 g/dL, which could affect retinal circulation and cause hemorrhages.
8. **Infectious Retinitis**: For example, CMV retinitis in immunocompromised patients, though less likely here given the patient’s immune status.
9. **Drug Toxicity**: Some medications can cause retinal changes as side effects.
10. **Uveitis**: Inflammation of the uveal tract, presenting similarly with macular edema and retinal changes.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Diabetic Retinopathy**: Given the patient's recent diagnosis of type 2 diabetes with high HbA1c, characteristic fundus findings, and presence of macular edema, diabetic retinopathy remains the most likely diagnosis.
2. **Hypertensive Retinopathy**: Less likely given the absence of a history of hypertension on initial presentation, but still a consideration.
3. **Retinal Detachment**: Due to the presence of foveal detachment seen on OCT.
4. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)**: Possible given retinal hemorrhages but less likely than diabetic retinopathy.
5. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**: The presence of retinal hemorrhages and edema makes AMD a less likely primary diagnosis compared to diabetic retinopathy.
6. **Anemia-Related Retinopathy**: Given the mild anemia, it’s a lower probability but possible contributing factor.
7. **Retinal Vasculitis**: Less likely without signs of systemic inflammatory disease.
8. **Uveitis**: Unlikely without signs or symptoms of intraocular inflammation.
9. **Infectious Retinitis**: Very unlikely in an immunocompetent patient without systemic signs of infection.
10. **Drug Toxicity**: Unlikely given the medications involved (metformin and semaglutide) typically do not cause such retinal findings.

By considering the patient's clinical presentation, medical history, and the results of diagnostic tests, the most probable diagnosis is diabetic retinopathy. Other differentials are considered less likely but included for completeness in the differential diagnosis process.","['Hematology', 'Myeloma', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Macular Diseases']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,52.0,F

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old woman presented for evaluation of bilateral blurry vision over the past month. She experienced fulminant hepatic failure 3 months ago and underwent a liver transplant 2 weeks later. Postoperative pathological results showed hepatolenticular degeneration. Routine prophylactic antiherpes virus therapy had been applied for 2 weeks. Immunosuppressants, including tacrolimus and mycophenolate sodium, were applied for subsequent maintenance therapy. She noticed the onset of decreased vision in both eyes about 2 months after the liver transplant. Diagnosed with ocular herpes virus infection, she was given systemic valaciclovir and ocular laser retinopexy around areas of necrosis. Her vision was not improved and twice intravitreous injection of ganciclovir was added. However, vision was decreasing continuously. At her presentation to our clinic, the best-corrected visual acuity was finger count in the right eye and 20/125 in the left eye. On slitlamp examination of both eyes, 1+ aqueous cells and 1+ flare were presented in the anterior chamber, while the dilated fundus examination showed mild inflammation in the vitreous. Extensive patches of yellowish necrotic lesions were seen at the peripheral retina of the right eye and 1 triangular necrotic lesion in the posterior pole (Figure 1A). A large annular necrosis was found in the peripheral retina of the left eye (Figure 1B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Toxoplasma retinochoroiditis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis**: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and the appearance of retinal necrosis, cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis is a significant suspect.
   
2. **Progressive Outer Retinal Necrosis (PORN)**: A condition seen primarily in immunocompromised individuals, such as those on immunosuppressive therapy, presenting with retinal necrosis.

3. **Acute Retinal Necrosis (ARN)**: This syndrome can present with peripheral necrotic retinal lesions and might be considered given her ocular herpes diagnosis.

4. **Choroiditis**: This often presents as white or yellow lesions on the retina and could cause decreased vision.

5. **Toxoplasmosis Retinochoroiditis**: Commonly presents with retinal lesions, especially in immunocompromised patients.

6. **Syphilitic Uveitis**: Can cause posterior segment inflammation and retinal necrosis.

7. **Drug-Induced Retinopathy**: Tacrolimus and mycophenolate sodium can have side effects that affect vision.

8. **Bartonella Retinitis**: Seen in immunosuppressed patients and can cause retinal lesions.

9. **Tuberculous Chorioretinitis**: This tuberculosis-related condition can lead to retinal involvement.

10. **Lymphoma**: Ocular involvement in systemic lymphoma can present with retinal lesions and is a differential to consider in immunocompromised patients.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Information:

1. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis**: High likelihood due to classic presentation of retinitis in immunocompromised patients.
   
2. **Progressive Outer Retinal Necrosis (PORN)**: Patients on prolonged immunosuppressants are at increased risk, fitting the clinical picture.

3. **Acute Retinal Necrosis (ARN)**: Given the history of herpes, ARN should be considered seriously, despite ongoing treatment.

4. **Syphilitic Uveitis**: Should be high on the list given the severity of presentation and prevalence in immunocompromised states; serologic testing could determine this.

5. **Toxoplasmosis Retinochoroiditis**: Commonly linked with peripheral retinal lesions, particularly in immunocompromised patients.

6. **Choroiditis**: Although it often presents with different symptoms, it remains a differential to consider.

7. **Drug-Induced Retinopathy**: The patient's medications may contribute some degree of retinal damage, though less likely the primary cause now.

8. **Bartonella Retinitis**: Possible but typically less common than CMV or PORN in this context.

9. **Tuberculous Chorioretinitis**: Requires TB exposure history, which hasn't been detailed, making it less likely here.

A 69-year-old man presented to the rheumatology clinic 3 weeks after being hospitalized for fever, fatigue, rash, right periorbital swelling, and shortness of breath. This was his fifth inpatient stay in the past 3 years for similar symptoms. During a recent hospitalization, he had purpuric macules and plaques on his lower extremities bilaterally (Figure, left panel). Laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 2.9 × 103/μL (reference, 4.2-10.8 ×103/μL); mean corpuscular volume, 96.1 fL (reference, 80-96 fL); hemoglobin level, 12.4 mg/dL (reference, 14.0-18.0 mg/dL); and a normal platelet count. C-reactive protein level was 270 mg/L (reference, 0-5 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 98 mm/h (reference, 0-20 mm/h).Results of testing for antinuclear antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies were negative. Computed tomography of the chest revealed numerous small, bilateral pulmonary nodules (Figure, right panel). Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed bilateral inferior rectus muscle enlargement with mild inflammatory changes along the extraocular muscles and optic nerves. A skin biopsy showed a perivascular neutrophilic infiltrate consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis. During his most recent hospitalization, he was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone (40 mg twice daily) for 5 days and discharged taking oral prednisone (40 mg daily) for 4 weeks. Previously, he had pericardial and pleural effusions and pulmonary infiltrates. Pericardial biopsy showed organizing pericarditis and lung biopsy revealed cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, with negative IgG4 stains. Results of bone marrow biopsy, including flow cytometry and cytogenetic testing, performed 18 months prior to the current presentation were normal.

    ","VEXAS (vacuoles, E1-ubiquitin-activating enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome","Sure, let's approach the differential diagnosis step-by-step based on the provided information.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **IgG4-Related Disease**: Despite negative IgG4 stains, the patient’s recurrent pericarditis, periorbital swelling, and pulmonary infiltrates may initially suggest this possibility.
   
2. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)**: Negative ANCA doesn’t rule out GPA; the clinical picture of pulmonary nodules and other symptoms fits well.

3. **Churg-Strauss Syndrome (Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**: Though eosinophilia wasn’t noted, other features like pulmonary involvement and vasculitis could suggest this.

4. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: ANA-negative lupus can occur; recurrent pericarditis, rash, and systemic symptoms are consistent with lupus.

5. **Behçet's Disease**: This disease might present with recurrent oral/genital ulcers, vasculitis, and systemic symptoms.

6. **Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN)**: Considered for systemic vasculitis affecting multiple organs without specific serological markers.

7. **Cryoglobulinemic Vasculitis**: Associated with various systemic symptoms, though it often involves positive cryoglobulin levels.

8. **Infective Endocarditis**: Recurrent systemic inflammation, though previous descriptions of pericarditis and specific valvular findings are absent, it remains a consideration.

9. **Adult-onset Still's Disease**: Characterized by fevers, rash, and arthritis; it can present variably with systemic inflammation markers elevated.

10. **Sarcoidosis**: Although less likely due to biopsy results, systemic granulomatous disease with pulmonary and possibly ocular involvement should be considered.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Data:

1. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)**: Fits very well with pulmonary nodules, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and systemic symptoms.
  
2. **Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN)**: Recurrent systemic vasculitis manifestation without specific serological markers matches clinical presentation.
  
3. **IgG4-Related Disease**: Despite negative IgG4 stains, the constellation of symptoms and lack of other definitive findings makes it plausible.
  
4. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: One cannot totally rule out ANA-negative lupus especially with significant systemic disease.
  
5. **Churg-Strauss Syndrome (EGPA)**: Absence of eosinophilia makes it less likely than GPA but should still be considered.
  
6. **Behçet's Disease**: Less suggestive without mucocutaneous involvement, but recurrent systemic inflammation fits.
  
7. **Cryoglobulinemic Vasculitis**: Considered less likely without supporting laboratory evidence.
  
8. **Adult-onset Still's Disease**: Clinical features are compatible, albeit non-specific for this diagnosis.
  
9. **Sarcoidosis**: Lower likelihood given lung biopsy results and lack of granulomas noted systemically.
  
10. **Infective Endocarditis**: Without new valvular findings or signs of direct cardiac infection, this drops in priority.

Inspection of the right lower eyelid revealed a cystic-appearing nodule that transilluminated and had a few overlying telangiectasias. The cystic portion was continuous with a deeper, smooth subcutaneous component that was well defined, firm, and nonmobile, with a total lesion length of 1 cm (Figure 1A). There was no madarosis, eyelid margin effacement or preauricular lymphadenopathy. Although no overt features of malignancy were present, the deeper component was atypical for a hidrocystoma and an excisional biopsy was performed. Histopathologic evaluation showed a neoplasm composed of low-grade round nuclei growing in a micropapillary pattern within pools of extracellular mucin (Figure 1B). There was tumor present at the margin. Immunostains were positive for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor. Variable staining for INSM1, a sensitive nuclear stain for neuroendocrine differentiation, and focal staining for synaptophysin, another neuroendocrine marker, were also seen. This immunophenotype is consistent with a primary tumor derived from endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carcinoma or a metastatic mucinous carcinoma of breast origin. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Mucinous carcinoma of the eyelid,"### Developing the Differential Diagnosis

#### Step 1: Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)
Given the patient's age and lesion characteristics, BCC is a common skin cancer that could present as a slow-growing nodule with telangiectasias.

#### Step 2: Sebaceous Carcinoma
Due to the eyelid location, sebaceous carcinoma is a possibility, characterized by non-tender nodules on the eyelid.

#### Step 3: Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)
A firm, non-mobile nodule could also indicate SCC, especially given the patient's history as a former smoker.

#### Step 4: Hidrocystoma
Benign cystic lesions such as hidrocystomas should be considered, typically presenting as non-mobile cystic nodules.

#### Step 5: Merkel Cell Carcinoma
A neuroendocrine tumor that could manifest on the eyelid, often evidenced by positive staining for neuroendocrine markers like synaptophysin.

#### Step 6: Metastatic Breast Carcinoma
Positive immunostains for estrogen and progesterone receptors could suggest a metastatic tumor from breast carcinoma, particularly with neuroendocrine features.

#### Step 7: Endocrine Mucin-Producing Sweat Gland Carcinoma
A rare carcinoma originating from the sweat glands, indicated by mucin production and neuroendocrine differentiation.

#### Step 8: Apocrine Hidrocystoma
An alternative benign cystic nodule that could present similarly, typically translucent and benign.

#### Step 9: Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma
A carcinoma characterized by mucinous and epidermoid cells, presenting as a firm nodule.

#### Step 10: Lymphoma
Though less likely given cytological features, a lymphoma could present as a firm, non-mobile lesion.

### Reevaluating and Reranking the Differential Diagnoses
Using all available patient information and test results, the differential diagnoses should be reranked, emphasizing positive immunostains and histopathologic features.

1. **Endocrine Mucin-Producing Sweat Gland Carcinoma**: Given the positive immunostains and specific histopathologic features.
2. **Metastatic Mucinous Carcinoma of Breast Origin**: Supported by estrogen and progesterone receptor positivity.
3. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma**: Indicated by neuroendocrine markers although less common.
4. **Sebaceous Carcinoma**: Considered due to the eyelid's locality but less supportive evidence from immunostains.
5. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**: A common eyelid tumor though histopathology does not align perfectly.
6. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**: Common in older patients but lacks supporting histological and immunostain evidence.
7. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma**: Histopathologic features do not match closely.
8. **Hidrocystoma**: Initially considered based on appearance, ruled out by deeper component traits and biopsy.
9. **Apocrine Hidrocystoma**: Also ruled out by deeper component and biopsy.
10. **Lymphoma**: Unlikely given the evidence from biopsy results.

By utilizing all the information, focusing particularly on histopathological and immunohistochemical results, the most probable diagnosis is a **primary endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carcinoma**.","['Dermatology', 'External Eye Disease', 'Facial Plastic Surgery', 'Oculoplastic Surgery', 'Oncology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,62.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his 40s presented with a 10-year history of pruritic lesions on the scrotum and buttock. He was diagnosed with eczema and treated at the local clinic with little improvement. He had no relevant medical history and no family history of similar skin problems. Physical examination revealed scattered, well-defined, annular gray hyperkeratotic plaques with an atrophic center and a slightly elevated edge on the scrotum, buttock, groin, and intergluteal cleft (Figure 1A). There was no inguinal adenopathy, and results of routine blood work, including blood biochemistry, syphilis serologies, and HIV testing, were normal or negative. We took 2 specimens from the scrotum and buttock, respectively, for histopathological examination (Figure 1B).

7. **Intertrigo**  
8. **Granuloma Annulare**  
9. **Paget's Disease of the Scrotum**  
10. **Lichen Simplex Chronicus**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on Comprehensive Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Psoriasis**  
   - Chronic condition with well-defined plaques, often resistant to typical eczema treatments.

2. **Lichen Planus**  
   - Characteristic annular plaques with atrophic centers, common in middle-aged individuals.

3. **Tinea Cruris (Jock Itch)**  
   - Common fungal infection in groin area, often pruritic; however, negative histopathology for fungal elements would lower suspicion.

4. **Bowen's Disease (Squamous Cell Carcinoma in situ)**  
   - Chronic, well-defined plaques and longstanding history may raise suspicion, particularly if atypical cells seen on histopathology.

5. **Granuloma Annulare**  
   - Annular plaques could be suggestive, yet less likely due to the chronicity and typical localization.

6. **Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus**  
   - Plaques with an atrophic center can be seen in discoid lupus, though systemic features are absent.

7. **Seborrheic Dermatitis**  
   - Less likely due to lack of improvement with typical treatments, and specific plaque characteristics described.

8. **Paget's Disease of the Scrotum**  
   - Rare, but chronicity and location warrant consideration; histopathology would reveal Paget cells if present.

9. **Lichen Simplex Chronicus**  
   - Secondary condition caused by chronic scratching, likely less prominent due to histopathological findings not aligning thoroughly.

10. **Intertrigo**  
    - Typically associated with more inflammation and moisture rather than well-defined plaques.

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old man presented to our clinic with a sudden decrease in vision in the right eye. One month prior, he had presented to the emergency department with binocular diplopia, bilateral cranial nerve 6 palsies, and an undifferentiated pontine mass on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Broad serologic workup results were negative, except for a positive syphilis total antibody with a nonreactive rapid plasma reagin test. Lumbar puncture with flow cytometry and cerebrospinal fluid venereal disease research laboratory test (CSF VDRL) result was also negative. The patient reported a history of syphilis treated with intramuscular penicillin 9 years prior. He was treated with systemic corticosteroids and discharged home on a steroid taper. On our examination, his visual acuity was count fingers in the right eye and 20/20 in the left. He had a right afferent pupillary defect and intraocular pressures were 12 in the right eye and 11 in the left. Anterior segment examination was normal. Posterior examination of the right eye revealed 3+ vitreous cell, 2+ vitreous haze, and a large optic nerve head mass with optic disc hyperemia, scattered dot hemorrhages, and a subtle placoid lesion in the posterior pole (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography of the optic nerve demonstrated a large spherical mass protruding out of the optic nerve head (Figure 1B) and granular disruption of the ellipsoid zone in adjacent peripapillary retina. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Syphilitic gumma of optic nerve head and presumed neurosyphilis,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:
1. **Neurosyphilis:** Given the history of syphilis, positive syphilis total antibody, and previous cranial nerve involvement.
2. **Optic Nerve Glioma:** Due to the presence of a large optic nerve head mass.
3. **Primary CNS Lymphoma:** Considering the undifferentiated pontine mass and the optic nerve involvement.
4. **Sarcoidosis:** Often presents with neurological symptoms and can affect the optic nerve.
5. **Multiple Sclerosis:** Can cause optic neuritis and may present with mass-like lesions in the central nervous system.
6. **Tuberculosis:** Granulomatous diseases like TB can present with similar neurological and ocular symptoms.
7. **Cryptococcal Meningitis:** Immunocompromised patients may present with cryptococcal lesions in the brain and optic nerve involvement.
8. **Behcet's Disease:** Can present with ocular inflammation and CNS involvement.
9. **Leukemia:** Can present with CNS involvement and optic nerve masses.
10. **Bartonella Henselae Infection:** Can cause neuroretinitis and optic nerve head lesions.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses Based on Results and Information:
1. **Neurosyphilis:** The patient's history of syphilis, positive antibody test, and atypical response to penicillin treatment.
2. **Primary CNS Lymphoma:** Given the undifferentiated pontine mass, negative infectious workup, and optic nerve mass.
3. **Sarcoidosis:** Due to the combination of neurological and ocular symptoms and nonreactive infectious tests.
4. **Optic Nerve Glioma:** The optic nerve mass is consistent with an optic glioma.
5. **Tuberculosis:** Granulomatous inflammation could explain the neurological and ocular symptoms, although less likely given the patient’s lack of systemic symptoms.
6. **Multiple Sclerosis:** The demyelinating disease could manifest as multifocal CNS and optic nerve involvement.
7. **Cryptococcal Meningitis:** Less likely due to the absence of other immunocompromised conditions or systemic fungal infection signs.
8. **Leukemia:** The CNS and optic nerve involvement align, but no hematological abnormalities noted.
9. **Behcet's Disease:** A possibility due to systemic inflammation and ocular involvement.
10. **Bartonella Henselae Infection:** While it can cause similar symptoms, it is less likely given the patient’s history and presentation.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 80s presented with mildly pruritic skin lesions on her upper and lower extremities that had progressively appeared during the previous month. The patient had no systemic symptoms or unexplained weight loss. Physical examination revealed erythematous, nondesquamative, annular plaques, some of which had overlying vesicles in a cluster of jewels arrangement on the flexor aspect of both wrists and lower limbs (Figure 1). There was no mucosal involvement, and the Nikolsky sign test result was negative. Chest radiography results were normal and laboratory studies—complete blood cell count, kidney, and hepatic function; urinalysis; and indirect immunofluorescence—were unremarkable except for positive circulating IgG against desmoglein-1 antigen. A skin biopsy specimen was collected from a lesion on the anterior aspect of the left wrist for histopathologic and immunofluorescent analyses, and treatment with oral prednisone (30 mg/d) tapering for 1 month was initiated.

2. **Bullous Pemphigoid**: Common in elderly, vesicular lesions but typically involves the trunk more than extremities.
3. **Dermatitis Herpetiformis**: Pruritic vesicles but commonly associated with celiac disease and placed in clusters, often near elbows, knees, and buttocks.
4. **Bullous Lupus Erythematosus**: Might present with vesicles and plaques, but more systemic involvement and linked with lupus indicators.
5. **Lichen Planus**: Can present with pruritic, purple, polygonal papules and plaques, often on flexor surfaces.
6. **Psoriasis**: Can have erythematous plaques but typically with more scaling (nondesquamative features in the given case).
7. **Erythema Multiforme**: Typically involves more widespread lesion distribution, including mucosal involvement, which was absent here.
8. **Contact Dermatitis**: Can present with itchy rash and vesicles but typically follows exposure to an allergen/irritant with a more acute and localized pattern.
9. **Impetigo**: Presents with vesicular and bullous lesions but usually with more yellowish crusting and focused on face, primarily in children.
10. **Urticaria**: Wheals and hives are typical, usually transient, and less commonly vesicular.

### INPUT:
An 11-year-old boy presented to our department with progressive unilateral skin hardening on his right thigh and buttock for 7 years. Recently, the motion of his right limb joint was slightly limited. He was born to healthy parents and did not have any medical disease. On physical examination, there was an ill-defined, stony-hard plaque involving his right thigh above the patella extending to his right buttocks with loss of skin elasticity. The affected skin was associated with mild hypertrichosis and hyperpigmentation (Figure 1A). Laboratory tests revealed normal results for routine blood tests, autoantibodies, immunoglobulins, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Magnetic resonance imaging of the right thigh demonstrated slight thickening of subcutaneous tissue and T2 signal abnormality (Figure 1B). A skin biopsy was taken from the affected thigh for histopathological examination and alcian blue staining. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Segmental stiff skin syndrome,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps

**Step 1:** **Morphea (Localized scleroderma)**  
Morphea is a condition characterized by excessive collagen deposition leading to hard, indurated plaques on the skin, often leading to loss of skin elasticity.

**Step 2:** **Linear scleroderma**  
Linear scleroderma is a variant of localized scleroderma with a linear distribution pattern, which can potentially affect underlying tissues including bones and muscles, leading to joint limitations.

**Step 3:** **Parry-Romberg Syndrome**  
This is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive hemifacial atrophy that could extend to the limbs in some cases, leading to unilateral skin changes.

**Step 4:** **Eosinophilic fasciitis**  
Eosinophilic fasciitis presents with symmetrical skin induration and fascia involvement, usually in the limbs, with accompanying eosinophilia in blood tests (which is not seen in this case).

**Step 5:** **Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus**  
This condition produces white, atrophic plaques that can lead to sclerosis, although usually affecting genital regions, can potentially cause skin indurations elsewhere.

**Step 6:** **Dermatomyositis**  
Dermatomyositis includes skin manifestations such as Gottron's papules and heliotrope rash, it involves muscle weakness and systemic symptoms however normal laboratory markers make this less likely.

**Step 7:** **Lipodermatosclerosis**  
This condition usually affects the lower legs leading to skin induration and hyperpigmentation, associated with chronic venous insufficiency.

**Step 8:** **Scleromyxedema**  
A rare fibroblastic disorder leading to widespread skin sclerosis, accompanied by mucin deposition in the dermis which can present with normal routine laboratory tests.

**Step 9:** **Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)**  
GVHD can cause skin sclerosis and resembles scleroderma, typically seen in patients with a history of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.

**Step 10:** **Congenital hemihypertrophy**  
This condition involves unilateral overgrowth of body parts, but with the patient's features leaning more towards skin induration and with no medical history, it's less likely.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis
Based on the clinical presentation, laboratory results, MRI findings, and histopathological examination, the differential diagnosis can be reranked as follows:

1. **Linear scleroderma**  
2. **Morphea**  
3. **Scleromyxedema**  
4. **Parry-Romberg Syndrome**  
5. **Eosinophilic fasciitis**  
6. **Dermatomyositis**  
7. **Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus**  
8. **Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)**  
9. **Lipodermatosclerosis**  
10. **Congenital hemihypertrophy**  

### Explanation:
- **Linear scleroderma** ranks highest due to the lesion's linear distribution, skin hardening, and joint limitation.
- **Morphea** fits due to unilateral skin stiffness and plaque formation, though not necessarily progressing for 7 years.
- **Scleromyxedema** should be considered due to normal lab results and possible similar presentation.
- **Parry-Romberg Syndrome** and **Eosinophilic fasciitis** follow due to somewhat similar presentations but with some inconsistencies.
- **GVHD** is ranked lower due to the lack of transplantation history, despite the cutaneous similarities.","['Dermatology', 'Connective Tissue Disease of the Skin', 'Pediatrics']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,M

### INPUT:
A woman in her 30s with myasthenia gravis diagnosed at age 27 years presented to the emergency department with severe erythroderma over the past 2 months. She had excision of a thymoma 10 years before, which was classified as type B2 according to the World Health Organization histologic classification system. She reported severe pruritus in the affected area. She had no history of skin diseases, allergies, or cardiovascular disease. Medications for the patient’s myasthenia gravis included prednisone tablets (20 mg daily), tacrolimus (1.5 mg twice per day), pyridostigmine bromide (30 mg daily), and losartan potassium (50 mg daily) for hypertension. On presentation, the patient’s temperature was 37.8 °C; heart rate, 120 beats/min, blood pressure, 120/65 mm Hg; and oxygen saturation levels, 97% on room air. On physical examination, the confluent erythema with scales involved more than 95% of body surface area, including the patient’s head, trunk (Figure 1A), and extremities, but results on mucosal examination were unremarkable. Laboratory testing results revealed whole white blood cell count of 12 200/μL (81.6% neutrophils; to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001); C-reactive protein levels, 5.58 mg/dL (to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10.0); aspartate aminotransferase levels, 0.7 µkat/L (to convert to IU/L, multiply by 0.0167); alanine aminotransferase levels, 45 IU/L (to convert to µkat/L, multiply by 0.0167); and lactate dehydrogenase levels, 454 IU/L (to convert to µkat/L, multiply by 0.0167).

9. **Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris**
10. **Paraneoplastic Pemphigus**

**Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information:**

1. **Drug-induced Erythroderma**
   - **Reasoning:** The patient has been taking multiple medications for myasthenia gravis, including prednisone and tacrolimus, both of which can cause drug-induced erythroderma.
   
2. **Exfoliative Dermatitis (Erythroderma)**
   - **Reasoning:** The clinical presentation of confluent erythema with scales over more than 95% of the body surface area is consistent with erythroderma.
   
3. **Sezary Syndrome (Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma)**
   - **Reasoning:** Given the severity and the disseminated nature of the skin involvement, a hematologic malignancy like Sezary syndrome should be considered.
   
4. **Psoriasis**
   - **Reasoning:** Although less likely, severe psoriasis can present with erythroderma-like symptoms, especially in the absence of a known history of skin disease.
   
5. **Paraneoplastic Pemphigus**
   - **Reasoning:** Given her history of thymoma excision, a malignancy-associated condition like paraneoplastic pemphigus may be relevant.
   
6. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**
   - **Reasoning:** While typically involving mucosal surfaces, atypical presentations of pemphigus may occur.
   
7. **Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris**
   - **Reasoning:** Rare, but it can present with generalized erythroderma and should be considered.
   
8. **Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus**
   - **Reasoning:** Lupus can present with significant skin involvement, although it typically also involves other systemic features not described here.
   
9. **Dermatomyositis**
   - **Reasoning:** Has skin and muscle involvement, but the absence of muscle symptoms makes it less likely.
   
10. **Atopic Dermatitis**
    - **Reasoning:** Unlikely given the severity and the lack of personal or family history of atopy, but can present with significant skin involvement.","['Myasthenia Gravis', 'Neurology', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Dermatology']",0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,30.0,F

### INPUT:
A 37-year-old woman, gravida 1 para 0, at 29 weeks’ gestation, underwent amniocentesis due to a suspected polycystic kidney detected on routine fetal ultrasonography. While no genetic abnormality associated with polycystic kidney was identified (whole-exome sequencing Invitae), an incidental finding of a heterozygous c.501-2 A<G sequence variant (SV) in the RB1 gene was noted. This specific RB1 SV had not been previously reported in any genetic databases, but was deemed pathogenic by Invitae, the commercial laboratory, in line with the American College of Medical Genetics and their guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants.1 No intraocular tumors were found on fetal sonography. There was no discernable family history of retinoblastoma or ocular disorders, and complete ophthalmic evaluation of both parents was normal with no suspected retinomas. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",RB1 pathogenic sequence variant in a 29-week-old fetus with no family history or sonographic features suggestive of retinoblastoma.,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Retinoblastoma**: Given the heterozygous c.501-2 A<G variant in the RB1 gene, which is recognized as pathogenic.
  
2. **Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD)**: Initially suspected due to the findings on fetal ultrasonography.

3. **Nephroblastoma (Wilms Tumor)**: Considered due to possible overlapping phenotypic presentations with kidney abnormalities.

4. **Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)**: Polycystic kidney disease can sometimes mimic the renal manifestations of TSC.

5. **Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney (MCDK)**: A differential diagnosis when renal cysts are identified on imaging.

6. **Congenital Mesoblastic Nephroma (CMN)**: Another renal neoplasm that could present similarly on ultrasonography.

7. **Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS)**: Renal anomalies, such as nephromegaly, can be part of this syndrome.

8. **Medullary Sponge Kidney**: Characterized by cystic dilations in the renal medulla.

9. **Meckel-Gruber Syndrome**: A lethal condition with renal cystic dysplasia, often identified via prenatal sonography.

10. **Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS)**: Genetic disorder with potential cystic kidney disease among other systemic manifestations.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

Considering the full range of patient information and the incidental genetic findings:

1. **Retinoblastoma**: Primary over others due to the identified RB1 gene pathogenic variant, despite no tumors detected yet.
  
2. **Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD)**: The initial ultrasonography finding makes this very probable.
  
3. **Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS)**: Needs consideration due to possible renal implications and genetic overlap.
  
4. **Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney (MCDK)**: Differential diagnosis with PKD and considered closely following the primary findings.
  
5. **Nephroblastoma (Wilms Tumor)**: Critical to rule out given the potential for a serious tumor.
  
6. **Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)**: Also significant due to possible mimicry of renal findings.
  
7. **Congenital Mesoblastic Nephroma (CMN)**: A less likely but important differential for understanding the renal mass.
  
8. **Meckel-Gruber Syndrome**: Though less likely, significant due to renal manifestations.
  
9. **Medullary Sponge Kidney**: Lower in the ranks but should not be entirely excluded.
  
10. **Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS)**: Rare, given the lack of other syndromic features but noteworthy for differential context.","['Genetics and Genomics', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Cancer Genetics', 'Obstetrics']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,37.0,F

### INPUT:
A 62-year-old woman presented with painless vision reduction and eye redness in the right eye for a week. The initial best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 4/20 (approximately 20/100), and an irregular superficial corneal ulcer with an epithelial defect size of 3 mm × 5 mm was found in the center of edematous cornea. She received penetrating keratoplasty 4 months later, as the ulcer did not heal with intensive medication. Then, topical tobramycin dexamethasone, topical tacrolimus, and daily oral prednisone, 40 mg, were prescribed, with a gradual taper of prednisone to a maintenance dose of 10 mg. At 5-month postoperative follow-up, some thin snowflakelike matter was found deposited on the iris and in the angle, with rare cell and mild flare in the anterior chamber. She was then diagnosed with uveitis and subsequently prescribed topical prednisone, subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide, oral prednisone, 40 mg, and daily intravenous ganciclovir, 5 mg/kg. An aqueous sample was obtained for diagnostic polymerase chain reaction, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected with a DNA load of 3.12 × 107 cells. Nine months after the keratoplasty, when she presented to the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, her BCVA was 2/100 OD (approximately 20/1000 OD), and her intraocular pressure was 19 mm Hg. Diffuse tiny nodules were observed all over the iris, along with more snowflake and severe cataract (Figure 1A). The fundus could not be seen. B-ultrasonography showed a dense opacity in the anterior vitreous body (Figure 1B).

7. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis**
8. **Fungal Keratitis**
9. **Sarcoidosis**
10. **Ocular lymphoma**

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Herpetic Eye Disease (possibly due to Epstein-Barr virus)**
   - Presence of EBV DNA in aqueous sample.
   - Characteristic presentation of snowflake deposits and uveitis.
   
2. **Chronic anterior uveitis**
   - Ongoing inflammation and presence of snowflake-like deposits, thin nodules, and flare in anterior chamber.
   
3. **Cataract**
   - Severe cataract mentioned in the examination.
   
4. **Intraocular inflammation/infectious endophthalmitis**
   - Generalized inflammation evidenced by B-ultrasonography and anterior chamber findings.
   
5. **Corneal ulcer**
   - Initial presentation of an irregular superficial corneal ulcer.
   
6. **Ocular lymphoma**
   - Persistent and unresolved intraocular inflammation, dense opacity, and nodules on the iris making differential diagnosis important.
   
7. **Fungal Keratitis**
   - Despite the ongoing treatment, corneal involvement could be fungal, though specialized fungal testing should be conclusive.
   
8. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Consideration given the systemic immunologic nature and uveitis correlation.
   
9. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis**
   - Immunocompromised state from steroids could predispose.
   
10. **Glaucoma (from increased intraocular pressure)**
    - Elevated intraocular pressure in follow-up.

The diagnosis most consistent with the available information and the structured clinical findings is **Herpetic Eye Disease**, likely compounded by **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)** involvement. Further investigations and a multi-disciplinary approach confirm treatment efficacy and rule out secondary diagnoses.","['Cornea', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Intraocular Tumors', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology']",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,62.0,F

### INPUT:
A full-term girl was born with multiple areas of erythema, vesicles, and bullae on the face, trunk, and extremities. Her vital signs, including temperature, respiration, and heart rate, were within normal ranges. One month later, she returned due to skin eruptions that continued to wax and wane. Physical examination revealed multiple round or irregularly shaped erythematous macules and slightly scaly plaques of various sizes on the face, trunk, and extremities. Bullous and vesicular lesions were observed on the thighs, with scattered facial erosions. Mucous membranes were not found to be affected. She was born to healthy, nonconsanguineous parents. Growth and development were normal for her age and sex. The patient’s family medical history was unremarkable. A skin-punch biopsy and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) assays taken from 1 of the erythematous scaly plaques were performed for further analysis. At the 3-year follow-up, it was found that the vesicles and bullae began to decrease in number when she was 6 months old but intermittently returned after 1 year of age. The number of annular hyperkeratotic plaques had increased (Figure 1A). Thickened, brown, corrugated plaques developed over the neck, armpits, wrists, and ankles, along with palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Annular epidermolytic ichthyosis,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Primary Care Step**
   - **Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB)**: A group of rare genetic conditions causing fragile skin that easily forms blisters and erosions.
   
2. **Specialist Referral Step**
   - **Bullous Impetigo**: An infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus leading to vesicles and bullae, typically in infants and children.
   
3. **Histopathological Analysis Step**
   - **Incontinentia Pigmenti**: A genetic disorder affecting the skin, leading to blistering and hyperkeratotic lesions, mainly in female infants.

4. **Genetic Testing Step**
   - **Linear IgA Bullous Dermatosis**: An autoimmune blistering disorder that can present with vesicles and bullae in a characteristic distribution.

5. **Immunofluorescence Assay Step**
   - **Bullous Pemphigoid**: An autoimmune blistering disorder that typically affects the elderly but can occasionally present in children.

6. **Dermatology Consultation Step**
   - **Neonatal Lupus**: A rare condition associated with maternal autoantibodies, leading to skin lesions in newborns.

7. **Family History Examination Step**
   - **Ichthyosis Linearis Circumflexa**: A variant of Netherton syndrome causing recurrent ichthyosis and scaly plaques.

8. **Long-term Follow-up Observation Step**
   - **Congenital Erythropoietic Porphyria**: A rare genetic disorder causing photosensitivity and bullous lesions at birth.

9. **Biopsy of Hyperkeratotic Plaques Step**
   - **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**: A condition causing lytic bone lesions and a variety of skin manifestations, including crusted papules and vesicles.

10. **Analysis of Palmoplantar Hyperkeratosis Step**
    - **Eczema Herpeticum**: Secondary herpes simplex virus infection occurring in patients with underlying eczema or dermatitis.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Incontinentia Pigmenti**: The patient's presentation of erythema, vesicles, and bullae at birth, with the progressive development of hyperkeratotic plaques, aligns closely with this genetic disorder.
   
2. **Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB)**: Characteristics of fragile skin with blistering and erosions make this a strong candidate, though not favored over Incontinentia Pigmenti based on patient history.

3. **Linear IgA Bullous Dermatosis**: Autoimmune condition presenting in infants with vesicles and bullae, supported by immunofluorescence assay results.

4. **Bullous Impetigo**: Despite typical infection patterns and response to treatment, chronicity and waxing-waning of lesions suggest an alternative diagnosis.

5. **Bullous Pemphigoid**: Considered due to the presence of bullous lesions but less likely in pediatric populations.

6. **Congenital Erythropoietic Porphyria**: Rare presentation with photosensitivity might match features but still less likely without supportive lab findings.

7. **Ichthyosis Linearis Circumflexa**: Differential based on hyperkeratotic plaques but genetic testing should be quite revealing.

8. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**: Possible but the primarily chronic blistering with no noted bone lesions makes it a weaker candidate.

9. **Neonatal Lupus**: Presence of lesions in newborns but the absence of maternal autoimmune history makes it less likely.

10. **Eczema Herpeticum**: Typically secondary and acute in presentation, not matching the chronic course described.

By systematically analyzing the patient's presentation and test results, Incontinentia Pigmenti emerges as the leading diagnosis.","['Dermatology', 'Pediatrics', 'Neonatology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,F

### INPUT:
A 65-year-old man presented to an outpatient department with a 2-year history of left nasal obstruction. He had a history of hypertension and was taking oral medication (amlodipine [5 mg]/valsartan [80 mg] and indapamide [1.5 mg] once daily) but had poorly controlled systolic blood pressure ranging from 130 to 160 mm Hg. No associated trauma or surgical history was reported. Physical examination revealed a large tumor originating from the olfactory groove in the left nasal cavity, with feeding vessels pushing the middle turbinate outward. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a well-defined and strongly enhancing mass in the left nasal cavity, with obstructive rhinosinusitis in the frontal and ethmoid sinuses (Figure 1A). During surgical exploration, the tumor abutted the superior end of the nasal septum near the cribriform plate. Tumor excision was completed with a surgical margin of at least 5 mm, with the perichondrium of the nasal septum as the deep margin. The feeding vessels of the tumors were cauterized during the resection. Gross examination revealed a 4.8 × 3.0 × 1.8-cm whitish to pink-tan mass lesion (Figure 1B). Histopathological examination revealed sheetlike proliferation of monomorphic ovoid to spindle tumor cells containing ectatic vascular spaces. In addition, immunohistochemical staining showed positive staining for smooth-muscle actin, cyclin D1, and nuclear expression of β-catenin and negative staining for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin, and CD34. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Glomangiopericytoma,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps

1. **Sinonasal hemangiopericytoma**: Given the patient's age, presentation, and histopathological features such as ectatic vascular spaces and immunohistochemical profile, this vascular tumor is a strong consideration.

2. **Olfactory neuroblastoma**: Although less likely due to negative immunohistochemical markers for neural origin (e.g., synaptophysin, chromogranin), it is considered due to the tumor's location near the olfactory groove and cribriform plate.

3. **Sinonasal adenocarcinoma**: While negative for cytokeratin, its consideration is due to its sinonasal origins and destructive potential.

4. **Nasal cavity melanoma**: Although immunohistochemistry does not support this diagnosis (usually positive for HMB-45, Melan-A), its aggressive nature warrants consideration.

5. **Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC)**: Less likely due to the detailed differentiation and immunoprofile, but considered due to its sinonasal origins and aggressive presentation.

6. **Schneiderian papilloma**: A benign epithelial neoplasm, but the histopathological features make this unlikely. 

7. **Fibrosarcoma**: Due to the spindle cell morphology, but typically would stain differently on immunohistochemistry.

8. **Chondrosarcoma**: Consideration given the tumor's location and morphology, but lacks chondroid matrix histology.

9. **Meningioma with sinonasal extension**: Although meningioma typically shows EMA positivity, it presents similarly when extending to the nasal cavity.

10. **Rhinoscleroma**: Less likely, given the histological evidence does not support a granulomatous inflammatory disease.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Sinonasal hemangiopericytoma**: Histopathological and immunohistochemical profile fits best with this diagnosis.
2. **Olfactory neuroblastoma**: Tumor location is consistent, though immunoprofile is not supportive.
3. **Sinonasal adenocarcinoma**: Considered despite negative markers, due to sinonasal tumor presentation.
4. **Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC)**: Aggressive behavior in the sinonasal region, though immunoprofile is less supportive.
5. **Meningioma with sinonasal extension**: Potential confusion due to proximity to cribriform plate and presenting similarly when invasive.
6. **Nasal cavity melanoma**: Unlikely due to immunoprofile, but considered due to tumor characteristics.
7. **Chondrosarcoma**: Morphology consideration without supportive matrix histology.
8. **Schneiderian papilloma**: Benign epithelial neoplasm with inconsistent histopathological findings.
9. **Rhinoscleroma**: Rare granulomatous inflammatory disease, not supporting histologically.
10. **Fibrosarcoma**: Spindle cell morphology consideration but immunohistochemically less supportive.","['Otolaryngology', 'Rhinology and Sinus Disease']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,65.0,M

### INPUT:
A patient in his mid-60s with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis underwent bilateral orthotopic lung transplant (BOLT) 6 months earlier. He was hospitalized for sepsis from pneumonia complicated by acute transplant rejection, without any cardiac symptoms. Coronary angiography prior to BOLT showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. His only cardiac history was tricuspid valve repair at the time of BOLT. His baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure 1A. He progressed to having severe acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intubation. As he continued to worsen, the decision was made to paralyze him a few hours later. Changes on telemetry were noted. Shortly thereafter, 12-lead ECG showed the changes in Figure 1B. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Apical pulsation caused by paralysis of the intercostal muscles,"Let's conduct a 10-step differential diagnosis focusing on potential causes for the observed ECG changes in the context of the patient's history and current condition. Each diagnosis will build upon the patient's medical background and recent clinical events.

1. **Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)**
2. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)**
3. **Hyperkalemia**
4. **Hypokalemia**
5. **Cardiac Tamponade**
6. **Sepsis-induced Cardiomyopathy**
7. **Drug-induced QT Prolongation**
8. **Pericarditis**
9. **Hypoxia-induced Arrhythmia**
10. **Acute Right Heart Failure**

### Reranking Differential Diagnoses Based on Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)**: Given the lack of evidence for coronary artery disease, this is less likely, but cannot be completely ruled out initially.
2. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)**: Severe ARDS and intubation increase PE risk.
3. **Hyperkalemia**: Common in critically ill patients, especially those on paralytics and with potential renal dysfunction.
4. **Hypokalemia**: Electrolyte imbalances are also frequent in critically ill patients.
5. **Cardiac Tamponade**: Post BOLT complications can involve fluid accumulation leading to tamponade, although specific signs need confirmation.
6. **Sepsis-induced Cardiomyopathy**: Sepsis can exacerbate pre-existing heart conditions or lead to new cardiac dysfunction.
7. **Drug-induced QT Prolongation**: Possibly from medications given for the patient's critical condition.
8. **Pericarditis**: Less likely without typical symptoms or lack of history suggesting pericardial involvement.
9. **Hypoxia-induced Arrhythmia**: Secondary to severe ARDS; could cause significant ECG changes.
10. **Acute Right Heart Failure**: Can result from acute stressors in the setting of severe pulmonary issues, such as ARDS.

### Final Consideration:
Prioritizing diagnostics and immediate treatment:
- Assess serum electrolytes (K+, Mg++ levels).
- Check for signs of cardiac tamponade.
- Perform D-dimer or CT angiography to rule out PE.
- Immediate echocardiography could help identify structural abnormalities like tamponade or acute right heart failure.
- Cardiac enzymes (troponins) to assess for possible myocardial injury related causes.

### INPUT:
A 52-year-old presented to the rheumatology clinic with 3 weeks of pain and duskiness of the fingertips bilaterally. The patient reported no dyspnea, cough, nasal discharge, diarrhea weight loss, or fevers. She had no history of rheumatologic disease or Raynaud disease, did not smoke cigarettes, take daily medications, ingest raw meat, or report recent travel. On presentation, her temperature was 98.2 °F (36.8 °C); blood pressure, 132/70 mm Hg; heart rate, 86/min; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. Findings on the physical examination were normal, other than her fingertips, which were cold and cyanotic with small ulcerations on the second and third fingertips (Figure). White blood cell count was 25.1 × 109/L (reference range, 3.8-9.8 × 109/L) and manual differential revealed 74.5% eosinophils (absolute eosinophil count, 18.7 × 109/L) and no blasts. Hemoglobin level and platelet count were normal. D-dimer level was 1.5 μg/mL (8.21 nmol/L) (reference range, 0.0-0.99 μg/mL [0.0-5.42 nmol/L]). Test results were negative for antinuclear antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies against proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase, and HIV.

    ",Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome with peripheral arterial thrombosis.,"Based on the detailed patient history, physical exam findings, and diagnostic test results, we can construct a differential diagnosis list through a step-by-step process. Each diagnosis will be based on available clinical information, progressively moving from more common to rarer conditions.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

**Step 1:** Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome (EMS)

**Step 2:** Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA)

**Step 3:** Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES)

**Step 4:** Systemic Mastocytosis

**Step 5:** Paraneoplastic Syndrome

**Step 6:** Polycythemia Vera (due to possible microcirculatory disturbances)

**Step 7:** Scleroderma (systemic sclerosis)

**Step 8:** Thrombophilia (genetic thrombophilias such as Factor V Leiden)

**Step 9:** Drug-induced Eosinophilia (though she does not take daily medications, detailed review is needed)

**Step 10:** Infectious Causes (such as parasitic infection, reviewing for less common exposure)

### Reranking the Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

Considering the absence of known causes of secondary eosinophilia (like infection, allergies, or drugs), normal imaging findings, and the significant eosinophilia with cold, cyanotic fingers and small ulcerations, the adjusted differential diagnosis is:

1. **Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES)** - Given the very high eosinophil count and lack of secondary causes, this is a top consideration.
2. **Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA)** - Though ANCA negative, EGPA can present with marked eosinophilia and vasculitis symptoms.
3. **Systemic Mastocytosis** - Mast cell disorders can also present with high eosinophil counts and skin lesions.
4. **Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome (EMS)** - Rare, but fits the presentation of marked eosinophilia.
5. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - Consider a malignancy-related paraneoplastic syndrome, even though initial imaging is normal.
6. **Polycythemia Vera** - Microcirculatory issues could cause similar symptoms, though less likely without erythrocytosis.
7. **Scleroderma (systemic sclerosis)** - Could potentially present with fingertip ulcerations, though no other symptoms noted.
8. **Thrombophilia** - Less likely due to normal initial coagulation workup.
9. **Drug-induced Eosinophilia** - Despite the absence of declared medication use, detailed history review is warranted.
10. **Infectious Causes** - Though no typical exposures, parasitic infection needs consideration.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 20s presented with a firm, mobile, painful, and fast-growing subcutaneous nodule in the glabella (Figure 1). Ultrasonography performed in B mode with a high-frequency (6-18 MHz) linear transducer revealed a hypoechoic lesion with well-defined borders in the hypodermis. After 2 months, the nodule had increased and seemed to be adhered to deep layers. A computed tomography scan was performed, which showed a 0.8 × 1.5 × 1.5-cm ovoid subcutaneous lesion with well-defined borders located in the glabella. The lesion was not affecting the epidermis and reached the muscular layer in depth without eroding bone structures. Given these findings, the lesion was excised.

2. **Histiocytoma** - Similar presentation with firm, mobile, and sometimes painful lesions.
3. **Pilomatricoma** - Subcutaneous nodule, often firm and may adhere to deeper layers over time.
4. **Granuloma** - Can present as a painful, firm nodule with inflammation.
5. **Epidermoid Cyst** - Common subcutaneous nodule that can grow and become painful.
6. **Leiomyoma** - Firm, painful, and mobile characteristic, though less common.
7. **Neurofibroma** - Presents as a firm, mobile nodule but typically less painful.
8. **Lipoma** - Usually painless but can be firm and mobile.
9. **Sebaceous Cyst** - Mobile and firm but less likely to be painful initially.
10. **Fibroma** - Mobile, firm but usually painless and slow-growing.

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old woman was evaluated for generalized dystonia, dysarthria, dysphagia, severe scoliosis, and motor development disorder that began in her childhood. Born by cesarean delivery to nonconsanguineous parents, she developed difficulties with head control, standing, and feeding at age 10 months. Subsequently, she faced progressive motor challenges (walking, speech, and swallow); contractures in her fingers, toes, wrists, and knees; and scoliosis. In adolescence, she experienced progressive stiffness, episodes of painful spasms and oculomotor crisis, and galactorrhea unrelated to childbirth in adulthood. Her symptoms worsened with age and progressed to her using a wheelchair, having difficulty in speech, and not having access to education. She had a younger brother with similar symptoms who passed away at age 20 years of unknown causes. Upon presentation at age 31 years, she was admitted to our center for further evaluation. She had thin limbs and was of standard height. The neurological and psychological examinations revealed scoliosis, contractures in her fingers and toes, carpal inversion, dysarthria, dysphagia, hypertonia, decreased tendon reflexes, absence of Babinski sign (Figure, A and B), and no psychiatric problems. Blood test results indicated hyperprolactinemia (prolactin level of 47.40 ng/mL; to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1). An electroencephalogram revealed atypical spike-slow wave synchronization in specific brain regions during sleep. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed significant global atrophy particularly in her anterior temporal, lateral, and frontal regions (Figure, C). Levodopa treatment was initiated but quickly resulted in drug-induced hyperkinesia (Video).

2. **Rett Syndrome** - Given the developmental regression and dystonia.
3. **Huntington's Disease** - Due to motor difficulties, psychiatric disturbances, and family history could be considered.
4. **Friedreich’s Ataxia** - Neuromuscular symptoms, scoliosis, and dysarthria point to this potential diagnosis.
5. **Niemann-Pick Disease Type C** - With dystonia, cognitive decline, and ataxia.
6. **Spinocerebellar Ataxia** - Especially the neurodegenerative ataxias could be relevant.
7. **Dopa-Responsive Dystonia** - Given the initial response to levodopa treatment.
8. **Dystonia Plus Syndromes** - Complexes such as Parkinson’s plus (though less likely in younger patients).
9. **Leigh Syndrome (Subacute Necrotizing Encephalomyelopathy)** - Progressive neurodegeneration, dystonia, and MRI findings.

2. **Wilson's Disease** - Despite not specifying liver involvement, the global atrophy in MRI and dystonia support it.
3. **Niemann-Pick Disease Type C** - Progressive symptomatology and neurological findings are quite fitting.
4. **Niemann-Pick Disease Type C**- fits with motor neurodevelopmental deterioration, scoliosis, and MRI findings.
5. **Rett Syndrome** - Developmental regression and movement disorder in infancy align.
6. **Leigh Syndrome** - Fits neurological degeneration and MRI findings.
7. **Huntington's Disease** - Motor dysfunction and family history are consistent.
8. **Spinocerebellar Ataxia** - Different phenotypes could account for the diverse symptoms.
9. **Metachromatic Leukodystrophy** - Progressive degeneration and family history, although less common without clear leukodystrophy in MRI.
10. **Dopa-Responsive Dystonia** - Initial response to levodopa, although rapid progression might suggest otherwise.

1. **Kaposi's Sarcoma** - Given the presentation of dark violaceous nodules, particularly on a lower extremity in an elderly patient with an immunosuppressive condition (prolonged steroid use).
2. **Cutaneous B-cell Lymphoma** - Firm nodules could potentially indicate this type of lymphoma, especially given preserved arterial pulses.
3. **Epithelioid Sarcoma** - Typical in elderly patients with firm, nodular lesions that can appear similar to Kaposi’s Sarcoma.
4. **Cutaneous Metastases** - Multiple nodules can be indicative of a metastatic process, though secondary consideration due to the absence of primary tumor history.
5. **Deep Fungal Infection** - Chronic steroid use could predispose to fungal infections manifesting as nodular lesions.
6. **Melanoma** - The violaceous to dark-brown nodules could be mistaken for melanoma, though less likely considering multiple rather than singular primary lesions.
7. **Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer** - Firm, violaceous nodules could potentially mislead towards a nonmelanoma skin cancer.
8. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum** - Inflammatory nodules usually associated with systemic symptoms like fever which are absent here.
9. **Nodular Vasculitis** - Usually presents with pain or systemic symptoms, which are not reported in this case.
10. **Lichen Planus** - Unlikely given the typical presentation with flat, polygonal, purple lesions rather than firm nodules.","['Pathology and Laboratory Medicine', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Dermatology', 'Oncology', 'Sarcomas']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,84.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his 50s underwent clinical assessment for a 4-month history of recurrent palpitations, fatigue, and progressive exertion dyspnea. He had no history of cardiac disease, and there was no family history of heart disease or sudden death. Physical examination revealed an irregular pulse and a systolic murmur at the heart apex. Holter monitoring and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings documented irregular narrow-QRS tachycardia in an incessant, repetitive fashion with heart rates up to 180 beats per minute and occasional short runs of wide-QRS tachycardia. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a dilated and diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle (ejection fraction, 30%) associated with moderate to severe functional mitral regurgitation. Blood test results were within normal limits, including thyroid function, C-reactive protein, and myocardial enzymes. The patient was hospitalized, and medical therapy was initiated, including ACE inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, β-blockers, and diuretics. Coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary stenoses. A representative 12-lead ECG of the arrhythmia is shown in Figure 1. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Dual atrioventricular nodal nonreentrant tachycardia,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps

1. **Atrial Fibrillation (AF)**
2. **Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)**
3. **Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP)**
4. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)**
5. **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**
6. **Atrial Flutter**
7. **Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)**
8. **Functional Mitral Regurgitation**
9. **Anemia**
10. **Sick Sinus Syndrome**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)** - Given the evidence of a dilated, diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with a reduced ejection fraction, this should be highly considered.
2. **Functional Mitral Regurgitation** - The echocardiogram findings support this due to moderate to severe regurgitation.
3. **Atrial Fibrillation (AF)** - The ECG findings of irregular narrow-QRS tachycardia align with AF.
4. **Atrial Flutter** - Considering the irregular tachycardia episodes, but less likely given the absence of typical flutter waves on the ECG.
5. **Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)** - Noted short runs of wide-QRS tachycardia, though less likely to be primary given the overall ECG findings.
6. **Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP)** - Systolic murmur heard at the apex could suggest MVP, but echocardiogram findings were more consistent with functional mitral regurgitation.
7. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)** - Lesser probability given the dilated nature of the ventricle rather than hypertrophic.
8. **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)** - Exertional dyspnea could hint at COPD, though respiratory findings and blood tests do not necessarily support this.
9. **Anemia** - Could contribute to fatigue and dyspnea but is less likely with normal blood test results.
10. **Sick Sinus Syndrome** - The rhythm disturbances fit, but secondary to other primary cardiac conditions suggested.

### INPUT:
A 50-year-old man with end-stage kidney disease receiving hemodialysis was admitted to the hospital for treatment of calciphylaxis and foot cellulitis. His home medications included sevelamer and hydrocodone-acetaminophen (10 mg/325 mg) every 8 hours as needed, which was increased to every 4 hours as needed in the hospital. Hydromorphone (0.5 mg intravenously as needed) was added for breakthrough pain. He was prescribed chewable lanthanum tablets (500 mg 3 times daily) for treatment of a blood phosphate level of 8.1 mg/dL (reference, 2.5-4.5 mg/dL). On hospital day 7, the patient developed intermittent apneic episodes, during which his oxygen saturation was 80% on room air; heart rate, 86/min; and blood pressure, 106/45 mm Hg. Physical examination revealed bilateral rhonchi and responsiveness to verbal commands only with deep painful stimulus. A chest radiograph showed 4 radio-opaque coin-shaped opacities in the stomach (Figure). After administration of oxygen at 2 L/min by nasal cannula and a naloxone infusion, his oxygen saturation increased to 98% and his mental status improved. The patient reported no foreign body ingestion. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Accidental ingestion of whole lanthanum tablets,"### 10-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Opioid overdose**
2. **Hyperphosphatemia**
3. **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**
4. **Central sleep apnea**
5. **Aspiration pneumonia**
6. **Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**
7. **Pulmonary edema**
8. **Sepsis secondary to foot cellulitis**
9. **Pulmonary embolism**
10. **Pulmonary calcification (due to end-stage renal disease)**

### Re-ranking of Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Opioid overdose** - The patient’s intermittent apneic episodes, low oxygen saturation, improved oxygenation after oxygen therapy and naloxone infusion, and increased dose of opioids (both oral and intravenous), strongly suggest opioid-induced respiratory depression.
2. **Pulmonary calcification (due to end-stage renal disease)** - The chest radiograph finding of radio-opaque coin-shaped opacities in the stomach could be due to lanthanum tablets used for hyperphosphatemia, and pulmonary calcification can occur in ESRD.
3. **Hyperphosphatemia** - The patient’s high phosphate level (8.1 mg/dL) suggests hyperphosphatemia, which is managed with lanthanum tablets.
4. **Aspiration pneumonia** - Bilateral rhonchi and altered mental status could suggest aspiration pneumonia, particularly in a patient at risk due to sedation from opioids.
5. **Sepsis secondary to foot cellulitis** - The patient’s condition is complicated by calciphylaxis and cellulitis; sepsis could present with altered mental status and respiratory issues.
6. **Central sleep apnea** - Apneic episodes could be due to central sleep apnea, especially in the context of end-stage renal disease.
7. **COPD** - Chronic bronchitis and emphysema should be considered due to bilateral rhonchi, but less likely given the improvement with naloxone.
8. **Pulmonary embolism** - While a possible cause of sudden hypoxia, it's less supported by the rapid improvement with naloxone and lack of additional PE-specific symptoms.
9. **Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)** - ARDS could cause hypoxia and require oxygen, but the rapid improvement with naloxone is less typical.
10. **Pulmonary edema** - Could cause hypoxia and rhonchi but less likely without other typical findings. 

Given the patient's history, medications, and response to treatment, opioid overdose remains the most likely diagnosis.","['Acid Base, Electrolytes, Fluids', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Gastroenterology', 'Surgery', 'Radiology']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,50.0,M

### INPUT:
A healthy patient in their teens presented to the emergency department with high-grade fever (38.7 °C), neck pain, and a foreign body sensation in the throat after eating chicken 3 days prior. Laboratory investigations demonstrated an elevated leukocyte count (22 500/µL; to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Lateral soft tissue radiography showed a radio-opaque foreign body at the level of C6. Computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a 2-cm radio-opaque osseous foreign body at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle with signs of esophageal perforation, including air leak tracking toward the left lobe of the thyroid gland (Figure, A and B). The patient was brought to the operating room, and the esophageal foreign body was successfully removed. Postoperatively, the patient continued to become febrile despite intravenous antibiotic therapy. A repeated CT scan of the neck and chest was done (Figure, C). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Emphysematous thyroiditis,"Given the provided information, let's proceed step-by-step with the differential diagnosis process:

### Differential Diagnosis Development:

1. **Esophageal Perforation:** The confirmed presence of an esophageal perforation from imaging studies.
2. **Retropharyngeal Abscess:** High fever, neck pain, and the presence of a foreign body with esophageal perforation suggest the possibility of an abscess formation in the retropharyngeal space.
3. **Mediastinitis:** Esophageal perforation can lead to mediastinitis, an inflammation of the mediastinum.
4. **Thyroid Abscess:** The tracking of air toward the thyroid gland could indicate a secondary infection leading to a thyroid abscess.
5. **Parapharyngeal Abscess:** An extension of infection from the esophagus to the parapharyngeal space.
6. **Sepsis:** Persistent fever despite antibiotics could imply systemic infection due to the perforation.
7. **Ludwig’s Angina:** Although more common from dental infections, it could be considered due to neck infection.
8. **Subcutaneous Emphysema:** Could occur due to air leak from the perforated esophagus.
9. **Necrotizing Fasciitis:** Severe soft tissue infection that can present similarly and progress rapidly.
10. **Pneumonia:** Air leak could have led to pulmonary complications including pneumonia.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Retropharyngeal Abscess:** The combination of fever, neck pain, and foreign body with esophageal perforation makes this primary differential more likely.
2. **Mediastinitis:** The CT signs showing air leak confirm esophageal perforation and mediastinitis as a compelling diagnosis.
3. **Thyroid Abscess:** With air tracking towards the thyroid gland, secondary infection here is highly probable.
4. **Parapharyngeal Abscess:** Esophageal perforation causing air and infection to spread to adjacent spaces including the parapharyngeal space.
5. **Sepsis:** Persistent fever despite antibiotics raises concern for a systemic response.
6. **Pneumonia:** Given the proximity of the perforation and air leak, secondary pulmonary involvement is plausible.
7. **Ludwig’s Angina:** While less likely than other differentials, the neck infection could spread here.
8. **Esophageal Perforation:** Confirmed diagnosis, but primary concern is the complications arising from it.
9. **Subcutaneous Emphysema:** Air leak from perforation could lead to this, though not the primary cause of fever.
10. **Necrotizing Fasciitis:** Though less likely, needs consideration if rapid deterioration occurs.

### INPUT:
A 68-year-old man presented with progressive right-sided facial numbness and weakness, vision changes, and headaches. His symptoms began 5 years earlier with right temple numbness, which expanded to include the entire right face and mouth. He then developed progressive right facial weakness with a droop, slurred speech, and eyelid ptosis. Finally, binocular vertical and horizontal diplopia and periorbital headaches began. Trials of gabapentin and steroids provided no relief. His history was significant for a left cheek melanoma completely excised years prior, numerous cutaneous squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the bilateral head and neck removed without issue, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. His medications included metformin and simvastatin; he had no history of smoking or drinking. On examination, he had right-sided ptosis and severe right facial weakness in a lower motor neuron pattern with temporal wasting. The right pupil was fixed and dilated. There was no afferent pupillary defect. The left pupil was appropriately sized and reactive. His right-sided vision was impaired (20/250) with blurriness. Vertical and horizontal binocular diplopia was present. Right extraocular movements were significantly limited in all directions and painful, and right-sided facial sensation was diminished to pinprick in all cranial nerve (CN) V distributions. His speech was slightly slurred. Left-sided extraocular movements were intact. His left facial sensation was intact to pinprick, and his strength was without deficit. There were no other neurological abnormalities. Initial magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were unremarkable. A biopsy of CN VII was nondiagnostic. Hemoglobin A1c was 6.8%. Tests for infection and autoimmune disease had negative results. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies showed mildly elevated protein values. Figure 1 shows the MRI at presentation. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Trigeminal Neuralgia:** Given the facial numbness and involvement of cranial nerve V.
2. **Bell's Palsy:** Due to progressive right facial weakness and a lower motor neuron presentation.
3. **Myasthenia Gravis:** Considering ptosis and diplopia.
4. **Cranial Mononeuropathy:** Possible complication from diabetes affecting cranial nerves.
5. **Ischemic Stroke:** Given the acute onset of neurological deficits.
6. **Lyme Disease:** Facial paralysis and neuropathy can sometimes be attributed to Lyme.
7. **Metastatic Melanoma:** History of melanoma that could potentially metastasize to cranial nerves.
8. **Basal Cell Carcinoma Metastasis:** Considering multiple previous cutaneous basal cell carcinomas.
9. **Multiple Sclerosis:** Considering the chronic and progressively worsening symptoms.
10. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome:** Recurrent painful ophthalmoplegia could suggest this condition.

### Reranking Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Metastatic Melanoma:** History of melanoma, plus the progressive nature of the symptoms and cranial nerve involvement.
2. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome:** Recurrent painful ophthalmoplegia that aligns with the symptoms described.
3. **Basal Cell Carcinoma Metastasis:** Multiple previous basal cell carcinomas could suggest metastatic potential.
4. **Multiple Sclerosis:** Chronic and progressively worsening symptoms fit the clinical picture.
5. **Bell's Palsy:** Although not typical for recurrent and progressive symptoms, facial weakness aligns.
6. **Cranial Mononeuropathy:** Diabetes affects cranial nerves and causes neuropathy.
7. **Trigeminal Neuralgia:** Symptoms overlap but doesn't explain all systemic findings.
8. **Myasthenia Gravis:** Ptosis and diplopia present, less likely due to localized nature of the symptoms.
9. **Ischemic Stroke:** Unlikely due to MRI findings and chronic progression.
10. **Lyme Disease:** Less likely as tests for infections were negative.

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old man presented with left cervical and left inguinal masses. He reported intermittent itching and night sweats for 2 years. He denied fever, weight loss, shortness of breath, rashes, diarrhea, and neurological symptoms. On a preemployment evaluation, the patient was told he had a high white blood cell count 2 years ago. On examination, there was left cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy and no other organomegaly. Complete blood cell count and peripheral blood smear showed marked leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 22 340/μL, an absolute neutrophil count of 5360/μL, and 55% eosinophils with an absolute eosinophil count of 12 290/μL (to convert all to cells ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Vitamin B12 was markedly elevated at more than 4000 pg/mL (to convert to pmol/L, multiply by 0.7378). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm/h. Lactate dehydrogenase was 180 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase was 81 U/L (to convert both to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167). Evaluations for HIV and hepatitis B and C were all negative. Serum creatinine was 0.76 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4); alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were 11 U/L and 9.9 U/L, respectively (to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167); and total bilirubin was 0.35 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 17.104). Bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellular marrow (cellularity of 100%), myeloid hyperplasia, increased eosinophils with some dysplasia, and a blast count of 2%. Positron emission tomographic–computed tomographic scan showed a left upper cervical lymph node of 2.6 cm and a left inguinal lymph node of 3.1 × 2.3 cm with an standardized uptake value max of 5.7 (Figure, A). Left inguinal lymph node biopsy showed partial involvement by atypical cells with high proliferation index (Ki-67 >95%) that were positive for CD3, CD4, CD8, BCL2, and TDT, suggestive of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (Figure, B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia**: Given the biopsy results showing involvement by atypical T-cells and the high proliferation index.
2. **Chronic eosinophilic leukemia**: Due to marked eosinophilia and elevated B12.
3. **Hodgkin's lymphoma**: Given the lymphadenopathy and night sweats.
4. **Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma**: Also considering lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms.
5. **Hypereosinophilic syndrome**: Based on the elevated eosinophil count and systemic manifestations.
6. **Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)**: Due to elevated white blood cell count and myeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow.
7. **Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)**: Considered because of high white blood count and bone marrow findings.
8. **Systemic mastocytosis**: Due to elevated tryptase levels and eosinophilia, although no other Mastocytosis criteria are met.
9. **Reactive eosinophilia**: Could be secondary to a parasitic or other infection, although unlikely given negative tests.
10. **Allergic reaction**: Intermittent itching might suggest an allergic etiology, though less likely without other supportive findings.

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia**: Strongest support from biopsy showing involvement by atypical CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, BCL2+, TDT+ cells with high proliferation index.
2. **Chronic eosinophilic leukemia**: High eosinophil count, elevated B12, and hypercellular marrow.
3. **Hypereosinophilic syndrome**: Fits with clinical presentation and high eosinophil counts.
4. **Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)**: Elevated white blood cell count and myeloid hyperplasia.
5. **Hodgkin's lymphoma**: Lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms.
6. **Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma**: Given lymphadenopathy and systemic involvement.
7. **Reactive eosinophilia**: Consideration for secondary cause of elevated eosinophils.
8. **Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)**: Lower due to low blast count but still possible with dysplastic eosinophils.
9. **Systemic mastocytosis**: Considered less likely without further supportive findings.
10. **Allergic reaction**: Given the intermittent itching but low overall correlation with other findings.

### INPUT:
An 80-year-old man with stage II bladder carcinoma (T2NXM0) and atrial fibrillation treated with apixaban presented to the emergency department with 1 week of fatigue and 2 days of dyspnea on exertion. One week prior to presentation, he received a fourth cycle of carboplatin/gemcitabine for bladder carcinoma with 6 mg of pegylated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The patient reported no anorexia, fever, melena, hematemesis, hematuria, cough, orthopnea, or peripheral edema. His vital signs were normal except for a heart rate of 103/min. His white blood cell count was 22 × 103/μL (reference, 4-11 × 103/μL), increased from 4.8 × 103/μL 8 days prior. His manual differential, which was previously normal, showed 18% bands (0%-10%), 2% metamyelocytes, 7% myelocytes, 7% promyelocytes, and 6% blasts. His hemoglobin level was 5.2 g/dL (reference, 13-17 g/dL), decreased from 7.4 g/dL, and platelets were 25 × 103/μL (reference, 150-420 × 103/μL), decreased from 268 × 103/μL 8 days prior. Ferritin was 1423 ng/mL (reference, 300-400 ng/mL). Mean corpuscular volume, prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, haptoglobin, vitamin B12, and methylmalonic acid values were normal, and results of a direct antiglobulin test were negative. A computed tomography (CT) scan of his abdomen and pelvis was normal. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells and was admitted to the hospital. Flow cytometry identified a small population of CD34+/CD117+ cells (Figure). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)–induced increase in peripheral blasts,"Let's go through a 10-step differential diagnosis considering the provided patient information and test outcomes step by step.

**Step 9:** Hemolytic Anemia  
**Step 10:** Acute Blood Loss

Now, let's rerank these differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

1. **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)** – The presence of blasts, CD34+/CD117+ cells, and significant cytopenias (anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis with immature cells) strongly suggest AML.
2. **Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)** – The patient has pancytopenia and a varying degree of immature cells, common in MDS.
3. **Chemotherapy-Induced Bone Marrow Suppression** – Given recent chemotherapy, this is a probable cause for cytopenias.
4. **Aplastic Anemia** – Although less likely, aplastic anemia could present with similar hematological findings but usually without such significant leukocytosis and immature cells.
5. **Sepsis** – Leukocytosis with left shift can be seen in sepsis, but the lack of fever or clinical signs makes it less likely.
6. **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)** – DIC can cause thrombocytopenia and anemia, but normal coagulation tests make this diagnosis less probable.
7. **Iron Deficiency Anemia** – Considered but less likely due to lack of evidence of iron deficiency in the given tests.
8. **B12 Deficiency Anemia** – Normal B12 and MMA levels make this unlikely.
9. **Hemolytic Anemia** – Negative DAT and other normal hemolysis markers (e.g., haptoglobin, bilirubin) make this diagnosis unlikely.
10. **Acute Blood Loss** – No evidence of active bleeding in the history or clinical findings.

### INPUT:
An 81-year-old White woman noted decreased vision in her left eye for 6 months. She was referred to the Ocular Oncology Service, Wills Eye Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for suspected choroidal melanoma. She disclosed a history of macular degeneration in both eyes and retinal detachment in the left eye that was treated 35 years previously. Medical history revealed cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, both treated surgically. On examination, visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/400 OS. External examination showed posterior-chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes and conjunctival scarring in the left eye from circumferential scleral buckle surgery with no visible extraocular tumor. Fundus evaluation showed macular drusen in the right eye and a pale optic disc with geographic macular atrophy in the left eye, explaining her visual acuity of 20/400 OS. In addition, a shallow circumferential buckle effect and an inferotemporal mass measuring 15.0 × 10.0 mm in basal dimension and 9.1 mm in thickness (Figure, A) were seen in the left eye. The mass appeared elevated, amelanotic with overlying retinal vasculature, and with chorioretinal atrophy. No retinal detachment or breaks were seen. By ultrasonography the mass was echolucent (Figure, A inset). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a T1, T2-hypointense shallow circumferential band in the left eye. In addition, there was an inferotemporal nodular mass in the left eye showing T1 (gadolinium) hypointense, T2-hyperintense features, underlying the encircling buckle, and with adjacent subtle delineation. There was no enhancement with gadolinium (Figure, B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Expanded hydrogel scleral sponge,"Given the detailed clinical presentation and findings, let's step through a differential diagnosis process:

1. **Choroidal Melanoma**  
   - The initial suspicion for the patient's condition is choroidal melanoma based on the presence of an elevated mass in the left eye.

2. **Choroidal Metastasis**  
   - The age of the patient and the presence of a new ocular mass could raise the suspicion of metastatic disease to the choroid.

3. **Choroidal Hemangioma**  
   - A vascular lesion, often mistaken for melanoma, could be responsible for the mass.

4. **Ocular Lymphoma**  
   - Lymphoma can present with an intraocular mass and needs to be considered, especially given the lack of typical melanoma pigmentation.

5. **Retinal Capillary Hemangioblastoma**  
   - Although rare, this vascular tumor can present as a mass within the eye and is associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease.

6. **Retinoblastoma (in elderly)**  
   - Although extremely rare in adults, any troubling intraocular mass warrants including even less likely possibilities.

7. **Sclerochoroidal Calcification**  
   - This condition can mimic a mass in the periphery of the eye, typically seen in older adults.

8. **Subretinal Hemorrhage**  
   - Conditions such as macular degeneration can sometimes lead to subretinal hemorrhage forming mass-like elevations.

9. **Idiopathic Choroidal Effusion**  
   - An idiopathic effusion could present as echolucent lesions on ultrasound, simulating other intraocular masses.

10. **Melanocytoma**  
   - Although benign, these pigmented tumors can occasionally be large and concerning for melanoma.

Now, let's consolidate and rerank these differential diagnoses based on the detailed patient information and test results presented:

1. **Choroidal Melanoma**  
   - Despite being amelanotic, the mass's size and presentation strongly support this diagnosis. The echolucency on ultrasonography and clinical suspicion align with this conclusion.

2. **Choroidal Hemangioma**  
   - The mass's characteristics, notably being elevated and lacking retinal detachment, can be indicative of a hemangioma.

3. **Choroidal Metastasis**  
   - Given the patient's age and history of treated cancers, metastasis remains a significant possibility, despite imaging features.

4. **Ocular Lymphoma**  
   - Lymphoma should stay high on the list given the presentation, especially since it can present in various forms including amelanotic masses.

5. **Sclerochoroidal Calcification**  
   - The echolucent quality on ultrasonography suggests this benign condition could be a consideration in older adults.

6. **Subretinal Hemorrhage**  
   - Secondary to age-related macular degeneration, subretinal hemorrhage forming a mass might be possible but less likely without typical additional findings.

7. **Idiopathic Choroidal Effusion**  
   - Given the echolucent features, an effusion could be mistaken for a solid mass.

8. **Melanocytoma**  
   - Although generally benign and typically pigmented, it remains on the differential due to physical presentation.

9. **Retinal Capillary Hemangioblastoma**  
   - The specific clinical and radiological features don’t strongly suggest this diagnosis over others.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 30s presented with progressive, multiple itchy erythematous to violaceous papules and plaques localized to the left shin for more than 10 years (Figure, A and B). On close inspection, milia and a few erosions with partially detached epidermis were identified. There were no abnormalities of the mucous membranes, nails, hair, or teeth. No extracutaneous involvement was observed. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa (EBP),"### Differential Diagnosis Step-by-Step:

1. **Lichen Planus**: Lichen planus often presents with multiple, pruritic, violaceous papules and plaques, which can persist for many years.

2. **Lupus Erythematosus**: Cutaneous forms, including discoid lupus erythematosus, can present with erythematous plaques and papules, particularly on sun-exposed skin.

3. **Sarcoidosis**: This can present with chronic erythematous to violaceous papules and plaques, although systemic involvement is commonly seen.

4. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica**: Often seen in diabetic patients, this condition shows erythematous to yellow-brown plaques, typically on the lower legs.

5. **Prurigo Nodularis**: Characterized by intensely pruritic nodules and plaques, commonly on the extensor surfaces.

6. **Granuloma Annulare**: Presents with annular or arcuate erythematous plaques, typically on the extremities. Papules can be flesh-colored to erythematous.

7. **Erythema Elevatum Diutinum (EED)**: Presents with erythematous to brownish papules and plaques, commonly on extensor surfaces.

8. **Dermatomyositis**: While mild papules and plaques can be seen, this condition usually also involves muscle weakness and characteristic findings like heliotrope rash.

9. **Psoriasis**: It typically presents as well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with silvery scale, often on the extensor surfaces.

10. **Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)**: Can present as persistent erythematous patches, plaques, and nodules, though it often has a more chronic and progressive course with systemic symptoms in advanced stages.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on Full Patient Presentation:

1. **Lichen Planus**: The description of violaceous papules and plaques along with chronicity and absence of extracutaneous involvement strongly suggests lichen planus.
2. **Prurigo Nodularis**: Persistent, intensely pruritic, and nodule-forming condition that fits the described presentation.
3. **Erythema Elevatum Diutinum (EED)**: Chronic, erythematous to brownish papules/plaques on extensor surfaces, aligned with the patient's symptoms.
4. **Sarcoidosis**: Chronic violaceous papules and plaques are consistent, though typically associated with systemic involvement.
5. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica**: Chronic plaques on the lower extremities fit the description, especially if there is a history of diabetes.
6. **Granuloma Annulare**: Chronicity and papular nature fit, though the typical annular configuration is not mentioned.
7. **Lupus Erythematosus (Cutaneous)**: Plaques fit, but the absence of sun-exposure worsening and systemic symptoms makes it less likely.
8. **Psoriasis**: While the chronicity and morphology partly fit, the absence of classic silvery scaling makes it less likely.
9. **Dermatomyositis**: Papules and plaques fit, but lack of muscle involvement and other characteristic rashes lowers this likelihood.
10. **Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)**: Plaques fit, but the consistent long-term stability and lack of systemic symptoms make it less likely.

### Final Consideration:
Based on the complete patient history and detailed symptomatology, **Lichen Planus** emerges as the most plausible diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A 13-year-old boy with a history of sports-related blunt trauma to the left eye was referred for evaluation of an asymptomatic, pigmented iris lesion in the left eye. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU, and intraocular pressures were normal in both eyes. Results of slitlamp examination of the right eye were unremarkable. Slitlamp examination of the left eye revealed a round, pigmented lesion measuring 3 × 3 mm in basal dimension and with gravitational shifting within the anterior chamber fluid with patient head tilt (Video). There was no corneal guttatae or edema. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography depicted the lesion in the anterior chamber angle abutting the corneal endothelium and resting on the iris stroma with no internal fluid level and no solid component. Ultrasound biomicroscopy confirmed the lesion to be cystic with a thickness of 1.6 mm. Dilated fundus examination revealed normal findings in both eyes. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Free-floating iris pigment epithelium cyst,"Let's construct a 10-step differential diagnosis for the described case.

**Step 1:** **Iris Cyst**
- A cystic lesion found in the anterior chamber angle, abutting the corneal endothelium and resting on the iris stroma points towards an iris cyst.

**Step 2:** **Nevus of Ota**
- Pigmented lesions in the eye should also consider Nevus of Ota, though it typically involves the sclera but may involve the iris.

**Step 3:** **Melanocytoma**
- This benign tumor of melanocytes can present as a pigmented lesion in the eye.

**Step 4:** **Medulloepithelioma**
- This rare congenital tumor could present similarly but usually has a solid component instead of being cystic.

**Step 5:** **Pigment Dispersion Syndrome**
- An eye condition where pigment granules are dispersed within the anterior chamber, but this doesn’t align well with the observed cyst.

**Step 6:** **Foreign Body**
- Consider if the lesion could be a retained foreign body from trauma, though usually there would be more symptoms or visible signs of trauma.

**Step 7:** **Epithelial Implant**
- Post-traumatic implantation of iris or corneal epithelium within the anterior chamber has to be considered.

**Step 8:** **Oncocytoma**
- Rare tumors of epithelial origin can also be considered given the pigmented presentation.

**Step 9:** **Metastatic Tumor**
- Though less likely without a known primary site of cancer, metastatic disease can involve the iris.

**Step 10:** **Iris Melanoma**
- A primary intraocular melanoma needs to be considered despite being more common in older individuals.

### Ranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Iris Cyst**: Given the cystic appearance on imaging and the specific description.
2. **Melanocytoma**: Given the pigmentation and typical benign nature.
3. **Nevus of Ota**: Due to pigmented lesions, though less typical due to lack of scleral involvement.
4. **Epithelial Implant**: Consideration due to history of trauma.
5. **Iris Melanoma**: Although less likely due to age and lack of solid components.
6. **Medulloepithelioma**: Rare but potentially similar presentation.
7. **Foreign Body**: Less likely given the benign presentation and cystic characteristics.
8. **Pigment Dispersion Syndrome**: Not aligning well with cyst formation but considered due to pigmentation.
9. **Oncocytoma**: Less supportive evidence in this case.
10. **Metastatic Tumor**: Unlikely without systemic indications or symptoms.","['Adolescent Medicine', 'Ophthalmology', 'Sports Medicine', 'Pediatrics']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,13.0,M

### INPUT:
A female patient in her early 50s presented with multiple (approximately 10) bluish, partially keratotic papules and nodules on the lower legs (Figure, A). Since the age of 24 years, the lesions had been growing very slowly in number and size and had been bleeding occasionally after a trauma. The patient used a wheelchair due to a right-sided hemiparesis and hemianopsia caused by an intracranial hemorrhage. At the age of 4 years, recurrent seizures had led to the diagnosis of cerebral venous malformations. Clinical examination also demonstrated a lipolymphedema of the lower legs that had been attributed to a functional venous insufficiency with insufficient venous pump activity. The patient had been wearing compression stockings for years. The family history was positive for cerebral venous malformations involving the patient’s father and aunt, the father having died of an intracranial hemorrhage in his early 70s. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Familial cerebral cavernous malformations,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome:** Given the patient's history of bluish papules and nodules that bleed, and the familial occurrence of vascular anomalies, this rare disorder characterized by multiple venous malformations should be considered.

2. **Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome:** The presence of venous malformations, lymphedema, and a family history of vascular anomalies may suggest this syndrome, which also typically presents with limb hypertrophy.

3. **Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT):** Familial history of vascular anomalies and intracranial hemorrhage could reflect this genetic disorder that involves abnormal blood vessel formation.

4. **Sturge-Weber Syndrome:** Given the hemiparesis and neurological manifestations, this neurocutaneous disorder characterized by facial port-wine stains and linked neurological symptoms can be considered.

5. **Osler-Weber-Rendu Disease:** Another name for Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia but focusing here on the recurrent epistaxis and mucocutaneous telangiectasias while considering congenital vascular malformations in various organs.

6. **Cerebral Cavernous Malformations (CCM):** This condition should be considered given the familial history of cerebral venous malformations and intracranial hemorrhage.

7. **Parkes Weber Syndrome:** This disorder involves arteriovenous malformations and should be considered given the complexity of the patient's vascular background.

8. **Proteus Syndrome:** Considering the slow-growing nature of the lesions and the history of vascular anomalies, this complex disorder of overgrowth can be considered.

9. **Lymphangioma:** Given the description of the lower leg nodules and the history of lymphedema, this benign proliferation of lymphatic vessels could also partially explain the presentation.

10. **Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1):** Although not classic of NF1, considering its diverse manifestations and association with cutaneous and neurological symptoms make it a differential to consider.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis based on All Patient Information:

1. **Cerebral Cavernous Malformations (CCM):** Significant due to the strong familial history of cerebral venous malformations and intracranial hemorrhage.
2. **Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT):** High ranking due to the family history and the manifestation of vascular anomalies in multiple sites.
3. **Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome:** Potential given the cutaneous venous malformations and bleeding tendency of the lesions.
4. **Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome:** Considered because of the combination of venous malformations and lymphedema.
5. **Sturge-Weber Syndrome:** Given the neurological manifestations like hemiparesis and a young onset of seizures.
6. **Osler-Weber-Rendu Disease:** Familial vascular anomalies and the tendency towards hemorrhage, similar to HHT, need consideration.
7. **Parkes Weber Syndrome:** Arteriovenous malformations' involvement makes it relevant in the context.
8. **Proteus Syndrome:** Complex overlapping vascular malformations and overgrowth, though rare.
9. **Lymphangioma:** Due to the association with lymphedema and the physical nature of the described nodules.
10. **Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1):** Added for its potential diverse presentations related to cutaneous nodules and neurological issues.","['Cerebrovascular Disease', 'Dermatology', 'Cutaneous Vascular Malformations', 'Neurology', 'Pediatrics']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,50.0,F

### INPUT:
A 33-year-old man with no prior ocular problems presented to the emergency department in central Florida with a chief complaint of a “pulling and popping” sensation in his left eye that had occurred the previous night. Ophthalmology was consulted to evaluate for a conjunctival foreign body of the left eye. At the time of the examination, his symptoms had resolved; however, he had a photograph from a cellular phone taken during the episode (Figure 1). The photograph shows an irregular, serpiginous extension from beneath the plica semilunaris toward the corneal limbus with localized conjunctival hyperemia. He reported a similar sensation of movement in his left eye that occurred for 1 night about 5 years ago for which he visited an urgent care center where he was diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis. He also reported recent swelling of the left side of his face with associated numbness and occasional swelling of his left hand, all of which resolved after a few days. He had immigrated from Nigeria 10 years prior, had not returned since, and was working as a traveling nurse. A slitlamp examination did not reveal any conjunctival hyperemia, foreign bodies, or other abnormalities like those shown in the photograph. His uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20, extraocular movements were full and without pain or abnormal sensation, and intraocular pressure was normal. His dilated fundus examination was unremarkable. A comprehensive blood cell count revealed mild elevation in the relative (but not absolute) eosinophil count (6.9% reference; 6.0% of white blood cells).

5. **Cysticercosis**
6. **Ocular toxoplasmosis**
7. **Conjunctival granuloma**
8. **Acanthamoeba keratitis**
9. **Sarcoidosis**
10. **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**

### Reranking of Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Loa loa filariasis (Loiasis)**
   - The presentation of a serpiginous movement under the conjunctiva, history of living in a Loa loa-endemic region (Nigeria), and mild eosinophilia points strongly to Loa loa filariasis.
2. **Onchocerciasis**
   - Given the patient's history of living in Nigeria and experiencing migratory symptoms, though typically involves subcutaneous tissues and eyes less distinctly compared to Loa loa.
3. **Allergic conjunctivitis**
   - Previous diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis adds to consideration, but does not fully explain the migratory sensation and photograph findings.
4. **Toxocariasis**
   - The eosinophilia and ocular symptoms fit, though Toxocara more commonly results in granulomas rather than migratory symptoms described.
5. **Cysticercosis**
   - Neurocysticercosis could potentially explain symptoms and mild eosinophilia, but typically not causing visible eye infection.
6. **Ocular toxoplasmosis**
   - Acute presentation, though typically manifests as retinal lesions, it is still a possibility given eye involvement.
7. **Conjunctival granuloma**
   - Fits some symptoms but lacks migratory sensation.
8. **Acanthamoeba keratitis**
   - From being a traveling nurse, exposure to water-based Amoeba should be considered, although keratitis is more typical than the described phenomenon.
9. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Systemic granulomas could involve eye; however, no other systemic symptoms imply otherwise.
10. **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**
    - Autoimmune diseases could present with migratory sensations and mild eosinophilia, yet no strong basis in given information.

Based on the patient's geographic history, symptomatology, and laboratory results, Loa loa filariasis remains the most likely diagnosis.","['Emergency Medicine', 'Global Health', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Ophthalmology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,33.0,M

### INPUT:
A 42-year-old woman with asthma, seasonal allergies, and invasive ductal breast carcinoma presented to the dermatology clinic for rash and poor wound healing 2 weeks after bilateral mastectomy. Five days after surgery, the patient noted erythema, edema, pain, pruritus, and serous fluid drainage at the mastectomy incision sites (Figure 1). Two days later, she developed an erythematous papulovesicular rash on her trunk and upper and lower extremities. A skin swab was sent for bacterial culture, and she was prescribed cefadroxil (500 mg twice daily for 1 week). The skin swab bacterial culture result was negative, and her skin findings did not improve with antibiotics. The patient reported having a similar episode of rash and delayed wound healing after laparoscopy 1 year prior to presentation. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Allergic contact dermatitis due to use of surgical skin glue,"### Differential Diagnosis at Each Step:
1. **Contact Dermatitis**
2. **Eczema Herpeticum**
3. **Surgical Site Infection**
4. **Drug Reaction (e.g., drug-induced dermatitis)**
5. **Herpes Zoster**
6. **Autoimmune Blistering Disease (e.g., Bullous Pemphigoid)**
7. **Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome**
8. **Infective Endocarditis (if considering systemic infection)**
9. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
10. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Contact Dermatitis** 
   - Given the erythema, edema, pain, pruritus, and serous fluid drainage at the surgical sites, a contact allergy to surgical dressings/materials seems plausible.
   
2. **Drug Reaction (e.g., drug-induced dermatitis)**
   - The patient developed skin issues after surgery with antibiotics having no effect, and potentially a reaction to surgical antibiotics or postoperative medications should be considered.

3. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**
   - A history of poor wound healing and development of rash soon after surgery is very indicative. It’s a rare but serious condition that can arise post-surgery.

4. **Autoimmune Blistering Disease (e.g., Bullous Pemphigoid)**
   - An erythematous papulovesicular rash could represent an autoimmune condition, especially given the delay in wound healing and rash extending over the trunk and extremities.

5. **Eczema Herpeticum**
   - Considering her history of skin conditions and the negative bacterial culture, a viral etiology like eczema herpeticum could be a possibility.
   
6. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
   - SLE can present with cutaneous findings and delayed wound healing, though the patient’s history and symptoms do not strongly suggest systemic involvement initially.

7. **Herpes Zoster**
   - Persistent rash with papulovesicular lesions post-surgery could be due to reactivation of herpes zoster, though typically more painful and localized.

8. **Surgical Site Infection**
   - Although bacterial culture was negative, it is still a frequent complication post-surgery, but usually, antibiotics would have shown some effect if this were the primary etiology.

9. **Erythema Multiforme**
   - Might be considered due to rash appearing on trunk and extremities, though less likely given lack of classic target lesions and no history of HSV or other trigger.

10. **Infective Endocarditis**
   - Rare but possible, considering systemic signs like poor wound healing and rash, but no cardiac or bacteremia symptoms reported. Less likely given negative bacterial cultures.","['Dermatology', 'Allergy and Clinical Immunology', ""Women's Health"", 'Breast Cancer', 'Oncology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,42.0,F

### INPUT:
A woman in her 60s with long-standing thickening and induration of the legs presented with 1 week of left leg pain. The patient had previously been diagnosed with elephantiasis nostras verrucosa, and she was advised to elevate and compress the leg but was unavailable for follow-up. Her medical history was notable for morbid obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and stroke. She reported no fever, fatigue, weight changes, gastrointestinal symptoms, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, or hyperhidrosis. Physical examination results revealed multiple firm skin-colored papules and nodules coalescing to form a large plaque on the anterior aspect of the left lower leg, whereas the right lower leg had diffuse induration and hyperpigmentation (Figure 1). There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. Laboratory analysis revealed normal complete blood cell count, thyroid function, serum protein electrophoresis, and serum immunofixation. A biopsy of a left leg nodule was performed. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Euthyroid pretibial mucinosis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Cellulitis** 
   - The patient's reported left leg pain and visible plaque could be indicative of a secondary bacterial infection like cellulitis, particularly considering her history of diabetes.
   
2. **Chronic Venous Insufficiency** 
   - Given the induration and hyperpigmentation of the right lower leg, chronic venous insufficiency might be considered.

3. **Lipedema**
    - Morbid obesity and long-standing leg thickening might suggest a possible diagnosis of lipedema.
   
4. **Erysipelas**
    - Presenting with acute pain and inflammation in the skin makes erysipelas a possible diagnosis.
   
5. **Lymphangiosclerosis**
    - The long-standing nature of her leg condition could indicate lymphangiosclerosis as a differential.

6. **Cutaneous Sarcoidosis**
    - Multiple firm papules and nodules might raise suspicion for cutaneous sarcoidosis.
   
7. **Lymphoma (Cutaneous T-Cell)**
    - Persistent skin changes not responding to previous treatments could point toward a skin condition like cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
   
8. **Kaposi's Sarcoma**
    - The presence of nodules and plaque could be atypical presentations of Kaposi’s sarcoma, especially in an immunocompromised host.
   
9. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans**
    - The nodules and firm plaques might raise the differential of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, a soft tissue sarcoma known to present similarly.

10. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica**
    - Given her diabetes, necrobiosis lipoidica could also be a possibility.

### Re-ranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Cellulitis**
   - Due to the acute onset of pain alongside the chronic condition of the legs, cellulitis remains highly probable, especially given her diabetes which can predispose to infections.
   
2. **Chronic Venous Insufficiency**
   - The clinical picture of induration and hyperpigmentation is typical of chronic venous insufficiency and aligns well with the observed physical examination findings.

3. **Lipedema**
   - The patient's long-standing history of leg thickening and her morbid obesity position lipedema as a solid differential.

4. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica**
   - With the background of diabetes and skin nodules, necrobiosis lipoidica is a possibility to consider.

5. **Lymphangiosclerosis**
   - The chronicity of the condition and symptoms could point toward a structural issue in the lymphatic system such as lymphangiosclerosis.

6. **Lymphoma (Cutaneous T-Cell)**
   - Given the lack of fever and normal laboratory results, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, while less likely than infections or vascular problems, remains a differential because of its typical presentation.

7. **Cutaneous Sarcoidosis**
   - Sarcoidosis could still be considered, although the lack of typical systemic symptoms makes it less likely.

8. **Kaposi's Sarcoma**
   - Considering her age and chronicity, despite no immunosuppression reported, some atypical presentations might be a possibility.

9. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans**
   - Although rare, a history of long-standing nodules and plaque formation should not exclude dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans completely.

10. **Erysipelas**
   - Less likely due to the specific clinical picture presented and the chronic aspects of her disease, yet still within the scope due to the acute pain and potential for an infectious component.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 16-year-old girl presented to our department with a red tumor on her right upper arm that enlarged over 6 months. The lesion initially started as a small cutaneous nodule without obvious triggers that gradually developed and enlarged to form a red-colored tumor with a hard nodule inside. There was no history of local trauma or insect bite. Her personal, past, and family histories were unremarkable. On physical examination, there was a 6 × 6-cm protuberant, thick-walled, and well-defined red bullalike tumor on the right upper arm, which extended 1 to 3 cm from the epidermal surface (Figure, A). Inside the tumor, a nontender, firm-to-hard nodule was palpated. There was no regional lymphadenopathy, and results of the rest of the physical and systemic examinations were normal. Laboratory examinations of hematologic, biochemical, and urinalysis tests were normal. The tumor was excised completely under local anesthesia, and part of the tissue was sent for pathological examination. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Bullous pilomatricoma,"Sure, let's proceed step by step to develop a differential diagnosis.

### Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps
1. **Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP):** A slow-growing, firm nodular tumor that often presents as a protuberant growth, typically on the trunk or proximal extremities.
   
2. **Pyogenic granuloma:** A benign, rapidly growing vascular lesion that presents as a red, shiny, and friable bump, often following minor trauma.
   
3. **Keloid scar:** Overgrowth of granulation tissue at the site of a healed skin injury which is firm, rubbery, and extends beyond the original wound site.
   
4. **Epidermoid cyst:** A common cyst that appears as a firm, subcutaneous nodule, which can become red and painful if inflamed.
   
5. **Mycetoma:** A chronic granulomatous disease characterized by localized swelling, often with multiple sinuses discharging grains.
   
6. **Kaposi sarcoma:** A malignant vascular tumor, often associated with immunosuppression, presenting as red, purple, or brown plaques and nodules.
   
7. **Lymphangioma circumscriptum:** A benign, localized malformation of the lymphatic system presenting as clusters of vesicles on the skin.
   
8. **Hemangiopericytoma:** A rare vascular tumor that appears as a painless, firm, and slow-growing mass.
   
9. **Neurofibroma:** A benign nerve sheath tumor in the peripheral nervous system that presents as a firm nodule.
   
10. **Granuloma annulare:** A benign inflammatory skin condition presenting as ring-shaped or annular plaques.

### Reranking Based on Patient Information and Test Results

Considering the following patient details:
- Slow-growing
- Previously healthy
- No history of trauma or insect bite
- Large, firm, skin-colored to red-colored lesion
- Results of the hematologic, biochemical, and urinalysis tests are normal
- No regional lymphadenopathy
- Findings of rest of physical and systemic examination normal

The most fitting diagnoses can be reranked:

1. **Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP):**
   Fits the description of a slow-growing, firm, protuberant growth on the arm, typical of DFSP.

2. **Hemangiopericytoma:**
   Rare vascular tumor consistent with the presentation of a firm, painless, slow-growing mass.

3. **Epidermoid cyst:**
   Common with firm nodule; however, cysts sometimes become painful or inflamed.

4. **Neurofibroma:**
   Firm, slow-growing nodule but less likely since this usually occurs in the context of neurofibromatosis.

5. **Lymphangioma circumscriptum:**
   Fits with clusters of vesicles, but the presentation with a large, singular tumor is less typical.

6. **Granuloma annulare:**
   Usually presents with annular plaques, does not typically form hard tumors.

7. **Pyogenic granuloma:**
   Rapid growth and red appearance fit, but usually follows trauma, which isn't the case here.

8. **Mycetoma:**
   Typically presents with discharging sinuses, which doesn't match this description.

9. **Kaposi sarcoma:**
   Less likely given absence of immunosuppression and lack of characteristic purple-brown lesions.

10. **Keloid scar:**
   Often extends beyond original wound, but lack of any initial trauma history makes it less likely.","['Pediatrics', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Dermatology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,F

### INPUT:
A 73-year-old man with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and Raynaud disease but no history of cigarette smoking presented to the emergency department with 4 weeks of dysphagia and a 4.54-kg (10-lb) weight loss over 3 months. He had no nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, melena, or hematochezia but reported a cough productive of yellow sputum, dyspnea on exertion, and fatigue. The patient had been treated for presumed pneumonia with 3 courses of azithromycin over the prior 3 months due to infiltrates on a chest radiograph. He reported no known ill contacts or recent travel outside the US. At presentation, his heart rate and blood pressure were normal, and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. Physical examination revealed a maculopapular rash over his neck and chest (Figure, left panel) and bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation.

Antinuclear antibody immunofluorescent assay findings were positive. Results from testing for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C were negative. A barium swallow study showed no visualized aspiration. Endoscopy revealed clean-based esophageal and duodenal ulcers and nonspecific gastritis. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed bibasilar pulmonary consolidations and ground glass opacities (Figure, right panel). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Antisynthetase syndrome,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Polymyositis/Dermatomyositis** - The patient's elevated creatine kinase and aldolase levels, maculopapular rash, and lung involvement point towards an inflammatory myopathy with possible associated interstitial lung disease.

2. **Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)** - Bibasilar crackles and CT findings of ground glass opacities suggest ILD, often associated with autoimmune conditions.

3. **Esophageal Cancer** - Dysphagia and significant weight loss in an elderly patient are concerning for an underlying malignancy.

4. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - Positive ANA and systemic symptoms raise the suspicion for SLE.

5. **Scleroderma (Systemic Sclerosis)** - History of Raynaud disease, positive ANA, and esophageal involvement could suggest this connective tissue disease.

6. **Infectious Pneumonia** - Although previously treated, recurrent cough and sputum production could suggest a persistent or resistant infection.

7. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)** - Long-standing history might explain some of the esophageal findings.

8. **Esophagitis (Infectious or Eosinophilic)** - Esophageal ulcers might be due to infectious agents or eosinophilic infiltration in GERD history.

9. **Aspiration Pneumonia** - Pulmonary findings and compromised swallowing mechanism could suggest recurrent aspiration.

10. **Vasculitis** - Systemic inflammation and multi-organ involvement might be due to a systemic vasculitis.

### Re-ranking based on Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Polymyositis/Dermatomyositis** - Most compelling due to elevated muscle enzymes, rash, and systemic involvement.
2. **Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)** - Supported by chest CT findings and lung auscultation abnormalities.
3. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - Positive ANA and systemic findings fit the profile.
4. **Scleroderma (Systemic Sclerosis)** - Strongly considered due to Raynaud's, positive ANA, and Esophageal involvement.
5. **Esophageal Cancer** - Unexplained weight loss and dysphagia are red flags for malignancy.
6. **Infectious Pneumonia** - Persistent pulmonary symptoms suggest either ongoing or secondary infection.
7. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)** - Relevant due to history but less likely primary etiology given systemic symptoms.
8. **Esophagitis (Infectious or Eosinophilic)** - Less likely than other diagnoses but fits with the esophageal findings.
9. **Aspiration Pneumonia** - Less convincing given lack of aspiration on swallow study.
10. **Vasculitis** - Fits the broad systemic symptoms and raised inflammatory markers but lower on likelihood spectrum than more specific diagnoses above.","['Rheumatology', 'Cardiology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia', 'Pulmonary Medicine']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,73.0,M

### INPUT:
A 15-year-old girl presented with a 2-month history of decreased vision and a dark spot in the central vision in her right eye. She had a history of optometric examinations with no known ocular disease. Visual acuity with correction was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Anterior segment examination of both eyes was unremarkable, and the retina in the left eye appeared normal. In the right eye, there was an area of superior macular whitening with associated intraretinal hemorrhages and exudates. Fluorescein angiography showed abnormally dilated and tortuous retinal vessels, irregular capillary branching patterns, and bulblike telangiectasis with late leakage in the superior macula. Optical coherence tomography showed disorganized and hyperreflective inner retinal thickening (Figure, A) and intraretinal and subretinal fluid in the central macula. On review of systems, the patient noted a long-standing growth on her cheek, which on examination was a 4 × 3-mm exophytic, brownish-red vascular papule (Figure, B), as well as a history of lightly pigmented patches of skin and multiple subungual fibromas on her toes. Systemic blood pressure was normal. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Astrocytic hamartoma (with secondary branch retinal vein occlusion) associated with tuberous sclerosis complex,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps

1. **Retinal Hemangioblastoma:** The presence of telangiectatic and tortuous vessels with macular involvement suggests a vascular lesion.
2. **Coats Disease:** Focal retinal telangiectasia and exudates are characteristic features.
3. **Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP):** Dilated and tortuous retinal vessels could indicate a vascular abnormality.
4. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR):** Could present with subretinal fluid and vision decrease but less likely in this age group.
5. **Eales Disease:** Retinal vascular changes and hemorrhages could signify an inflammatory condition.
6. **Astrocytic Hamartoma:** Intraretinal lesions and exophytic vascular growths have relevance.
7. **Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy (FEVR):** Vessels abnormalities and exudates might be suggestive.
8. **Juvenile Retinoschisis:** Visual decline with retinal abnormalities could be indicative.
9. **Macular Telangiectasia Type 2:** Abnormal capillary branching and late leakage are key signs.
10. **Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC):** Presence of retinal and skin features (papule, subungual fibromas, hypopigmented patches).

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC):** This condition aligns with retinal findings, and systemic manifestations like skin lesions and subungual fibromas.
2. **Astrocytic Hamartoma:** Considering TSC, and astrocytic hamartoma is part of TSC spectrum.
3. **Retinal Hemangioblastoma:** Vascular abnormalities and exudation are consistent but lacking systemic findings matching TSC.
4. **Coats Disease:** Retinal telangiectasia and exudation fit but systemic features do not align.
5. **Macular Telangiectasia Type 2:** Retinal vascular changes fit but systemic features do not fit.
6. **Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy (FEVR):** Retinal findings match but systemic features do not align.
7. **Juvenile Retinoschisis:** Retinal abnormalities can appear similarly but lacks other systemic signs.
8. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR):** Findings of subretinal fluid are fitting but the age and usage systems don't align.
9. **Eales Disease:** Inflammatory retinal disease could explain findings but systemic signs are atypical.
10. **Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP):** Vascular growth anomalies are typical but age and systemic findings do not match.","['Dermatology', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Ophthalmology', 'Macular Diseases', 'Pediatrics']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,15.0,F

### INPUT:
A man in his 80s presented to the dermatology clinic with a 3-month history of a violaceous plaque with blackish papules and nodules on his left cheek, neck, and chest. He reported that the lesion had been asymptomatic but was increasing in size, with progression from his face to anterior chest. He received a diagnosis of primary salivary duct carcinoma of the hard palate 1 year prior and had been receiving treatment with oral bicalutamide and radiotherapy. A partially regressive change of the palatal tumor was noted radiographically during regular follow-up 3 months previously. On clinical examination, a hemorrhagic and erythematous plaque with multiple purpuric-to-blackish infiltrative papules and nodules extending from cheek, lateral neck, to the interclavicular area was found (Figure 1). An incisional biopsy from the infiltrative nodule on cheek was performed and submitted for histopathologic analysis. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Carcinoma hemorrhagiectoides,"Certainly, to proceed with developing a 10-step differential diagnosis, we will take into account the patient's presenting symptoms, medical history, physical examination findings, and the incisional biopsy:

1. **Cutaneous Metastasis from Primary Salivary Duct Carcinoma** - Given the patient's history of salivary duct carcinoma and the rapidly progressive nature of the cutaneous lesions, this is a primary consideration.

2. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma** - A rare and aggressive skin cancer that can present as violaceous nodules and papules, especially in the elderly.

3. **Kaposi Sarcoma** - Known to present as violaceous plaques and nodules, though more commonly associated with immunocompromised states.

4. **Primary Cutaneous Lymphoma** - A type of lymphoma that arises in the skin and can present with infiltrative plaques and nodules.

5. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - Although typically presenting as pearly nodules, basal cell carcinoma can occasionally present with more variegated features.

6. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Another common skin cancer that might present as nodular and infiltrative lesions, particularly in sun-exposed areas.

7. **Melanoma** - Given the color variations and nodular appearance, this is a critical consideration.

8. **Sebaceous Carcinoma** - A rare and aggressive skin cancer that might present on the head and neck, frequently in elderly patients.

9. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans** - A slow-growing tumor that can present as plaque-like structures and sometimes pigmented due to secondary changes.

10. **Infectious Processes such as Blastomycosis or Leishmaniasis** - Some deep fungal infections or parasitic infections can present as nodular and plaque-like lesions on the skin.

### Reranking all 10 Differential Diagnoses Based on Complete Information:

Taking all patient information into account, including the rapid progression, history of salivary duct carcinoma, physical examination findings, and biopsy:

1. **Cutaneous Metastasis from Primary Salivary Duct Carcinoma**
2. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma**
3. **Primary Cutaneous Lymphoma**
4. **Melanoma**
5. **Kaposi Sarcoma**
6. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**
7. **Baseline Cell Carcinoma**
8. **Sebaceous Carcinoma**
9. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans**
10. **Infectious Processes such as Blastomycosis or Leishmaniasis**

### INPUT:
A 56-year-old woman with a history of multiple myeloma complicated by therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia was admitted for myeloablative conditioning in preparation for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. Her course was complicated by severe mucositis, acute kidney injury, and neutropenic fever. During her admission, the patient also developed painful necrotic skin lesions, a nonproductive cough, and altered mental status. Physical examination findings demonstrated dusky, purpuric, and pink papulonodules, some with overlying eschar, scattered on the scalp, neck, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A). Laboratory study results revealed a white blood cell count of 150/μL (reference range, 3500/μL to 10 500/μL), an absolute neutrophil count of 130/μL (reference range, 1500/μL to 7400/μL), and a platelet count of 19 ×103/μL (reference range, 150 ×103/μL to 400 ×103/μL). (To convert the white blood cell and neutrophil counts to cells ×109/L, multiply by 0.001; conversion of the platelet count to cells ×109/L is 1:1.) Blood culture results were negative. The results of a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial infarction, or mass effect. The results of a CT scan of the chest demonstrated multifocal bilateral ground-glass patchy opacities, scattered solid bilateral pulmonary nodules, and a moderately sized pericardial effusion. A biopsy specimen from a skin nodule on the left lateral thigh was obtained for histopathologic examination and tissue culture, and wet mount preparation of a tissue culture colony was performed (Figure, B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Disseminated fusariosis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Invasive Fungal Infection:**
   The patient's immunosuppressed state, necrotic skin lesions, and ground-glass opacities on CT scan suggest this possibility.

2. **Bacterial Sepsis:**
   Considering her neutropenic fever and skin involvement, bacterial sepsis remains a possibility despite negative blood cultures.

3. **Viral Infection:**
   The patient's immunosuppression and altered mental status could be consistent with viral encephalitis or a systemic viral infection.

4. **Leukemia Cutis:**
   Given her known history of acute myeloid leukemia, leukemia cutis could present as nodular skin lesions.

5. **Sweet's Syndrome:**
   Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis can present with fever, nodular skin lesions, and systemic symptoms.

6. **Thrombotic Microangiopathy:**
   Severe mucositis and skin findings could also be part of a thrombotic microangiopathy seen in patients with myeloma or post-chemotherapy.

7. **Disseminated Herpes Zoster:**
   In immunocompromised patients, herpes zoster can disseminate and produce widespread vesicular or necrotic lesions.

8. **Drug Reaction:**
   The patient’s therapy could potentially cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions that mimic necrotic lesions.

9. **Vasculitis:**
   Necrotic skin lesions and systemic involvement could be due to vasculitis.

10. **Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD):**
    Post-transplant patients may develop GVHD, which can affect multiple organs, including the skin.

### Ranked Differential Diagnosis (Considering All Information):

1. **Invasive Fungal Infection:**
   Most likely given the histopathologic findings plus the skin and pulmonary involvement.

2. **Bacterial Sepsis:**
   Despite negative blood cultures, the clinical presentation remains highly suspicious in a neutropenic patient.

3. **Vasculitis:**
   Detailed skin biopsy and system-wide presentation make this a strong candidate.

4. **Leukemia Cutis:**
   Relevant due to her AML history and presenting skin lesions but not most typical histopathologic findings.

5. **Sweet's Syndrome:**
   Compatible with her symptoms and skin manifestations, but less common.

6. **Thrombotic Microangiopathy:**
   Consistent with some blood-related findings and systemic signs.

7. **Disseminated Herpes Zoster:**
   Likely given her immune status but typically different lesion morphology.

8. **Drug Reaction:**
   Potential but less likely without a recent new medication and typical presentation.

9. **Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD):**
   Less likely without a transplant performed, rather commonly expected later post-transplant.

10. **Viral Infection:**
   Less likely based on the presentation and negative CNS findings on imaging.","['Infectious Diseases', 'Skin Infections', 'Dermatology', 'Hematology', 'Oncology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,56.0,F

### INPUT:
A 67-year-old man with thoracolumbar scoliosis, poor mobility, and history of frequent falls presented to the emergency department with 2 months of left shoulder pain, stiffness and reduced range of motion, and numbness and paresthesias in his left upper extremity. Ten years prior to presentation, he underwent surgical decompression for syringomyelia. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of his cervical and thoracic spine performed 2 years prior to presentation revealed a recurrent syrinx extending from C1 to T11, which was not resected because it did not cause symptoms at that time. On physical examination, he had mild tenderness to palpation and reduced range of motion of the left shoulder with abduction and flexion limited to 120° (normal range of motion, 180°). The left scapular muscles were atrophic, and pain and temperature sensation were reduced in his proximal left arm, and dorsal aspect of his left shoulder. His complete blood cell count, serum glucose levels, C-reactive protein levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Results of tests for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody were negative. Left shoulder radiograph showed complete absence of the left humeral head and a well-demarcated smooth osseous margin of the proximal humerus with associated soft tissue swelling and periarticular calcification (Figure 1). A chest radiograph taken 2 years prior revealed a normal left shoulder joint. The patient was hospitalized for further evaluation and treatment.

6. **Adhesive Capsulitis (Frozen Shoulder)**
7. **Osteoarthritis**
8. **Rheumatoid Arthritis**
9. **Traumatic Shoulder Dislocation**
10. **Bone Metastases**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Neuropathic Arthropathy (Charcot Joint)**
   - Given the patient's history of syringomyelia and the significant atrophy and unusual erosion patterns observed in the shoulder joint, neuropathic arthropathy is highly probable. 
   
2. **Cervical Radiculopathy**
   - The patient's history of syringomyelia and a recurrent syrinx potentially affecting the cervical nerve roots could explain the symptoms of pain, numbness, and paresthesias in the left upper extremity.
   
3. **Osteoarthritis**
   - Considering the patient's age and the radiographic evidence of joint changes, osteoarthritis is a viable differential but less likely because it usually doesn't present with rapid joint destruction as seen here.
   
4. **Bone Metastases**
   - Could present with rapid joint destruction and unusual bone radiograph findings, though lack of systemic symptoms and lab findings argue against it.
   
5. **Rotator Cuff Tear**
   - The limitation in range of motion and shoulder pain could be due to a rotator cuff tear, although complete absence of the humeral head is not typical for this condition.
   
6. **Rheumatoid Arthritis**
   - Negative rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody tests, alongside rapid and severe joint destruction, make this less likely.
   
7. **Adhesive Capsulitis (Frozen Shoulder)**
   - Limited range of motion could indicate adhesive capsulitis, though it doesn't usually cause the drastic osseous changes noted.
   
8. **Shoulder Impingement Syndrome**
   - This could explain shoulder pain and limited range of motion, but doesn’t align with the radiographic destruction of the humeral head.
   
9. **Polymyalgia Rheumatica**
   - The patient's age fits the profile, but lack of systemic inflammation markers and specific shoulder joint findings weakens this possibility.
   
10. **Traumatic Shoulder Dislocation**
    - Given the patient's history of falls, this could be considered, but radiographic findings suggest a chronic and erosive process rather than an acute traumatic event.","['Emergency Medicine', 'Neurology', 'Rheumatology', 'Spinal Cord Disorders', 'Radiology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,67.0,M

### INPUT:
A 68-year-old man with a remote history of B-cell lymphoma and active renal cell carcinoma (RCC), receiving cabozantinib therapy, was referred for worsening hazy vision in the right eye after recent outside retinal detachment (RD) repair of the left eye, with pars plana vitrectomy and gas. The patient noted blurry vision started around the time of cabozantinib therapy initiation. Cabozantinib therapy was discontinued for surgery and resumed 3 days later. The referring retina specialist noted vitritis and vasculitis intraoperatively, but the result of vitreous biopsy cytology was negative for malignant cells. At presentation to our institution, the patient was taking oral prednisone, 40 mg/d. His visual acuity was 20/500 OD and hand motions OS, with an intraocular pressure of 18 mm Hg in both eyes. Right eye slitlamp examination results showed pigmented cells in the anterior chamber and lens capsule; the left eye showed prolapsed pigmented vitreous at the pupillary margin. Right eye fundus examination results revealed sheets of pigmented cell and vascular sheathing with optic nerve pallor. The left eye had a poor view, with 90% gas fill. Fluorescein angiography illustrated disc and vessel leakage (predominantly arteriole), capillary dropout, and peripheral nonperfusion in the right eye (Figure 1A) with no view in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography revealed debris at the vitreoretinal interface (Figure 1B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Renal cell carcinoma bilateral ocular metastasis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Cabozantinib-induced uveitis**: Medication-induced inflammation, especially given the temporal relationship with therapy initiation.
2. **Immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated uveitis**: Though the patient is on cabozantinib, similar medications can cause uveitis as an adverse effect.
3. **Lymphoma-associated uveitis**: Remote history of B-cell lymphoma potentially causing ocular involvement.
4. **Renal cell carcinoma metastasis**: Active RCC with possible metastatic spread to the eye.
5. **Secondary intraocular lymphoma**: Similar to lymphoma-associated uveitis but focuses on the intraocular spread.
6. **Posterior scleritis**: Inflammatory condition that could manifest with similar symptoms.
7. **Sarcoidosis**: Granulomatous diseases that affect multiple organ systems including the eye.
8. **Viral retinitis (e.g., CMV retinitis)**: Immunocompromised state potentially leading to opportunistic infections.
9. **Idiopathic anterior uveitis**: Inflammation of the uvea without obvious systemic disease association.
10. **Drug-associated posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)**: Affects the brain and can sometimes manifest with visual symptoms.

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnosis
1. **Cabozantinib-induced uveitis**: The strongest consideration given the temporal relationship, drug properties, and inflammation.
2. **Lymphoma-associated uveitis**: Considering the remote history of B-cell lymphoma, which can affect the eye.
3. **Renal cell carcinoma metastasis**: Active RCC increases the suspicion of malignant spread to the eye.
4. **Immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated uveitis**: Secondary consideration due to medication class effects.
5. **Secondary intraocular lymphoma**: Potential for ocular involvement in secondary spread.
6. **Posterior scleritis**: Possible autoimmune/inflammatory related cause.
7. **Sarcoidosis**: Multisystem effects that could manifest similarly.
8. **Idiopathic anterior uveitis**: Given the presence of anterior chamber cells without a clear systemic cause.
9. **Viral retinitis (e.g., CMV retinitis)**: Less likely but pertinent in immunocompromised states.

### INPUT:
A Chinese woman in her late 20s presented with a 20-year history of progressive skin laxity. In early childhood, she had developed asymptomatic yellowish coalesced papules confined to flexural areas. Subsequently, severe skin sagging occurred on her abdomen with loss of elasticity, then spread extensively with developmental growth. The results of a physical examination showed thick and leathery skinfolds on the neck, axillae, inguinal regions, abdomen, and limbs (Figure, A), with yellowish papules scattered on the dorsal neck. The patient had no extracutaneous involvement and was born to healthy nonconsanguineous parents. However, her younger sister had developed the same skin symptoms. Coagulation-related tests indicated a low clotting activity of factor X (52.2%; reference range, 77%-131%) and a prolonged prothrombin time (12.8 seconds; reference range, 10.4-12.6 seconds). The results of other laboratory investigations were unremarkable. Echocardiographic and fundoscopic examination results were normal. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained from her neck for histopathologic examination (Figure, B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like disorder with coagulation deficiency,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps

1. **Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum (PXE)**: The clinical presentation of yellowish papules in flexural areas and progressive skin laxity are highly suggestive of PXE.
   
2. **Cutis Laxa**: Progressive skin laxity is also seen in cutis laxa, a group of connective tissue disorders.

3. **Elastoderma**: Given the thick and leathery skin described, elastoderma could be considered.
   
4. **Mid-dermal Elastolysis**: This condition can present with skin wrinkling, although it is typically more localized.
   
5. **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS)**: EDS could fit the presentation, although the classical vascular and joint involvement is absent.
   
6. **Buschke-Ollendorff Syndrome**: This presents with connective tissue nevi and could resemble the described skin findings.
   
7. **Diffuse Elastosis**: Involves widespread changes in elastic tissue, though rare.
   
8. **Acrogeria**: Presents with skin changes, though usually affects facial skin and hands more prominently.
   
9. **Marfan Syndrome**: Not primarily a skin disease but may present with skin manifestations and should be considered given its hereditary nature.
   
10. **Lipoid Proteinosis**: Presents with skin and mucosal deposits, less likely but still possible due to systemic symptoms.

### Re-ranked Differential Diagnosis
1. **Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum (PXE)**: Strongly supported by the clinical presentation, family history, and skin biopsy findings typically include fragmented elastic fibers.
   
2. **Cutis Laxa**: Progressive skin laxity and the hereditary component make this a strong candidate.
   
3. **Buschke-Ollendorff Syndrome**: The connective tissue nevi and family history support this diagnosis.
   
4. **Elastoderma**: The leathery skin may fit the findings.
   
5. **Mid-dermal Elastolysis**: Fitting with some of the described skin manifestations, though typically more localized.
   
6. **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS)**: Considered due to skin presentation, despite lack of other typical features.
   
7. **Diffuse Elastosis**: Widespread elastic tissue changes, though not commonly seen.
   
8. **Marfan Syndrome**: Genetic and connective tissue aspects considered, skin findings less typical.
   
9. **Acrogeria**: Skin changes prominent but typically more facial.
   
10. **Lipoid Proteinosis**: Unlikely given the absence of mucosal involvement.

A 15-year-old male presented to the pediatric otolaryngology clinic with dysphagia to solid foods, and dyspnea when lying on the right side that was progressive during 8 months. He denied pain, aspiration, noisy breathing, obstructive episodes, dysphonia, and weight loss. A physical examination revealed fullness in the left oropharynx and left level 3 of the neck. Findings of flexible laryngoscopy showed a submucosal mass in the left oropharynx extending inferiorly into the hypopharynx, obliterating the left pyriform sinus, abutting the base of tongue with hooding over the epiglottis. The supraglottis and glottis were unremarkable. Computed tomography imaging with contrast of the neck revealed a 4.6 × 4.0 × 8.0-cm heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left oropharynx and hypopharynx with cystic components and clear planes separating the mass from the spinal musculature and carotid sheath (Figure 1). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pediatric fibromyxoid soft tissue tumor,"### Differential Diagnosis - Step by Step:

1. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**: A common congenital neck mass that could explain the presence of a cystic component in the described lesion.

2. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**: Another congenital cystic neck mass which can present similarly with a large size and cystic areas.

3. **Rhabdomyosarcoma**: A malignant soft tissue tumor that often presents in children and can manifest as a mass with cystic components.

4. **Lymphangioma**: A benign lymphatic malformation that can present as a cystic mass in the neck region.

5. **Teratoma**: A type of germ cell tumor that can contain various tissue types and often presents with cystic and solid components.

6. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Although more common in adults, it can occasionally present in younger individuals and can involve the oropharynx with solid and cystic areas.

7. **Lymphoma**: A malignancy of lymphatic tissue that can present as a mass in the neck with varying consistency.

8. **Salivary Gland Tumor**: Tumors of the salivary glands (like a pleomorphic adenoma) can present in the oropharyngeal region with cystic and solid components.

9. **Paraganglioma**: A rare neuroendocrine tumor that can present as a heterogeneously enhancing mass in the head and neck region.

10. **Hemangioma**: A vascular tumor that can present with a mix of tissue densities and might be considered in a younger patient.

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnoses (Using all Information and Test Results):

1. **Lymphangioma**: Given the age of the patient, the cystic nature, and the absence of weight loss or systemic symptoms, a benign lymphatic malformation is highly possible.
   
2. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**: Congenital and can present similarly with a large size and multiple cystic areas, fitting the patient's demographic and clinical presentation.

3. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**: Also congenital and common in this age group, though less likely to present so inferiorly without midline features.

4. **Teratoma**: The presence of diverse tissue types within the mass could account for the heterogeneity seen on imaging.

5. **Rhabdomyosarcoma**: A possibility given the age and mass characteristics, though less favored due to the absence of aggressive features on imaging.

6. **Salivary Gland Tumor**: Further down because these are generally less common compared to congenital cysts and tumors in this age group.

7. **Lymphoma**: Possible given the patient's age, however, the lack of systemic symptoms (like weight loss, night sweats) makes it slightly less likely.

8. **Paraganglioma**: Less likely due to rarity and usually associated with vascularity that would be more pronounced diagnostically.

9. **Hemangioma**: Although vascular, the presentation is less typical for a hemangioma, particularly in this anatomical region.

10. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Much less likely due to the patient’s young age and the primary presentation without systemic symptomatology.","['Otolaryngology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia', 'Pediatrics', 'Adolescent Medicine']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his 60s presented to our clinic with a 5-year history of diffuse erythematous, edematous annular plaques (Figure 1); low-grade fevers; and mild leukopenia. The result of a skin biopsy performed 4 years prior was interpreted as subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE). Treatments included hydroxychloroquine, 400 mg/d, for 4 years; mycophenolate mofetil, 1000 mg/d, for 6 months; and oral prednisone tapers, starting at 40 mg/d. Of these, only prednisone appeared to elicit a response. Review of symptoms was negative for fatigue, weight loss, cough, shortness of breath, joint pain, ocular symptoms, mucosal ulcerations, history of blood clots, photosensitivity, pleurisy, urine changes, and diarrhea. Medical history included hypertension, for which he took losartan, and seasonal allergies, for which he used fexofenadine and fluticasone. Laboratory evaluation revealed mild neutropenia and lymphopenia with normal hemoglobin and platelet counts. Antinuclear antibody screening results were negative. The results of a comprehensive metabolic panel, C3, C4, serum protein electrophoresis, serum free light chains, methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, ferritin, copper, zinc, haptoglobin, HIV, hepatitis B and C serologic tests, and rapid plasma reagin were negative. Lactate dehydrogenase was mildly elevated. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated at 41 mm/h. Routine cancer screening was up to date. Therapeutic trials of dapsone and dapsone in combination with colchicine were not effective. 
### OUTPUT:
    ","VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, and somatic) syndrome","1. **Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (SCLE)** – Previous biopsy suggested SCLE; however, the absence of effective response to antimalarials and immunosuppressants requires reconsideration.

2. **Dermatomyositis** – Presents with erythematous plaques and could be associated with mild neutropenia and lymphopenia, although muscle weakness is typically present.

3. **Sarcoidosis** – Can present with cutaneous lesions and systemic symptoms like mild leukopenia; biopsy typically shows noncaseating granulomas.

4. **Lymphoma** – Particularly cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which can present with chronic skin lesions, systemic symptoms, and could account for the leukopenia and elevated LDH.

5. **Drug Reaction** – Considering the extensive medication history, a chronic drug eruption or reaction might be a differential diagnosis.

6. **Chronic Infections** – Infections such as endemic mycoses (e.g. histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis) can present with systemic symptoms and skin involvement.

7. **Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (associated)** – Though this man does not have anemia, his leukopenia might imply an autoimmune process.

8. **Cryoglobulinemia** – Associated with systemic inflammation and skin manifestations.

9. **Early-onset Scleroderma** – Although typically associated with other systemic sclerosis features, its early, isolated cutaneous manifestation might resemble the case described.

10. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** – Erythematous plaques and leukopenia could be indicative of a paraneoplastic process, especially considering his age.

### Reranked Diagnosis Considering All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Lymphoma (Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma)**
   - Explanation: The chronicity and resistance to usual therapies, presence of systemic symptoms, and a mild leukopenia make it a leading candidate.

2. **Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (SCLE)**
   - Explanation: Biopsy supported this, and while treatment response was limited, autoimmune diseases can be challenging and persistent.

3. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Explanation: Systemic symptoms and chronic erythematous plaques along with leukopenia fit the sarcoidosis profile.

4. **Dermatomyositis**
   - Explanation: Despite the absence of muscle weakness, atypical presentations can occur, but less likely due to negative ANA and lack of muscle involvement.

5. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**
   - Explanation: The patient's age and persistence of symptoms, despite routine screenings being up to date, merit consideration of an occult malignancy.

6. **Chronic Infection (Endemic Mycosis)**
   - Explanation: Mimics many systemic inflammatory conditions and should be reconsidered especially in regions where endemic mycoses are common.

7. **Drug Reaction**
   - Explanation: Persistent symptoms despite discontinuation of suspected drugs reduce its likelihood but still plausible.

8. **Cryoglobulinemia**
   - Explanation: Given the chronic and systemic nature of the symptoms, it could be related to vasculitis syndromes.

9. **Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (association)**
   - Explanation: Fits if considering associated systemic autoimmunity.

10. **Early-onset Scleroderma**
    - Explanation: Least likely given his presentation and negative antibody tests, but should not be completely ruled out.",['Dermatology'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,60.0,M

### INPUT:
A woman in her early 40s, gravida 3, para 3, with a history of migraines and recurrent preeclampsia and who was 11 weeks post partum presented with acute pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, and nausea that started several hours after a flight from Florida to New York City. She was noted to have tachycardia (110 beats/min) and hypoxemia (90% receiving room air) with a blood pressure of 106/81 mm Hg. Cardiac, respiratory, and pulse examination results were unremarkable. She denied any clear physical or emotional triggers preceding presentation. Before presentation, the patient reported good health with satisfactory employment-mandated routine physical examinations. She denied a history of smoking, alcohol, or illicit drug use. She was not taking hormonal birth control or hormone therapy. Laboratory values demonstrated a normal complete blood cell count and metabolic panel. Chest radiograph results were unremarkable. A computed tomographic chest scan excluded pulmonary embolism but suggested pulmonary and interstitial edema. Results of an electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with premature ventricular contractions, subcentimeter ST-segment elevation in leads I and aVL and 1-mm ST-segment depression in leads II, III, aVF, and V5 through V6. Initial high-sensitivity troponin was 110 000 ng/mL (to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1). Results of cardiac point-of-care ultrasonography demonstrated a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%, with hypokinesis of the anterolateral and posterior walls. Emergent cardiac catheterization revealed spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) of the left main coronary artery (Figure 1 and Video). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Spontaneous coronary artery dissection of the left main coronary artery,"Sure, let's go through a 10-step differential diagnosis process for this patient's presentation:

1. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)** - given the acute pleuritic chest pain and recent flight, PE is highly suspected, though later ruled out by imaging.
2. **Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)** - elevated troponin and ECG changes support this diagnosis.
3. **Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD)** - confirmed later by cardiac catheterization.
4. **Pericarditis** - chest pain and ST-segment elevation could suggest pericarditis.
5. **Pulmonary Edema** - indicated by the CT scan results but needs a broader cause such as heart failure.
6. **Heart Failure** - suggested by reduced ejection fraction and pulmonary edema.
7. **Postpartum Cardiomyopathy** - a relevant diagnosis given the patient's recent postpartum status.
8. **Aortic Dissection** - could cause chest pain and hypoxia, though less likely without typical related findings.
9. **Severe Anemia** - can present with hypoxia and tachycardia, though ruled out by the normal complete blood cell count.
10. **Pneumothorax** - can cause sudden chest pain and shortness of breath, although this was less likely given the unremarkable chest radiograph.

Now, let's rerank the differential diagnoses based on all patient information and test results:

1. **Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD)** - confirmed by cardiac catheterization.
2. **Postpartum Cardiomyopathy** - given her recent postpartum state and reduced ejection fraction.
3. **Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)** - elevated troponin levels and ECG changes also suggest ischemia.
4. **Pulmonary Edema** - identified on CT scan, but we need to find the root cause.
5. **Heart Failure** - related to reduced left ventricular function.
6. **Pericarditis** - could explain chest pain and ST-segment changes, though less likely after SCAD confirmation.
7. **Aortic Dissection** - less likely but remains in consideration for severe chest pain.
8. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)** - initially high on the list, ruled out by CT scan.
9. **Severe Anemia** - although ruled out by lab results, was a possible non-specific cause.
10. **Pneumothorax** - became less likely after imaging and clinical findings.

The final diagnosis, confirmed by cardiac catheterization, is **Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD)**.","['Acute Coronary Syndromes', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Pregnancy', 'Obstetrics', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,40.0,F

### INPUT:
A 60-year-old Black patient presented to the emergency department with a 2-month history of chest pain and shortness of breath with exertion, 3 months of toe numbness, and unintended weight loss of 8 kg over 6 months. The patient also had a history of lumbar spinal stenosis. On presentation, blood pressure was 104/73 mm Hg; heart rate, 91/min; respiratory rate, 16/min; and oxygen saturation, 96% on room air. Physical examination revealed edema to the mid-calf bilaterally, hypoesthesia below the knees, and ankle plantar flexion strength of 3 of 5 based on the Medical Research Council Scale for muscle strength. Laboratory testing revealed a high-sensitivity troponin level of 52 ng/L (reference, <34 ng/L); brain-type natriuretic peptide, 112 pmol/L (reference, <30 pmol/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 51 U/L (0.85 μkat/L) (reference, 0-35 U/L [0-0.58 μkat/L]); and alanine aminotransferase, 76 U/L (1.27 μkat/L) (reference, 0-45 U/L [0-0.75 μkat/L]). A chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly without pulmonary vascular redistribution or pulmonary edema. An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, left anterior fascicular block, and down-sloping anterolateral ST segments. The patient was admitted to the hospital, where electromyography results included reduced amplitude of peroneal nerve action potentials, consistent with axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities. Coronary angiography showed no coronary atherosclerosis, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Results of serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and serum free light chain testing were normal. A bone scintigraphy scan using technetium Tc 99m–labeled hydroxymethylene diphosphonate demonstrated increased cardiac uptake (Figure). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Variant transthyretin amyloidosis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)**  
   - Asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy observed in cardiac MRI points strongly towards HCM.
   
2. **Amyloidosis**  
   - Increased cardiac uptake on bone scintigraphy scan (technetium Tc 99m–labeled hydroxymethylene diphosphonate).
   
3. **Peripheral artery disease (PAD)**  
   - Numbness of toes, plus history of edema to mid-calf bilaterally, and hypoesthesia below the knees.
   
4. **Chronic heart failure (HF)**  
   - Elevated brain-type natriuretic peptide, cardiomegaly observed on chest radiograph.
   
5. **Spinal stenosis-related neuropathy**  
   - Patient history of lumbar spinal stenosis, hypoesthesia, and muscle weakness in lower extremities.
   
6. **Diabetic neuropathy**  
   - Peripheral neuropathy symptoms (though serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light chain testing were normal).
   
7. **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**  
   - Edema and hypoesthesia could be secondary to electrolyte imbalances.
   
8. **Primary muscular disease (e.g., myopathy)**  
   - Reduced amplitude of peroneal nerve action potentials indicating muscle weakness.
   
9. **Chronic liver disease**  
   - Elevated aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels.
   
10. **Undiagnosed malignancy**  
    - Unintended weight loss of 8 kg over 6 months suggests potential underlying malignancy.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Amyloidosis**  
   - Increased cardiac uptake in bone scintigraphy is highly suggestive, alongside asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and peripheral neuropathy.
   
2. **Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)**  
   - Cardiac MRI with asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
   
3. **Chronic heart failure (HF)**  
   - High BNP levels, cardiomegaly, and left anterior fascicular block on ECG.
   
4. **Peripheral artery disease (PAD)**  
   - Toe numbness, bilateral mid-calf edema, associated hypoesthesia.
   
5. **Primary muscular disease (e.g., myopathy)**  
   - Peripheral nerve action potential reduction indicative of muscle involvement.
   
6. **Spinal stenosis-related neuropathy**  
   - Patient history of lumbar spinal stenosis and corresponding lower extremity symptoms.
   
7. **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**  
   - Cannot be ruled out given edema and potential underlying chronic conditions.
   
8. **Undiagnosed malignancy**  
   - Weight loss over 6 months suggests possible but requires further investigation.
   
9. **Diabetic neuropathy**  
   - Less likely given normal serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light chain tests.

### INPUT:
A 70-year-old man presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of a pruritic exanthem that began on his scalp and face and spread across most of his body over a 2-month period. The patient had no fever, night sweats, fatigue, recent unintentional weight loss, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. He reported no new prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal supplements prior to the onset of the exanthem. He had no history of psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, or other skin disorder, and no recent viral or bacterial infection. On presentation, his temperature was 37.1 °C (98.7 °F); blood pressure, 128/86 mm Hg; heart rate, 110/min; and respiratory rate, 30/min. Physical examination revealed confluent salmon-colored plaques composed of folliculocentric scaly papules across his body with several patches of unaffected skin on his trunk. The patient had waxy, exfoliative scale on the volar aspect of his hands and feet and thickened, onycholytic nails. Severe ectropion prevented complete eyelid closure (Figure). He was referred to the emergency department, where laboratory testing revealed a normal complete blood cell count and normal lactate dehydrogenase level. The patient was admitted to the hospital and was treated with intravenous fluids and daily wet-wrap therapy with topical triamcinolone ointment (0.1%) applied to his trunk, arms, and legs, followed by a layer of warm, damp gauze and dry, cotton pajamas. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Erythrodermic pityriasis rubra pilaris,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Exfoliative Dermatitis** (Due to the widespread involvement of skin and the presence of scaling and inflammation)
2. **Mycosis Fungoides** (Considering chronicity, pruritus, and the presence of plaques)
3. **Seborrheic Dermatitis** (Given the involvement of the scalp and face, although less likely due to extensive spread)
4. **Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris** (Waxy, folliculocentric papules and involvement of volar aspects of hands and feet)
5. **Psoriasis** (Thickened, onycholytic nails and scaly plaques suggest possible psoriasis)
6. **Contact Dermatitis** (Possible due to extensive skin involvement but no specific exposure history)
7. **Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma** (Severe ectropion, chronicity of rash, and characteristic skin findings indicative)
8. **Sarcoidosis** (Nonspecific systemic findings and chronic skin involvement)
9. **Drug-Induced Dermatitis** (No new medications reported, but this should not be completely ruled out)
10. **Pemphigus Vulgaris** (Though less likely with the presentation, notable autoimmune cause of severe skin involvement)

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma** (Given the severity, chronicity, and specific dermatological features such as severe ectropion)
2. **Mycosis Fungoides** (Subtype of CTCL; chronicity, plaques, and pruritus are very characteristic)
3. **Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris** (Folliculocentric scaling and involvement of hands/feet plus nail changes are classic)
4. **Exfoliative Dermatitis** (General appearance and scaling widespread involvement, though usually secondary)
5. **Psoriasis** (Thickened, onycholytic nails and scaly plaques, although scalp involvement is common in psoriasis)
6. **Seborrheic Dermatitis** (Involvement of face and scalp, though less likely for extensive body involvement)
7. **Sarcoidosis** (Chronic skin involvement without systemic signs fits, though not primary)
8. **Drug-Induced Dermatitis** (No new drug history but should remain in consideration due to potential triggers)
9. **Pemphigus Vulgaris** (Autoimmune considerations; however, the presentation isn't typical)
10. **Contact Dermatitis** (Extensive involvement could be due to widespread exposure, but no clear history)

Each step reflects the differential diagnosis by evaluating symptoms, history, and current examination findings.

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old man presented for an evaluation of a lesion on the dorsal tongue. The patient was asymptomatic and unaware of the lesion prior to it being discovered by his dentist. He underwent incisional biopsy at another institution and presented for a second opinion on the diagnosis. Overall, he was in good health with no underlying systemic diseases. Results of the most recent serologic analysis and urinalysis were also reportedly within normal limits. The extraoral examination was unremarkable, with no skin lesions, asymmetry, redness, swelling, or lymphadenopathy observed. The intraoral examination revealed an erythematous denuded area of the midline posterior dorsal tongue, with a central nodular component (Figure 1A). The nodule was firm to palpation and nontender. The remaining oral soft tissue was unremarkable. Because a biopsy specimen was already obtained, blank slides were requested from the aforementioned institution, and staining was performed in house.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:
Given the provided patient information, clinical presentation, and test results, let's reassess and rank the differential diagnoses accordingly:

1. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - The firm, nodular, and non-tender lesion on the dorsal tongue raises significant suspicion, coupled with the fact that squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignancy in the oral cavity.
2. **Erythroplakia** - While very rare, erythroplakia presents as a red patch and can be a premalignant or malignant lesion.
3. **Geographic Tongue (Benign Migratory Glossitis)** - A common benign condition that could present with erythematous areas on the tongue but less likely given the firm nodule.
4. **Median Rhomboid Glossitis** - A condition often associated with a central papillary atrophy of the tongue; more common in middle-aged men and related to candida infection.
5. **Oral Lichen Planus** - A chronic inflammatory condition that can present as white striations, but an erythematous variant exists.
6. **Syphilis** - Can present with mucous patches on the tongue in secondary stages, although less common.
7. **Candidiasis** - Though typically presents with more widespread erythematous or white plaques, localized infection is possible.
8. **Traumatic Ulcer** - Typically presents with an area of ulceration, less consistent with a central nodular component.
9. **Erythema Multiforme** - Usually presents with multiple lesions and a more acute onset, less likely on the tongue.
10. **Amyloidosis** - Systemic condition that can have oral manifestations including nodules, but symptoms would be broader and systemic signs more likely present.

Each step is ranked based on the likelihood given the patient's overall health, absence of systemic diseases, and specific lesion characteristics.","['Otolaryngology', 'Dental Medicine']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,46.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his late 60s was referred to the dermatologic clinic with a 10-day history of fever up to 38.5 °C and tender lesions on the neck and trunk. In the previous month, he had received the first cycle of a chemotherapeutic regimen of ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone to treat a recurrence of IgG-κ multiple myeloma with a 10-year history. Physical examination showed annular erythematous plaques of up to 2 cm in diameter, with violaceous and crusted centers on the neck and trunk. On the right chest, an annular erythematous lesion with 2 zones of color—a central area of purpura and an outer erythematous and edematous ring—was present (Figure, A). Laboratory investigations found pancytopenia: a white blood cell count of 2.3 × 103/μL (reference range, 3.5-9.8 × 103/μL), hemoglobin levels of 12.1 g/dL (reference range, 13.5-17.6 g/dL), platelet count of 29 × 103/μL (reference range, 130-400 × 103μL), and elevated serum C-reactive protein levels of 3.31 mg/dL (reference range, <0.30 mg/dL). Blood culture results were negative. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor analogs had not been prescribed to the patient. Skin biopsy from a lesion on the left chest was performed for histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses (Figure, B-D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Erythema Multiforme** - Characterized by annular erythematous plaques with a central zone, often drug-induced or infection-related.
2. **Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis** - Presents with palpable purpura and is often associated with recent infections or drugs.
3. **Disseminated Herpes Zoster** - Could occur in immunocompromised patients, such as those undergoing chemotherapy, presenting with painful vesicular eruptions.
4. **Sweet's Syndrome (Acute Febrile Neutrophilic Dermatosis)** - Can present with fever, leukocytosis, tender erythematous plaques, and is associated with malignancies like multiple myeloma.
5. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis** - A severe mucocutaneous reaction, usually drug-induced, presenting with widespread epidermal necrosis.
6. **Paraneoplastic Pemphigus** - Associated with malignancies, presenting as painful mucocutaneous blistering and erosions.
7. **Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Septicemia (Ecthyma Gangrenosum)** - Potentially fatal in neutropenic patients, with necrotic, ulcerated lesions.
8. **Calciphylaxis** - Vascular calcification leading to painful skin ulcers, typically associated with underlying renal disease or multiple myeloma.
9. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum** - Presents with painful, rapidly enlarging ulcers, and is often associated with systemic diseases like multiple myeloma.
10. **Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease** - Could occur post-stem cell transplantation, presenting with lichenoid or sclerotic skin changes.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Sweet's Syndrome (Acute Febrile Neutrophilic Dermatosis)** - Given the systemic symptoms (fever), the history of malignancy, and the characteristic skin lesions.
2. **Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis** - Potentially due to recent chemotherapy and presenting with similar skin lesions.
3. **Erythema Multiforme** - Drug-induced reactions can present similarly after starting new medications.
4. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum** - Feasible given the systemic symptoms and significant association with multiple myeloma.
5. **Disseminated Herpes Zoster** - More likely in immunocompromised individuals, though typically presenting with grouped vesicles.
6. **Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Septicemia (Ecthyma Gangrenosum)** - The patient’s immunocompromised state increases susceptibility despite negative blood cultures.
7. **Calciphylaxis** - Possible in multiple myeloma patients, though less common without renal disease history.
8. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis** - The typical severe and widespread skin involvement makes it lower on the list.
9. **Paraneoplastic Pemphigus** - Significant but it often presents with more mucosal involvement.
10. **Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease** - Unlikely without prior stem cell transplantation history.","['Dermatology', 'Hematology', 'Myeloma', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,60.0,M

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old man with no ocular history and a history of stage 3 cutaneous melanoma of the scalp and chronic lymphocytic leukemia was referred for kaleidoscope vision. He received nivolumab (anti–programmed cell death 1 checkpoint inhibitor) 9 months prior, obinutuzumab (B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitor) 3 months later, and 5-mg oral prednisone daily. On presentation, nivolumab and obinutuzumab treatment was complete. His visual acuity was 20/125 OD and 20/50 OS. Ophthalmoscopy revealed bilateral panuveitis with diffuse pigmentary abnormalities. Fluorescein angiography showed diffuse retinal pigment epithelium loss and late staining of the retinal lesions. He received 60 mg of oral prednisone daily for 2 weeks with a planned 10-week taper. However, prednisone was discontinued due to positive Lyme disease exposure 6 weeks later. At this time, the active anterior and vitreous cells had resolved. However, 2 weeks later, visual acuity decreased to count fingers in his right eye and hand motions in the left eye. The anterior and vitreous chambers had grade +0.5 pigmented cells. The ophthalmoscopic examination showed a leopard-spot pattern (Figure 1), and optical coherence tomography showed substantial retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal layer loss. Repeat testing for Treponema pallidum, Lyme disease, and HIV was negative. Results of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit were negative for leukemic infiltration.

1. **Drug-induced Uveitis:** Given the patient’s history of receiving nivolumab and obinutuzumab, drug-induced uveitis appears to be the most likely diagnosis. These drugs are known to cause immune-related adverse effects, including uveitis.
   
2. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease:** VKH is a viable differential due to the presence of bilateral panuveitis, pigmentary changes, and ""leopard spot"" patterns, resembling findings seen in VKH.

3. **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Ocular Involvement:** Although MRI of the brain and orbit was negative for leukemic infiltration, CLL-related panuveitis cannot be entirely ruled out and is supported by the patient's CLL history.

4. **Sarcoidosis:** Sarcoidosis can manifest as panuveitis and should be considered despite the absence of systemic signs typically seen in sarcoidosis.

5. **Acute Zonal Occult Outer Retinopathy (AZOOR):** AZOOR presents with sudden vision loss and demonstrates outer retinal layer involvement, which aligns with OCT findings.

6. **Idiopathic Panuveitis:** If no systemic or drug-related cause is identified, idiopathic panuveitis remains a consideration.

7. **Birdshot Chorioretinopathy:** Although less common, birdshot chorioretinopathy presents with bilateral panuveitis and retinal pigment epithelium changes, mimicking some presented symptoms.

8. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy:** Although less likely considering the overall patient profile, CSC can present with visual disturbances and retinal changes.

9. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis:** Often seen in immunocompromised patients, CMV retinitis could be considered, but negative results for HIV and lack of typical CMV findings make it less probable.

10. **Ocular Melanoma Mets:** Given the history of cutaneous melanoma, metastasis to the eye could have been a differential, but lack of MRI findings lowers this probability.

### INPUT:
A 53-year-old woman presenting with a unilateral mild cortical and nuclear cataract associated with 20/32 visual acuity in her left eye was planning to undergo phacoemulsification. A few days before surgery, she noticed a sudden decrease in her left visual acuity measured at 20/80. Her eye specialist then observed a reverse pupillary block in her left eye and referred the patient to our department. At presentation, no other remarkable medical history was recorded and no precipitating factors identified. Slitlamp examination showed a unilateral deepening of the anterior chamber associated with signs of anterior uveitis (ie, keratic precipitates and severe aqueous flare, 3+) and posterior synechiae between the iris and the lens. In addition, fundus examination revealed an inferior retinal detachment without any associated visible tear. Intraocular pressure was 15 mm Hg in the right eye and 9 mm Hg in the left eye. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography images and fundus photographs of both eyes are shown in Figure 1. 
### OUTPUT:

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis
1. Uveitis (High likelihood due to anterior uveitis signs like keratic precipitates, severe aqueous flare, and posterior synechiae)
2. Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment (Presence of inferior retinal detachment without tear fits well)
3. Posterior Uveitis (Potential contributor due to fundus abnormalities)
4. Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy (Following retinal detachment)
5. Choroidal Detachment (May explain the deep anterior chamber and reverse pupillary block)
6. Neovascular Glaucoma (Possible, but not most likely given the IOP differences)
7. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease (Less likely but can't be ruled out)
8. Lens-Induced Glaucoma (Potential, with nuclear cataract history)
9. Fuchs' Heterochromic Iridocyclitis (Less common but considered due to uveitis)
10. Posner-Schlossman Syndrome (Unusual presentation with aqueous flare and retinal detachment)

### INPUT:
A man in his 80s presented to the emergency department with a 4-week history of progressive weakness and fatigue, with associated development of purple bruiselike lesions on his head. He denied any history of trauma, falls, or occlusive headgear use. His medical history was significant for atrial fibrillation, receiving anticoagulation medication, and heart failure. On physical examination, numerous nontender violaceous plaques were seen on the forehead and scalp of the patient (Figure, A). On full skin examination, nonspecific skin-colored plaques were noted on the chest, and a 1.8 × 2.5-cm erythematous plaque was noted on the left lower back. There was no appreciable lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Peripheral blood test results revealed a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, a platelet count of 68 × 103/μL, a white blood cell count of 2800/μL, and an absolute neutrophil count of 1.0/μL. Lactate dehydrogenase level was 202 U/L. (To convert hemoglobin to g/L, multiply by 10.0; platelets to ×109/L, by 1; white blood cell and neutrophil counts to ×109/L, by 0.001; and lactate dehydrogenase to μkat/L, by 0.0167.) A 4-mm punch biopsy was performed on the erythematous plaque on the left lower back (Figure, B and C).

6. **Lymphoma**
7. **Cutaneous Leukemia**
8. **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation**
9. **Aplastic Anemia**
10. **Vasculitis**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Cutaneous Leukemia**: The presentation of purpuric lesions, low blood counts, and biopsy findings are highly suggestive of a hematological malignancy affecting the skin.
2. **Lymphoma**: Skin involvement and systemic symptoms can occur with certain lymphomas, but the blood count abnormalities fit leukemia better.
3. **Leukemia**: Progressive weakness, fatigue, pancytopenia, and skin lesions in an elderly patient strongly suggest this diagnosis.
4. **Myelodysplastic Syndrome**: Blood count abnormalities are consistent, but the presence of violaceous plaques leans more towards a malignancy like leukemia.
5. **Aplastic Anemia**: Pancytopenia fits, but typically does not present with violaceous plaques.
6. **Thrombocytopenia**: Low platelet count could explain bruising, but doesn’t account for all systemic symptoms and blood test anomalies.
7. **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation**: Possible given systemic involvement and pancytopenia, but other signs like organ failure or clotting abnormalities needed.
8. **Anticoagulant-Induced Hemorrhage**: Given history of anticoagulation, this remains a consideration, but systemic involvement suggests a primary hematologic issue.
9. **Vasculitis**: Could cause skin lesions and systemic symptoms, but blood count anomalies are less consistent.
10. **Senile Purpura**: Common in elderly with thin skin, but doesn’t explain systemic symptoms and blood anomalies.","['Dermatology', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Hematology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,80.0,M

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old woman was seen with left-sided facial weakness and swelling for 2 months. She was diagnosed as having recurrent high-grade serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary and developed these symptoms after cycle 4 of chemotherapy. She was receiving oral antidiabetic agents, and her blood glucose level was 110 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). Physical examination findings were consistent with left lower-motor-neuron type of facial nerve palsy. She was conscious and well oriented, with no other relevant clinical signs or focal neurological deficits. There was no history of prior COVID-19 infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was requested, with clinical suspicion of metastasis in view of mildly elevated CA125 levels. The results of MRI of the brain did not reveal any neuroparenchymal or meningeal lesions. However, both maxillary sinuses showed mucosal thickening, which was intermediate to hypointense on T2-weighted imaging and hypointense on T1-weighted imaging with postcontrast enhancement. Computed tomography sections confirmed bony destruction with foci of remodeling involving the walls of the maxillary sinuses (Figure 1).

7. **Paraneoplastic syndrome** (possible in long-standing cancers)
8. **Nasopharyngeal carcinoma**
9. **Atypical facial pain syndrome**
10. **Facial neuritis**

### Ranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results:
1. **Maxillary sinus carcinoma** (Given bony destruction on CT and mucosal abnormalities on MRI imaging)
2. **Chronic sinusitis with osteomyelitis** (Mucosal thickening and bony changes can be consistent with chronic infection leading to osteomyelitis)
3. **Paraneoplastic syndrome** (Given her history of high-grade ovarian cancer and presents atypically with facial involvement)
4. **Facial neuritis** (Separate from chemotherapy, could explain localized nerve involvement without neuroparenchymal lesions)
5. **Metastatic ovarian cancer** (Should consider even if MRI negative, requires a thorough systemic review)
6. **Nasopharyngeal carcinoma** (Suspicious if considering T2 and T1 weighted hypointense lesions)
7. **Facial nerve palsy secondary to chemotherapy** (Temporal relation but less common without other neurological impairments)
8. **Diabetic mononeuropathy** (Unlikely since blood glucose levels are well-controlled)
9. **Atypical facial pain syndrome** (Less likely given the focal findings on CT)
10. **Bell's palsy** (Only by exclusion as there are more pressing radiologic findings and clinical history suggesting other etiologies)

### INPUT:
A 64-year-old woman presented with diminution of vision, progressive redness, and dull aching pain in the right eye for 8 months. There was no history of trauma. Her medical history was unremarkable. On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity measured 20/60 OD and  20/25 OS. The anterior segment showed dilated corkscrew conjunctival vessels (Figure 1), a shallow anterior chamber in the right eye, and nuclear cataract in both eyes. Pupillary reaction and color vision were normal in both eyes. Intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg by Goldman applanation tonometry in both eyes. Gonioscopy revealed an occludable angle in the right eye without evidence of blood in the Schlemm canal. Both eyes’ extraocular movements were full and free in all directions of gaze. Dilated fundus examination showed a clear vitreous cavity in the right eye, 360° serous choroidal detachment partly obscuring the optic disc nasally (Figure 1), and the fundus in the left eye was unremarkable.

10. **Sarcoidosis**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information
1. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome:**
   - Key Points: Progressive ocular symptoms with serous choroidal detachment, corkscrew conjunctival vessels, and shallow anterior chamber. Fits well, especially in absence of trauma and other systemic signs.
   
2. **Carotid Cavernous Fistula (CCF):**
   - Key Points: Corkscrew conjunctival vessels may indicate AV shunt; however, other systemic or orbital signs like proptosis, pulsatile bruit missing.
   
3. **Chronic Angle-Closure Glaucoma:**
   - Key Points: Occludable angle with sustained symptoms. Less likely due to absence of high intraocular pressure typically expected.
   
4. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease:**
   - Key Points: Serous retinal detachment common. Less likely due to absence of extraocular manifestations such as hearing loss, vitiligo.
   
5. **Choroidal Melanoma:**
   - Key Points: Choroidal detachment common but would likely show a more defined mass or abnormality.
   
6. **Sarcoidosis:**
   - Key Points: Can manifest with granulomatous uveitis but often involves other systemic systems.
   
7. **Scleral Inflammation (Scleritis):**
   - Key Points: Would have more significant pain and other visible scleral inflammation signs.
   
8. **Orbital Varix:**
   - Key Points: Less likely due to rare presentation and lack of positional proptosis.
   
9. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation (Orbital Pseudotumor):**
   - Key Points: Unlikely due to lack of marked pain, proptosis or restricted ocular movements.
   
10. **Choroidal Hemangioma:**
   - Key Points: Presents with detachments but typically identified by characteristic orange-red appearance in fundus examination.

### Final Thoughts:
Uveal Effusion Syndrome presents as the most fitting differential diagnosis based on the progressive ocular symptoms, choroidal detachment, and conjunctival vessel appearance. Further diagnostic workup including imaging (Ultrasound, CT/MRI) and possibly diagnostic testing like fluorescein angiography would be essential in confirming the diagnosis.","['Neurology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Carotid and Intracranial Artery Disease', 'Choroidal Disorders', 'Cerebrovascular Disease']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,64.0,F

### INPUT:
A woman in her late 60s presented to the emergency department after an episode of syncope. She described several other episodes occurring at rest over the past several weeks. She denied palpitations, chest pain, and shortness of breath. She was otherwise in excellent health and not taking any medications. She had no family history of syncope or sudden death. Her vital signs and physical examination were unremarkable. The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) results were normal, but premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) were noted on telemetry. Shortly thereafter, 2 episodes of fast polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT), 30 minutes apart, were recorded, both lasting less than 4 seconds (Figure 1A). A repeat ECG showed PVCs (Figure 1B). Laboratory test results including serum potassium and magnesium as well as 3 serial troponin levels were normal. Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular systolic function without wall motion abnormalities or valvular abnormalities. Coronary angiography showed a 50% stenosis of the left circumflex artery. Instant wave-free ratio across the stenosis was 1.0. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Short-coupled PVCs initiating PVT,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Long QT Syndrome:** Given the polymorphic ventricular tachycardia episodes, it is essential to consider long QT syndrome, a condition that can lead to such arrhythmias.

2. **Brugada Syndrome:** This condition can also present with syncope and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, especially in the presence of a structurally normal heart.

3. **Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT):** Since the episodes occurred at rest, CPVT is another differential, which typically involves arrhythmias triggered by stress or exercise, but can also occur at rest.

4. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC):** This condition involves ventricular arrhythmias and requires further investigation despite normal initial echocardiography.

5. **Idiopathic Ventricular Fibrillation (IVF):** In cases where no structural or other known causes are found, idiopathic VF could be considered.

6. **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS):** Although the coronary angiography showed only moderate stenosis and normal troponins, unstable plaque could still occasionally cause arrhythmias.

7. **Electrolyte Imbalance (e.g., Hypokalemia):** Although initial laboratory tests are normal, episodic fluctuations can sometimes escape detection.

8. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM):** This condition can present without apparent symptoms or significant findings on initial tests, requiring more detailed imaging or genetic testing.

9. **Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW):** This condition can present with arrhythmias including polymorphic VT, requiring careful ECG evaluation possibly with electrophysiological studies.

10. **Drug-Induced Arrhythmia:** Although she’s not on medication, it’s worth considering if there’s an exposure history to over-the-counter drugs, supplements, or illicit substances causing arrhythmia.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Long QT Syndrome** – The presence of polymorphic VT is highly suggestive of this condition, especially with normal coronary and echocardiographic findings.
   
2. **Brugada Syndrome** – Given the episodes occurring at rest and normal heart structure, Brugada is a strong differential diagnosis.
   
3. **Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)** – This remains a consideration due to the nature of episodes, though less likely than LQTS and Brugada given the incident at rest.
   
4. **Idiopathic Ventricular Fibrillation (IVF)** – Due to the lack of findings on all tests thus far, idiopathic causes must be considered.
   
5. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)** – Despite the normal initial imaging, further investigation with MRI could reveal structural anomalies.
   
6. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)** – Given the absence of family history and symptoms, it's less likely but still a consideration.
   
7. **Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW)** – Needs more detailed electrophysiological studies to rule in or out.
   
8. **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)** – With low but present stenosis and symptom profile, less likely.
   
9. **Electrolyte Imbalance** – Initial labs were normal thus less likely.
   
10. **Drug-Induced Arrhythmia** – While unlikely due to lack of history, it’s still worth a second check if any exposure was overlooked.","['Cardiology', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Rhythm Disorders']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,60.0,F

### INPUT:
An 80-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 5-day history of fever and right shoulder pain. His temperature was 37.9 °C (100.2 °F); heart rate, 74/min; and blood pressure, 90/49 mm Hg. He had tenderness to palpation and decreased range of motion of his right shoulder. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 9.6 ×  109/L (reference, 4.0-9.0 × 109/L); C-reactive protein level, 35.6 mg/dL (reference, <0.3 mg/dL), and creatine kinase level, 1036 U/L (17.30 μkat/L) (reference, 60-270 U/L [1.00-4.51 μkat/L]). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an effusion and synovial thickening with enhancement in the right shoulder joint and inflammation in the right subscapularis muscle. Gram stain of the synovial fluid revealed gram-positive cocci in clusters. Intravenous cefazolin therapy was initiated, and he underwent right shoulder joint arthroscopic irrigation, synovectomy, and surgical drainage for subscapularis pyomyositis. Blood and synovial fluid cultures grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and intravenous cefazolin was continued. One week after hospitalization, the patient developed asymptomatic black discoloration of the dorsal surface of his tongue (Figure). He reported no prior lingual discoloration and did not smoke cigarettes, use chewing tobacco or illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Black hairy tongue (lingua villosa nigra),"Let's proceed with a differential diagnosis for the patient's initial presentation, and then re-evaluate based on additional information and test results provided.

### Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Septic Arthritis**: Given the fever, joint pain, and MRI findings of effusion and synovial thickening, septic arthritis is a primary consideration.
2. **Osteomyelitis**: The severe pain and localized tenderness could also suggest a bone infection, potentially secondary to a contiguous infection.
3. **Pyomyositis**: The inflammation in the subscapularis muscle points to a possible muscle infection.
4. **Bursitis**: Inflammation of the bursa adjacent to the shoulder joint could present similarly.
5. **Cellulitis**: Skin infection could present with localized pain and tenderness, though less likely given the depth of involvement per MRI.
6. **Rheumatoid Arthritis**: Although less likely given the acute presentation in an elderly patient, it could still be considered in the differential for joint pain and swelling.
7. **Gout**: Crystal-induced arthritis can cause severe pain and swelling, though it typically affects lower-extremity joints.
8. **Polymyalgia Rheumatica**: This inflammatory disorder often presents with shoulder pain in older adults.
9. **Tendonitis**: The pain and decreased range of motion could be due to inflammation of the tendons.
10. **Malignancy**: A primary or metastatic tumor could present with similar symptoms, especially in an elderly patient.

### Reranking Differential Diagnoses Based on Full Patient Information and Test Results:

Considering the patient’s positive culture for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and the new symptom of black tongue discoloration, the differential diagnoses can be more precisely ranked:

1. **Septic Arthritis**: Confirmed by the growth of Staphylococcus aureus in synovial fluid cultures and MRI findings.
2. **Pyomyositis**: Supported by MRI findings of inflammation in the subscapularis muscle and the subsequent surgical drainage yielding Staphylococcus aureus.
3. **Bursitis**: Still possible but less likely given the findings of direct joint and muscle involvement.
4. **Cellulitis**: Less likely given the depth of infection noted on MRI.
5. **Osteomyelitis**: Needs to be considered despite primary confirmation of septic arthritis, especially if the infection spreads to the bone.
6. **Polymyalgia Rheumatica**: Unlikely given the infectious etiology confirmed by blood and synovial fluid cultures.
7. **Tendonitis**: Unlikely given the primary infectious process involving deeper structures.
8. **Rheumatoid Arthritis**: Unlikely given the acute infectious presentation.
9. **Gout**: Unlikely given the nature of the findings and the infective organism identified.
10. **Malignancy**: Very low on differential given the clear infectious process and absence of other signs suggestive of malignancy. 

The patient's oral discoloration, given its context, suggests a likely benign post-antibiotic culture alteration, possibly **black hairy tongue** due to prolonged antibiotic therapy. 

These steps and the final ranking reflect a structured approach to differential diagnosis, emphasizing the importance of integrating clinical findings with diagnostic test results.","['Dermatology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Rheumatology', 'Dental Medicine', 'Antibiotic Use, Overuse, Resistance, Stewardship']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,80.0,M

### INPUT:
A 72-year-old woman was referred for an eye examination because of visual changes in the left eye. Her medical history was notable for end-stage kidney disease requiring a kidney transplant at age 50 years and a second transplant at age 65 years. She had received her medical care at outside facilities, the records of which were not available. She could not recall being given any precise diagnosis but reported having proteinuria since age 7 years. Her other medical conditions included hyperlipidemia, arterial hypertension, and pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex infection. She was taking tacrolimus, amlodipine, atorvastatin, ethambutol, rifampin, and clarithromycin. Her family history was unremarkable. She had 2 healthy adult children. One year after the first kidney transplant, she noted an inferior visual field defect in the left eye and was diagnosed with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Several years later, she underwent uncomplicated bilateral cataract procedures. Visual acuity with distance correction was 20/25 OD and 20/30 OS. Color vision was 14/14 plates for each eye. There was a left relative afferent pupillary defect. Confrontation visual field was full for the right eye and demonstrated an inferior defect for the left eye. External and slitlamp examinations were notable only for bilateral pseudophakia. Both optic discs were anomalous in appearance, with central excavation in the left eye greater than the right eye (Figure). The remainder of the posterior pole examination, including the retinal vessels, appeared normal in both eyes. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Papillorenal syndrome due to a PAX2 gene variant,"To approach the differential diagnosis systematically for this patient's visual changes, visual field defects, and optic disc anomalies, let's break it down step by step.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Optic Neuropathy**: Considering the history of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), recurrence or another type of optic neuropathy should be considered.
2. **Glaucoma**: The presence of central excavation in the optic discs suggests a possible glaucomatous process.
3. **Drug-Induced Ocular Toxicity**: Medications like ethambutol can cause optic neuropathy, particularly in a patient with a complex medication regimen.
4. **Chronic Kidney Disease-Related Ocular Manifestations**: End-stage renal disease and recurrent kidney transplants can lead to multiple systemic complications affecting the eyes.
5. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**: Though primarily affecting central vision, AMD should be considered given the patient’s age.
6. **Mycobacterium avium complex infection**: This infection can have ocular manifestations, particularly in immunocompromised patients.
7. **Diabetic Retinopathy**: Though not explicitly diagnosed with diabetes, her long-standing history of proteinuria and hypertension could imply a metabolic syndrome or undiagnosed diabetes.
8. **Hypertensive Retinopathy**: Longstanding hypertension can lead to changes in the retina and optic nerve.
9. **Optic Disc Drusen**: Anomalous optic discs with central excavation could suggest the presence of optic disc drusen.
10. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC)**: This condition can cause visual disturbances and changes in the posterior pole of the eye, often associated with corticosteroid use or stress, potentially linked to her chronic treatments.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis with All Information Considered:

1. **Optic Neuropathy (NAION)**: Given the history and similar presentation, another episode or similar pathology seems likely.
2. **Drug-Induced Ocular Toxicity**: Given her medication history, ethambutol toxicity should be closely considered.
3. **Glaucoma**: The observation of central excavation is concerning for glaucoma, especially given her age and the optic disc findings.
4. **Optic Disc Drusen**: Anomalous disc appearance and central excavation strongly suggest optic disc drusen.
5. **Hypertensive Retinopathy**: Chronic hypertension is a significant contributor to retinopathy and optic neuropathies.
6. **Chronic Kidney Disease-Related Ocular Manifestations**: End-stage renal disease can cause various ocular issues, tied closely with her medical history.
7. **Mycobacterium avium Complex Infection**: This remains a pertinent possibility given her diagnosis and treatment.
8. **Diabetic Retinopathy**: Always a consideration in elderly patients with prolonged hypertension and proteinuria history.
9. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**: Though less likely given the symptoms and findings, it can’t be entirely ruled out.
10. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC)**: The least likely but considered given corticosteroid use and potential stress from her chronic illnesses.

1. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) - Given the chronicity, infiltrated plaques, and histopathological examination consistent with CTCL.
2. Mycosis fungoides (a type of CTCL) - Specific subtype of CTCL, consistent with the patient's presentation and histopathology.
3. Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (CBCL) - Another form of lymphoma presenting with similar cutaneous manifestations.
4. Lupus erythematosus (LE) - Autoimmune disease with potential for similar skin findings.
5. Sarcoidosis - Systemic granulomatous disease that can present with cutaneous patches and plaques, although more common with systemic involvement.
6. Granulomatous slack skin (GSS) - Rare variant of CTCL that could present with loosened skin due to granulomas.
7. Morphea - Presents with localized sclerotic, infiltrated plaques, but typically does not have violaceous color.
8. Lichen planus - Presents as purplish plaques, but more common in extremities and mucosal involvement.
9. Annular erythema - Typically presents with less persistent and less infiltrated lesions than described.
10. Granuloma annulare - Characteristic annular configuration which is absent in this patient’s presentation.

This sequencing prioritizes the consideration of lymphoproliferative disorders first, given the prolonged and progressive nature of the lesions without systemic involvement, aligning closely with the clinical and histopathological findings.","['Dermatology', 'Cutaneous Vascular Malformations']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,F

### INPUT:
A 5-year-old girl was referred to ophthalmology care for evaluation of nystagmus. Her medical history included esophageal atresia, small bowel obstruction, mild cognitive impairment, low tone, and increased reflexes. Prenatal history was complicated by insulin-controlled gestational diabetes and polyhydramnios. Her ocular history was notable for eye movement abnormalities since birth. She had no family history of ocular disease. On examination, her visual acuity was 20/150 OU and did not improve with correction (right eye, −1.50 [2.00] × 180; left eye, −1.00 [1.50] × 180). Pupillary responses were normal. Alternating vertical and torsional nystagmus was noted (Figure 1). Specifically, 1 eye was noted to rise and intort while the other would fall and extort, followed by reversal of the vertical and torsional components in the opposite eye (Video). The optic nerve and foveal reflexes were normal in both eyes. Flash visual evoked potential (VEP) demonstrated strong ipsilateral activity of the occipital lobe. Results of a previously obtained brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan were reported as normal. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Achiasma with seesaw nystagmus,"Let's develop a 10-step differential diagnosis for this 5-year-old girl with nystagmus and other related symptoms.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Cerebellar Atrophy**
2. **Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease**
3. **Friedreich’s Ataxia**
4. **Leigh Syndrome**
5. **Ataxia-Telangiectasia**
6. **Alexander Disease**
7. **Niemann-Pick Disease Type C**
8. **Sjogren-Larsson Syndrome**
9. **Retinal Dystrophies**
10. **Congenital Oculomotor Apraxia**

### Re-ranking Based on Patient Information and Test Results:
1. **Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease**:
   - Fits with nystagmus, cognitive impairment, and hypotonia. This X-linked leukodystrophy often presents with nystagmus within the first few months of life. Normal MRI might initially be present in early stages.

2. **Cerebellar Atrophy**:
   - Can cause nystagmus, low muscle tone, and cognitive impairment. However, it would usually show abnormalities on MRI.

3. **Friedreich’s Ataxia**:
   - Progressive ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus. Normal initial MRI possible but Pierece and musculoskeletal deformities common and usually family history is present.

4. **Leigh Syndrome**:
   - Subacute necrotizing encephalomyopathy with nystagmus and hypotonia, but typically would show changes on MRI.

5. **Ataxia-Telangiectasia**:
   - Progressive ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and telangiectasias noted usually before age 5, often with immune deficiencies. MRI might initially be normal.

6. **Niemann-Pick Disease Type C**:
   - Vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, nystagmus, hypotonia, and cognitive decline. MRI might show cerebellar atrophy over time.

7. **Alexander Disease**:
   - Megalencephaly with seizures, spasticity, and psychomotor retardation, often with MRI evidence from early infancy.

8. **Sjogren-Larsson Syndrome**:
   - Ichthyosis, spasticity, and mental retardation with ophthalmic abnormalities. MRI would usually show white matter changes.

9. **Congenital Oculomotor Apraxia**:
   - Defective voluntary horizontal eye movement, head thrusts, and cognitive impairment. MRI typically normal but no nystagmus like described.

10. **Retinal Dystrophies**:
    - Progressive vision loss and possibly nystagmus, but would show retinal abnormalities on examination.

Given this structured assessment, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease is the most fitting differential diagnosis considering the provided patient information and test results.","['Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Pediatrics', 'Ophthalmology', 'Neurology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.0,F

### INPUT:
A 28-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 5-day history of bilateral blurry vision, eye redness, discharge, photophobia, and pain. She also reported rhinorrhea and lethargy. Her medical history included Leber congenital amaurosis treated with voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna; Spark Therapeutics) 8 years ago, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) diagnosed 6 months prior to presentation treated with cytarabine and idarubicin. Her latest chemotherapy was 3 weeks before presentation, and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) was removed 2 weeks ago. A complete blood cell count was ordered, revealing anemia, neutropenia, lymphocytopenia, and monocytopenia in the setting of recent chemotherapy. Blood cultures were drawn, and results were pending at the time of presentation. Her ophthalmic examination showed visual acuity of 20/800 OD and 20/400 OS, decreased from her baseline of 20/200 OU. Intraocular pressures were 37 mm Hg OD and 31 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination revealed chemosis, conjunctival hyperemia, and microcystic corneal edema bilaterally. There were more than 20 cells per high-power field of 1 mm × 1 mm beam, with fibrin bilaterally and 2.5-mm hypopyon in the right eye and 2.7-mm hypopyon in the left eye (Figure 1). Posterior segment examination was limited because of corneal edema and anterior inflammation, but there were no vitreous opacities on B-scan ultrasonography. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Bilateral anterior uveitis with pseudohypopyon in the setting of AML infiltration,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Bacterial Endophthalmitis**  
   Given recent chemotherapy and recent PICC line removal, the patient is immunocompromised and at high risk for bloodstream infections that could seed in the eyes.

2. **Fungal Endophthalmitis**  
   Fungal infections are a concern in immunocompromised patients, particularly following prolonged neutropenia.

3. **Acute Anterior Uveitis**  
   Photophobia, eye pain, and hypopyon are common signs that can be associated with uveitis.

4. **Chemotherapy-related Ocular Toxicity**  
   Chemotherapy agents can cause significant ocular toxicity, including corneal edema and inflammation.

5. **Viral Keratoconjunctivitis**  
   Immunosuppressed patients are highly susceptible to viral infections that can present with redness, pain, and discharge.

6. **Acute Glaucoma**  
   Elevated intraocular pressures can result from secondary causes, such as inflammation, leading to pain and blurred vision.

7. **Leukemic Optic Neuropathy**  
   Though the patient has been treated for leukemia, leukemic cells can occasionally infiltrate the optic nerve and cause vision changes.

8. **Autoimmune-Related Ocular Disease**  
   Rare, but possible in patients with malignancies receiving chemotherapy due to immune dysregulation.

9. **Chemical Conjunctivitis**  
   Exposure to irritants or toxins might lead to significant conjunctival inflammation and corneal edema, although less likely given the clinical context.

10. **Orbital Cellulitis**  
   While less likely due to the absence of proptosis and orbital pain, it remains a differential in a patient with signs of severe eye infection and immunocompromise.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Bacterial Endophthalmitis**  
  The acute presentation in an immunocompromised patient with recent invasive procedures (PICC) strongly suggests a bacterial cause.

2. **Fungal Endophthalmitis**  
  Given the patient's immunocompromised state and ongoing treatment for AML, fungal endophthalmitis remains a significant concern.

3. **Viral Keratoconjunctivitis**  
  The presence of eye redness, photophobia, discharge, and the patient’s immunosuppression makes viral infection a strong contender.

4. **Acute Anterior Uveitis**  
  The typical presentation of uveitis-related symptoms like photophobia and pain elevate its likelihood.

5. **Chemotherapy-related Ocular Toxicity**  
  Given the recent history of chemotherapy, this remains a plausible differential though less likely than the infectious causes above.

6. **Autoimmune-Related Ocular Disease**  
  Possible due to chemotherapy-induced immune dysregulation.

7. **Leukemic Optic Neuropathy**  
  The likelihood is lower without optic nerve involvement but remains a differential in the case of vision changes in a leukemic patient.

8. **Acute Glaucoma**  
  The elevated intraocular pressures suggest this is a consequence of another process rather than a primary condition.

9. **Orbital Cellulitis**  
  Dismissed largely due to the absence of external orbital signs.

10. **Chemical Conjunctivitis**  
  Included as a distant possibility given the absence of clear exposure history and typical clinical signs.","['Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Leukemias']",0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,28.0,F

### INPUT:
A 95-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with 24 hours of abdominal pain, 2 weeks of diarrhea, and 3 months of intermittent abdominal bloating and anorexia. She was a farmer in rural Japan who did not drink alcohol and had been diagnosed with bullous pemphigoid 8 months prior, initially treated with prednisolone (15 mg daily). Her medications at presentation were prednisolone (8 mg daily) and lansoprazole. She had experienced 1 episode of dyspnea on exertion 2 weeks before presentation but reported no fevers, cough, wheeze, nausea or vomiting, hematochezia, or melena. In the emergency department, her temperature was 37.7 °C (99.9 °F); blood pressure, 110/56 mm Hg; heart rate, 125/min; and oxygen saturation, 95% on room air. On physical examination her lungs were clear to auscultation, and her abdomen was diffusely tender to palpation without rebound. Skin examination revealed purpuric macules and small thumbprint-like patches on the upper abdomen and central chest (Figure 1). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Disseminated strongyloidiasis,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Infectious Colitis:** Given the history of diarrhea and abdominal pain, an infectious cause such as bacterial, viral, or parasitic colitis could be considered.
2. **Ischemic Colitis:** The patient's age and presentation with abdominal pain and diarrhea are consistent with ischemic colitis.
3. **Inflammatory Bowel Disease:** Conditions such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, especially in the presence of chronic symptoms.
4. **Medication-Induced Colitis:** The use of prednisolone and lansoprazole could contribute to gastrointestinal issues.
5. **Diverticulitis:** Common in the elderly, presents with symptoms of acute abdominal pain and some features of infection.
6. **Peptic Ulcer Disease:** Though the patient is on lansoprazole, there's a risk of peptic ulcer disease causing abdominal pain.
7. **Small Bowel Obstruction:** Abdominal bloating and intermittent symptoms over months could suggest a partial obstruction.
8. **Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia:** Given her age and diffuse abdominal pain, this chronic condition could be a consideration.
9. **Celiac Disease:** Chronic GI symptoms and malabsorption issues could indicate celiac disease.
10. **Gastrointestinal Malignancy:** Considering the patient's prolonged symptoms, age, and anorexia.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Ischemic Colitis:** Given the acute presentation of abdominal pain, age, and diffuse tenderness without rebound, this remains a high concern.
2. **Medication-Induced Colitis:** The chronic use of prednisolone and lansoprazole could certainly cause gastrointestinal upset.
3. **Gastrointestinal Malignancy:** Chronic symptoms of anorexia and bloating in an elderly patient warrant investigating for malignancy.
4. **Diverticulitis:** Acute abdominal pain and tenderness are consistent, though absence of rebound makes it slightly less likely without imaging.
5. **Peptic Ulcer Disease:** Though less likely with a PPI, it remains a consideration due to abdominal pain.
6. **Infectious Colitis:** Still a possibility but less likely given the chronicity and lack of systemic signs of infection.
7. **Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia:** Chronic course with postprandial pain and weight loss, must be considered especially with risk factors.
8. **Small Bowel Obstruction:** The presentation does not strongly suggest obstruction but should be considered.
9. **Inflammatory Bowel Disease:** Given the chronic nature but typically presents earlier in life.
10. **Celiac Disease:** Unlikely, but should be considered in the differential for chronic diarrhea and bloating.

### INPUT:
A 7-year-old girl was referred to the otolaryngology clinic by her pediatrician for a left pharyngeal lesion. Her parents noted the lesion 18 months prior. It remained stable in size and was asymptomatic. She denied sore throat, dysphagia, and dyspnea. She was otherwise healthy with no history of recurrent pharyngitis. On examination, her vital signs were within normal limits. She was comfortable with no noted stridor and tolerated her oral secretions. Her oropharyngeal examination was notable for size 2+ palatine tonsils without exudate and a white mass on the posterior tonsillar pillar. She did not tolerate palpation of the lesion. There was no palpable cervical adenopathy, and her lungs were clear to auscultation. No laboratory work or imaging were performed. The patient was taken to the operating room for an excisional biopsy. There, a more thorough gross examination of the lesion was notable for a pedunculated, white rubbery mass arising from the left posterior tonsillar pillar with a narrow mucosal stalk (Figure, A). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Hairy pharyngeal polyp,"### Step-wise Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Fibroma**: Given the described pedunculated, rubbery nature of the mass, a benign fibrous growth remains possible.
2. **Squamous Papilloma**: A common benign tumor in the oral cavity that can present as a white, exophytic lesion.
3. **Lymphangioma**: A vascular lesion which can occasionally present in mucosal regions.
4. **Epidermoid Cyst**: While less common in the tonsillar area, epidermoid cysts could appear as white lesions.
5. **Mucocele**: Generally arises in other oral regions but can rarely be found near the tonsillar pillars.
6. **Pyogenic Granuloma**: While typically more erythematous, variation in presentation can sometimes occur.
7. **Tonsillar Hypertrophy**: Specifically extreme cases might present irregularly, although unlikely here.
8. **Keratosis Pharyngis**: A benign condition involving the formation of keratinous debris.
9. **Oral Lichen Planus**: While more common in adults, this chronic illness can present as white patches or plaques.
10. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**: Though typically found in the neck, an anomalous presentation near the tonsillar region is possible.

### Reranking Based on Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Squamous Papilloma**: Most likely given the description, particularly its pedunculated appearance and location.
2. **Fibroma**: Still a strong contender given its benign and rubbery characteristics.
3. **Epidermoid Cyst**: Fits the description and benign nature but less common in this specific location.
4. **Lymphangioma**: Possible given the lesion's long-term stable presentation.
5. **Mucocele**: Rare in this area but possible due to its benign nature and appearance.
6. **Keratosis Pharyngis**: Given the white and painless nature though typically involves more small debris than single mass.
7. **Oral Lichen Planus**: Less likely due to the rare pediatric occurrence but fits white patch presentation.
8. **Pyogenic Granuloma**: Unlikely given the white, rubbery nature rather than erythematous, vascular nature.
9. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**: Uncommon near pillars but worth consideration for completeness.
10. **Tonsillar Hypertrophy**: Least likely as typical hypertrophy does not present in this manner.

Skin examination revealed a 5-mm bright pink, dome-shaped papule with overlying vessels located at the crown of the scalp (Figure, A). There was no purulent discharge or overlying skin changes. A shave skin biopsy was performed and submitted for histopathologic analysis (Figure, B-D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Malignant myopericytoma,"To develop a 10-step differential diagnosis for the given patient, we will consider one diagnosis at each step:

### Initial Differential Diagnoses Step-by-Step:
1. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**
2. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma**
3. **Amelanotic Melanoma**
4. **Sebaceous Carcinoma**
5. **Cutaneous Leishmaniasis**
6. **Keratoacanthoma**
7. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**
8. **Pyogenic Granuloma**
9. **Cutaneous Metastasis**
10. **Kaposi Sarcoma**

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses After Considering Patient Information and Histopathologic Analysis:
1. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma** - Given the rapid growth and appearance of the lesion, coupled with the patient’s age and previous skin cancers, a high suspicion for Merkel Cell Carcinoma is warranted.
2. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)** - Historically common in this patient and can present similarly but less aggressive.
3. **Keratoacanthoma** - Rapidly growing but typically regresses spontaneously; however, it can resemble SCC.
4. **Amelanotic Melanoma** - Given the dome-shaped, vascular nature of the lesion; though less common, should be considered in the differential.
5. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)** - Given the patient's history of multiple SCCs and due to similar presentation.
6. **Cutaneous Metastasis** - Metastatic lesions can present in variable ways and should be considered, particularly with a past cancer history.
7. **Sebaceous Carcinoma** - Uncommon but may present similarly and needs differentiation histologically.
8. **Kaposi Sarcoma** - Less common but differential due to vascular appearance; associated with immunocompromised states.
9. **Cutaneous Leishmaniasis** - Unlikely given geographical considerations but should be excluded based on clinical history.
10. **Pyogenic Granuloma** - Mixed in the differential due to vascularity, though the age and history make it less likely.

### INPUT:
A man in his late 50s was released from a tertiary hospital with an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock with onset 6 days before admission. On admission, vital signs showed blood pressure as 98/66 mm Hg while receiving dobutamine and norepinephrine from the referral hospital, a regular heart rate of 90 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, peripheral oxygen saturation 96% nasal oxygen at 3 L per minute, and a temperature of 36.7° C. Echocardiography showed reduced left ventricle systolic function (estimated ejection fraction, 34%) and hypokinesia of the anteroseptal, anterior, anterolateral, and septal walls. Lung ultrasound demonstrated multiple B-lines in both lung fields. Diagnostic coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion in the left main coronary artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was successful in opening the osteal left main and drug-eluting stents were placed in the left main and left anterior descending arteries. Following PCI, the patient had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Electrical cardioversion was performed and a loading dose of amiodarone was administered. Chest radiography during the loading dose of amiodarone showed infiltrates in both lung fields (Figure 1A). While in the intensive cardiovascular care unit, maintenance doses of amiodarone were continued because of episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, and torsaded de pointes. On the third day of hospitalization, despite adequate diuresis, the chest radiography showed persistent pulmonary edema. Chest computed tomography showed a reticular pattern predominantly in the perihilar area with consolidation and diffuse ground-glass opacity in both lung fields (Figure 1B). In addition, hemodynamic evaluation and lung ultrasound showed no congestion and laboratory markers, including a procalcitonin level of 0.01 ng/mL, and ruled out an infectious etiology. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Acute amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity,"Let's systematically explore differential diagnoses for the patient's condition step by step:

### Differential Diagnosis Steps:
1. **Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity**
2. **Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS)**
3. **Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)**
4. **Pulmonary embolism**
5. **Hypersensitivity pneumonitis**
6. **Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage**
7. **Interstitial lung disease**
8. **Drug-induced lupus**
9. **Viral pneumonitis**
10. **Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease**

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity**: Given the timeline of amiodarone administration and subsequent radiographic findings, amiodarone pulmonary toxicity is likely.
2. **Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS)**: High-priority consideration, especially with massive myocardial infarction and potential for systemic inflammatory response.
3. **Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)**: Persistent pulmonary edema despite no signs of congestion makes HFpEF a less likely but possible consideration.
4. **Pulmonary embolism**: Though less likely given successful PCI and no direct signs suggesting thromboembolism, this remains a concern.
5. **Hypersensitivity pneumonitis**: Could be a differential, considering drug reactions are part of the clinical scenario.
6. **Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage**: Could be reflected as infiltrates on imaging, though patient's presentation makes it less likely.
7. **Interstitial lung disease**: A less likely diagnosis but needs consideration given persistent pulmonary findings.
8. **Drug-induced lupus**: Uncommon but relevant for a patient on multiple medications.
9. **Viral pneumonitis**: Much less likely given the low procalcitonin levels and lack of infective markers.
10. **Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease**: A rare consideration that would cause persistent pulmonary edema, yet less probable without supporting signs.

### Reranked Diagnosis:
Reviewing all information and test results, along with clinical presentation:

1. **Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity**
2. **Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS)**
3. **Pulmonary embolism**
4. **Hypersensitivity pneumonitis**
5. **Interstitial lung disease**
6. **Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage**
7. **Drug-induced lupus**
8. **Viral pneumonitis**
9. **Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)**
10. **Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease**

**Rationale**:
1. **Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity** remains highest due to timing and imaging results.
2. **ARDS** is plausible given the patient's critical cardiac event.
3. **Pulmonary embolism** moved higher due to the risk of thromboembolic events post-myocardial infarction despite anticoagulation.
4. **Hypersensitivity pneumonitis** relevant with the range of medications administered.
5. **Interstitial lung disease** reflects remaining consideration.
6. **Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage**, though less likely, follows due to persistent infiltrates.
7. **Drug-induced lupus** and **viral pneumonitis** are lower priority given laboratory markers.
8. **HFpEF** is less probable without direct evidence post-PCI and adequate diuresis.
9. **Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease** is rare and less supported by available data.

### INPUT:
A patient in their mid-30s with a medical history of deceased donor kidney transplant, cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis, and CMV viremia with documented resistance to foscarnet and ganciclovir (UL97 and UL54 gene mutations) presented with new-onset floaters in both eyes. The patient was taking systemic immunosuppression but recently stopped taking maribavir because of concerns about resistance and was transitioned to cidofovir and CMV immune globulin. On clinical examination, the visual acuity measured 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. Motility, visual fields, and anterior segment examination were normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed tortuous vasculature, multiple cotton wool spots along the arcades and periphery, and granular, hypopigmented retinal lesions without hemorrhage in the macula and temporal periphery in both eyes (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography showed localized areas of full-thickness retinitis (Figure 1B). CMV titers indicated viremia at 2.24 million IU/mL. Despite the patient’s documented UL97 and UL54 mutations, a series of 5 biweekly intravitreal injections of foscarnet and ganciclovir were performed given their vision-threatening lesions. Retinal pathology failed to improve, and the patient eventually refused additional intravitreal therapy because of pain and transiently decreased vision after each injection. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",UL97- and UL54-resistant CMV retinitis,"Given the clinical presentation and background of the patient, let's proceed step by step to develop and rank a differential diagnosis list. 

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis Development:

1. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis**: 
   The patient's medical history of CMV viremia and ocular findings are consistent with CMV retinitis, particularly given the retinal lesions, floaters, and resistance to antiviral treatments.

2. **Progressive Outer Retinal Necrosis (PORN)**:
   Seen primarily in immunocompromised patients and characterized by rapid progression and multiple peripheral retinal lesions.

3. **Acute Retinal Necrosis (ARN)**:
   Typically caused by herpes viruses (HSV, VZV), presents with peripheral retinal necrosis but less common in positive CMV contexts.

4. **HIV-Associated Retinopathy**:
   Given the immunosuppression, other opportunistic infections could be considered; HIV retinopathy might show similar retinal findings.

5. **Toxoplasmosis Retinochoroiditis**:
   Characterized by focal necrotizing retinitis, often with a history of exposure, but less likely given the current treatment history.

6. **Syphilitic Retinitis**:
   Causes a wide range of ocular manifestations, including retinitis, but without specific symptoms or history, it’s lower on the list.

7. **Bartonella Retinitis (Cat Scratch Disease)**:
   Typically younger patients and less common, presents as neuroretinitis but can cause retinitis in immunocompromised settings.

8. **Pan-Uveitis (Idiopathic or Sarcoidosis)**:
   Given the appearance of multiple cotton wool spots and possible systemic connection, granulomatous uveitis could be a differential.

9. **Lymphoma (Primary Intraocular Lymphoma)**:
   Presents with subretinal pigmentation changes and may mimic infectious retinitis in immunocompromised patients.

10. **Drug Toxicity (Cidofovir or Systemic Immunosuppressants)**:
    Rarely, the extensive use of medications like cidofovir in transplanted patients might cause retinal toxicity or necrosis.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis**: 
   Highly likely given the patient's CMV history, clinical findings, and resistance pattern.

2. **Progressive Outer Retinal Necrosis (PORN)**:
   Immunosuppressed state and rapid progression could fit PORN, a close contender.

3. **Acute Retinal Necrosis (ARN)**:
   Significant due to the presence of similar full-thickness retinal changes and possible rapid course.

4. **HIV-Associated Retinopathy**:
   Considerable due to immunocompromised state, even though now less likely due to focused viral pathology.

5. **Toxoplasmosis Retinochoroiditis**:
   Remote possiblility due to clinical retinal findings and systemic immune suppression.

6. **Syphilitic Retinitis**:
   Possible but less likely in absence of relevant systemic findings or specific history.

7. **Bartonella (Cat Scratch Disease)**:
   Uncommon but not impossible in the setting of immune suppression.

8. **Pan-Uveitis (Specific causes like Sarcoidosis)**:
   Lower down in priority but possible if clinical symptoms were broader.

9. **Lymphoma**:

### INPUT:
A 42-year-old man with hypertension, type 2 diabetes diagnosed at age 25 years, and gastroparesis presented to the emergency department with right lower extremity blisters that had developed spontaneously over the prior 36 hours. He reported a tingling sensation in the affected area but no pruritus or pain. He had no history of leg trauma and no chemical or extreme temperature exposure. Medications included insulin lispro (sliding scale 3 times daily) and insulin glargine (20 units nightly). On physical examination, he was afebrile and had normal vital signs. His extremities were warm with palpable distal pulses. Hyperpigmented macules were present on the anterior lower legs below the knees, and tense bullae were present on the anterior aspect of the right lower extremity, dorsal foot surface, and toes (Figure). There was no surrounding erythema or edema, and findings on the remainder of the skin and mucocutaneous examination were unremarkable. Laboratory testing revealed a blood glucose level of 375 mg/dL (20.81 mmol/L) and hemoglobin A1c level of 9.8%. Results of a basic metabolic panel and complete blood cell count were within reference range except for mild anemia (hemoglobin level, 10.9 g/dL).

8. **Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita**
9. **Drug-Induced Bullous Eruption**
10. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:
Considering the patient’s history, physical examination findings, and test results, the differential diagnoses can be reranked based on the most likely conditions first:

1. **Bullous Diabetic Dermopathy**
2. **Porphyria Cutanea Tarda**
3. **Bullous Pemphigoid**
4. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica**
5. **Bullous Systemic Lupus Erythematosus**
6. **Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita**
7. **Infectious Bullous Dermatoses (e.g., Bullous Impetigo)**
8. **Drug-Induced Bullous Eruption**
9. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**
10. **Contact Dermatitis**
  
Let's think step-by-step with patient-specific information:

1. **Bullous Diabetic Dermopathy**
   - **Reason**: Common in diabetics, especially with poor glycemic control. The description fits diabetic dermopathy closely.

2. **Porphyria Cutanea Tarda**
   - **Reason**: The lesions could be consistent with bullae seen in PCT, and diabetes can be a precipitating factor.

3. **Bullous Pemphigoid**
   - **Reason**: Tense bullae are characteristic, and while more common in older adults, it should be considered here.

4. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica**
   - **Reason**: Common in diabetic patients, presents with skin lesions but not typically with bullae as first presentation.

5. **Bullous Systemic Lupus Erythematosus**
   - **Reason**: Bullous lesions possible in lupus, but less common without systemic symptoms.

6. **Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita**
   - **Reason**: Generally less common and would present with different morphological and distribution patterns.

7. **Infectious Bullous Dermatoses (e.g., Bullous Impetigo)**
   - **Reason**: Given no erythema or systemic signs of infection, this is less likely.

8. **Drug-Induced Bullous Eruption**
   - **Reason**: No recent change in medication noted, making it less likely.

9. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**
   - **Reason**: Typically involves mucous membranes which are unremarkable in this case.

10. **Contact Dermatitis**
    - **Reason**: Unlikely without history of new exposure or pruritus.","['Dermatology', 'Diabetes', 'Diabetes and Endocrinology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,42.0,M

### INPUT:
A 61-year-old Black man with hypertension and diabetes presented with decreased vision 3 months after uneventful cataract surgery in his left eye. He had undergone laser retinopexy for retinal tears in his right eye and a scleral buckle and vitrectomy for a retinal detachment in his left eye 1 year earlier. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/40 OD and counting fingers OS. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 14 mm Hg in the right eye and 44 mm Hg in the left eye. Anterior segment examination of the right eye was unremarkable, while ophthalmoscopic examination showed vascular attenuation and treated retinal breaks. In the left eye, microcystic corneal edema and Descemet membrane folds limited examination, but no residual lenticular fragments or neovascularization of the iris or angle were seen. The patient was discharged taking timolol, dorzolamide, brimonidine, and prednisolone. Twelve days later, the cornea had cleared and IOP in the left eye improved to 32 mm Hg. Gonioscopy revealed 360° of anterior synechiae and complete angle closure, which was documented on ultrasound biomicroscopy (Figure 1). The patient started treatment with 500 mg of acetazolamide daily and referred to the glaucoma service for surgical evaluation. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Acute chest syndrome induced by acetazolamide in a patient with previously undiagnosed sickle cell disease.,"Here's a 10-step differential diagnosis for decreased vision and increased intraocular pressure in a 61-year-old man with a complex ocular history:

1. **Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG)**
2. **Neovascular Glaucoma (NVG)**
3. **Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma**
4. **Post-surgical or Traumatic Glaucoma**
5. **Steroid-Induced Glaucoma**
6. **Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma**
7. **Uveitic Glaucoma**
8. **Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma**
9. **Pigmentary Glaucoma**
10. **Lens-Induced Glaucoma**

Now, let's rerank the differential diagnosis using the provided patient information and test results:

1. **Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma** (Most consistent with 360° anterior synechiae and complete angle closure)
2. **Post-surgical or Traumatic Glaucoma** (History of multiple surgeries, including vitrectomy and scleral buckle)
3. **Neovascular Glaucoma (NVG)** (Advanced diabetes and peripheral vascular attenuation; however, no neovascularization seen on examination)
4. **Steroid-Induced Glaucoma** (Patient on prednisolone, although less likely since initial presentation was before steroid use)
5. **Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG)** (Less likely due to angle closure findings)
6. **Uveitic Glaucoma** (Microcystic corneal edema could suggest inflammation, but there's no mention of uveitis)
7. **Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma** (No evidence seen on examination, but possible given the age)
8. **Lens-Induced Glaucoma** (No lenticular fragments seen on examination)
9. **Pigmentary Glaucoma** (Unlikely due to lack of characteristic findings)
10. **Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma** (Chronic nature of symptoms and IOP changes make this less likely) 

By considering the comprehensive patient history, clinical examination, and test results, the list prioritizes conditions like secondary angle-closure glaucoma and post-surgical glaucoma, which align with his clinical scenario.","['Glaucoma', 'Hematology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Sickle Cell Disease', 'Emergency Medicine']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,61.0,M

### INPUT:
A 76-year-old woman presented with a palpable left axillary mass. When she was 36 years old, she underwent a hysterectomy due to abnormal uterine bleeding and was taking estradiol to control postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms for the past 20 years. Bilateral diagnostic mammography revealed a high-density irregular mass in the left axilla with no nodules, architectural distortions, or microcalcifications in the breasts. Ultrasonography of the left breast showed a 4.6-cm lobulated mixed cystic and solid left axillary mass. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed an enhancing 5.2-cm left axillary mass with no breast lesions (Figure 1A). The biopsy examination indicated high-grade adenocarcinoma with papillary features (estrogen receptor– and progesterone receptor–positive, ERBB2 [formerly HER2]–negative, and a high Ki67 index). Positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed only high uptake in the left axilla region. The patient was treated at an outside hospital with neoadjuvant dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, followed by weekly paclitaxel for 10 weeks. She then transferred her care to our center for surgical management. We requested the pathology slides for review at our laboratory and additional immunostaining was performed, which revealed high-grade adenocarcinoma with tumor cells positive for PAX8 (Figure 1B), p53, and WT1 and negative for GATA3. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",High-grade serous carcinoma of gynecological origin,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

**Step 1:** Breast Cancer  
   - Hypothesis: Despite no detectable lesions in the breast, the presumption of an axillary mass often directs thoughts towards metastatic breast cancer. However, the patient’s mass shows distinct features that require further evaluation.

**Step 2:** Ovarian Cancer
   - Hypothesis: The high-grade adenocarcinoma with positivity for WT1 and PAX8 strongly suggests a gynecologic origin, notably ovarian cancer, which commonly expresses these markers.

**Step 3:** Peritoneal Cancer
   - Hypothesis: Primary peritoneal carcinoma can present similarly to ovarian cancer with similar histological markers, despite focusing initially on ovarian origin.

**Step 4:** Fallopian Tube Cancer
   - Hypothesis: Fallopian tube cancer shares many features with ovarian cancer and can express markers like PAX8 and WT1, suggesting it as a differential diagnosis.

**Step 5:** Primary Peritoneal Mesothelioma
   - Hypothesis: This is an unusual primary tumor but can express p53, and PAX8 and could be considered in differential diagnoses related to serous origins.

**Step 6:** Metastatic Uterine Cancer
   - Hypothesis: Given the patient's history of abnormal uterine bleeding and hysterectomy, a metastatic uterine carcinoma must be considered.

**Step 7:** Metastatic Cervical Cancer
   - Hypothesis: Suggestive of its markers and history, another potential differential involves metastatic cervical cancer due to commonality with pelvic origin markers.

**Step 8:** Gastrointestinal Carcinoma
   - Hypothesis: Cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, especially gastric or pancreatic origin can at times show expression of similar markers, even though it’s less typical.

**Step 9:** Thyroid Cancer
   - Hypothesis: Although less probable, some forms of thyroid cancer, like papillary thyroid carcinoma, may show PAX8 positivity and merit consideration.

**Step 10:** Endometrial Cancer
   - Hypothesis: High-grade adenocarcinoma of the endometrium with subsequent metastasis should also be considered, given the histologic features.

### Reranking using Complete Information:

Based on the full diagnostic workup including imaging, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical findings with an emphasis on the elevated markers and PAX8 positivity:

1. **Ovarian Cancer**
2. **Fallopian Tube Cancer**
3. **Primary Peritoneal Cancer**
4. **Metastatic Uterine Cancer**
5. **Endometrial Cancer**
6. **Peritoneal Mesothelioma**
7. **Breast Cancer**
8. **Metastatic Cervical Cancer**
9. **Gastrointestinal Carcinoma**
10. **Thyroid Cancer**

### Conclusion:

The combination of PAX8, WT1 positivity alongside p53, histopathological presentation, and imaging considerably narrows the differential to ovarian or closely related origins such as fallopian tube carcinoma, considering the exclusion of primary breast lesions. The clinical history, immunostaining, and imaging all converge most strongly on an ovarian primary site.","['Oncology', 'Gynecologic Cancer', 'Gynecology', ""Women's Health"", 'Obstetrics and Gynecology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,76.0,F

An 11-year-old girl with no significant medical history was referred to the pediatric otolaryngology department for a painless, left-sided neck mass that had been slowly enlarging for 8 months. On examination, there was an easily palpable 3-cm firm, fixed, well-circumscribed left supraclavicular mass without overlying skin changes or cutaneous involvement. She had no other masses, cervical lymphadenopathy, or systemic symptoms. In workup for this mass, she initially underwent ultrasound imaging, which demonstrated a hypoechoic mass. Findings from fine-needle aspiration and core-needle biopsy were inconclusive, demonstrating histiocytes. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a well-circumscribed mass of mainly soft tissue density with contrast enhancement (Figure 1). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Soft tissue aneurysmal bone cyst,"Certainly! Let's go through a differential diagnosis step-by-step:

2. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** (fixed mass in a child, enhancement on imaging)
3. **Metastatic Neuroblastoma** (considering the age group with soft tissue enhancement)
4. **Branchial Cleft Cyst** (common in neck masses in children)
5. **Reactive Lymphadenopathy** (despite no systemic symptoms, a possibility)
6. **Dermoid Cyst** (less likely due to firmness and enhancement)
7. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst** (typically midline, unlikely location)
8. **Fibromatosis** (borderline rare, fixed nature could fit)
9. **Teratoma** (less likely without evidence on us or needle biopsy)
10. **Lipoma** (usually softer, less likely considering imaging and firmness)

### INPUT:
A 72-year-old male patient presented with 2 days of conjunctival injection in the right eye, chemosis, eyelid edema, and pain with eye movements. His medical history included hypothyroidism, psoriasis, and recent diagnosis of multiple myeloma, and he was taking daratumumab and zoledronic acid. He denied eye trauma, dental surgery, or sinus disease. Examination of the right eye was notable for visual acuity of 20/50, reduced ocular motility in all gazes, proptosis, and chemosis. There was no afferent pupillary defect. Examination of the left eye was unremarkable. Computed tomography of the orbits with contrast demonstrated right preseptal edema and intraorbital fat stranding of the extraconal and intraconal fat without sinus disease. Nasal endoscopy performed by the otolaryngology service showed no evidence of invasive fungal sinusitis. The patient received a single dose of intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone, then was transitioned to ampicillin-sulbactam for presumed orbital cellulitis. After 48 hours, motility, proptosis, and chemosis worsened (Figure 1A). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Zoledronic acid-induced orbital inflammation,"Sure, let's proceed step by step. 

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Orbital Cellulitis**: Given the initial presentation with conjunctival injection, chemosis, eyelid edema, pain with eye movements, reduced ocular motility, and proptosis.
 
2. **Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis**: Given the worsening of motility, proptosis, and chemosis despite antibiotics, and pain with eye movements.

3. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome**: Inflammatory process that could explain unilateral proptosis, ocular motility issues, and severe pain.

4. **Orbital Pseudotumor (Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome)**: Could explain proptosis, chemosis, and pain with eye movements without an infectious etiology.

5. **Thyroid Eye Disease (Graves' Ophthalmopathy)**: Although less likely given the acute presentation, thyroid disease could cause similar findings.

6. **Retrobulbar Hemorrhage**: Could account for the sudden onset of symptoms and worsening condition.

7. **Orbital Tumor/Metastasis**: Given his history of multiple myeloma, potential for metastasis must be considered.

8. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**: Can cause inflammatory changes and orbital involvement.

9. **Sarcoidosis**: Can present with ocular involvement and inflammation.

10. **Lymphoma**: Given the age and presentation, particularly in the context of multiple myeloma, a secondary malignancy could be considered.

### Re-ranking Differential Diagnosis Based on All Information:

1. **Orbital Pseudotumor (Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome)**: Fits with the worsening on antibiotics and absence of systemic illness signs or sinus involvement.
  
2. **Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis**: Worsening symptoms despite appropriate antibiotics and involves ocular motility issues and proptosis.

3. **Orbital Tumor/Metastasis**: History of multiple myeloma makes metastasis to the orbit plausible.

4. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome**: Chronic inflammatory condition presenting similarly.

5. **Lymphoma**: Other potential secondary malignancy, particularly in the context of immune dysfunction due to multiple myeloma.

6. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis**: Possible given the systemic nature and potential for localized ocular inflammation.

7. **Sarcoidosis**: Less likely but still within differential due to systemic inflammatory potential.

8. **Thyroid Eye Disease (Graves' Ophthalmopathy)**: Unlikely given no current hyperthyroid symptoms and acute presentation.

9. **Retrobulbar Hemorrhage**: Less likely given no trauma history and absence of typical findings on CT scan.

10. **Orbital Cellulitis**: Initial working diagnosis, but worsening on appropriate treatment makes it less likely now.

### INPUT:
A 7-year-old boy presented with a slowly growing, asymptomatic lump on his left lower neck since birth. His parents denied any medical history of trauma, infection, or surgery. Physical examination showed a 1.3 × 0.7 × 0.6 cm, yellowish, hump-like mass with hairy surface and cartilage-like consistency on the anterior border of the lower third of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) (Figure, A). No other anomalies were observed. Ultrasonography revealed a 1.2 × 1.0 × 0.9 cm, hypoechoic, avascular, bulging nodule with an anechoic tubular structure extending to the subcutaneous fat and reaching the surface of the muscular layer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a protuberant nodule with diffuse, slight hyperintensity on T1WI; and 2 mild hyperintense foci surrounded by hypointense tissue on fat-suppressed T2WI (Figure, B). The neck mass was completely excised under general anesthesia in the department of pediatric surgery. Intraoperatively, the mass extended into the anteromedial fascia of the left SCM and did not involve the deeper neck structures. Postoperative histopathologic analysis showed normal-appearing epidermis, multiple pilosebaceous follicles, abundant adipose tissue, and 2 centrally circumscribed segments of cartilage in the subcutis (Figure, C). Van Gieson stain highlighted elastic fibers surrounding individual chondrocytes. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cervical chondrocutaneous branchial remnant,"### Initial Differential Diagnoses

1. **Dermoid Cyst**: Given the presence of a lump since birth, a dermoid cyst can be a possibility. These are congenital lesions that contain skin elements.
  
2. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**: This commonly presents as a midline neck mass, which can be considered based on the anatomical location and characteristics.
  
3. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**: These are lateral neck masses that might align with the location and clinical presentation described.
  
4. **Epidermoid Cyst**: A benign lesion that also develops from ectodermal elements, much like a dermoid cyst but without skin adnexa.
  
5. **Lipoma**: A benign fatty tumor that could explain a soft, lump-like mass. However, physical characteristics do not fully match.
  
6. **Fibromatosis Colli**: Typically involving the SCM but more fibrous in nature.
  
7. **Congenital Cartilage Rest Tumor**: Considering the cartilage-like consistency and histological findings, this needs to be considered.
  
8. **Teratoma**: Could potentially include various tissue types, but usually presents as a more complex mass.
  
9. **Infantile Myofibromatosis**: Rare but includes fibrous and fatty components on histology.
  
10. **Sebaceous Nevus (Nevus Sebaceus of Jadassohn)**: Typically presents as a yellowish, hairless plaque, especially on the scalp or face.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses Based on Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Congenital Cartilage Rest Tumor**: Histopathology shows cartilage and adipose tissue, which aligns well.
  
2. **Dermoid Cyst**: Given the presence of multiple pilosebaceous follicles and adipose tissue, this remains a strong contender.
  
3. **Epidermoid Cyst**: Similar to dermoid cyst but lacks pilosebaceous follicles, making it slightly less likely.
  
4. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**: Less likely due to its usual midline location and the inconsistency with cartilage presence.
  
5. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**: Generally does not present with cartilage, reducing its likelihood.
  
6. **Sebaceous Nevus**: While it matches some skin characteristics, it generally doesn't present with cartilage.
  
7. **Fibromatosis Colli**: Typically presents as a fibrous mass without cartilage, hence less likely.
  
8. **Teratoma**: Although it can contain various tissues, its generally more mixed and complex nature makes it less likely.
  
9. **Lipoma**: Would be fully composed of adipose tissue without pilosebaceous elements or cartilage.
  
10. **Infantile Myofibromatosis**: Rare and doesn't typically present with cartilage in histology; thus, less probable.","['Otolaryngology', 'Pediatrics', 'Head and Neck Surgery']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7.0,M

A woman in her late 40s was admitted to the hospital with a 40-year history of multiple hard nodules on the scalp. At 5 years of age, the patient had developed multiple subcutaneous masses in the occipital and bilateral temporal regions. At age 10, she was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis and underwent surgical resection of the tumors at a local hospital. Tumors recurred 5 years after surgery, with their size and number gradually increasing with age. Physical examination revealed scalp masses from 4 to 6 cm in diameter, with hard textures and smooth surfaces (Figure, A), and subcutaneous nodules of 1 × 1 cm to 2 × 2 cm with hard textures on the hands (Figure, B), feet, trunk, and lower extremities. The patient had no tenderness, swelling, or other skin manifestations. The patient had consanguineous parents, but no other family member, including her children, had the disease. 
### OUTPUT:

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)** - Given her early history and previous diagnosis, this remains a high possibility.
2. **Multiple Lipomatosis** - Presents with multiple subcutaneous nodules, often symmetrical and non-tender.
3. **Epidermoid Cysts** - Commonly found on the scalp, can present as nodules.
4. **Gorlin-Goltz Syndrome (Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome)** - Manifests with multiple new tumors over time.
5. **Cowden Syndrome** - Multiple non-cancerous, tumor-like growths, which can include subcutaneous nodules.
6. **Gardner’s Syndrome** - Involves osteomas and epidermoid cysts among other features.
7. **Von Hippel-Lindau Disease** - Although primarily characterized by tumors in multiple organ systems, can present with subcutaneous nodules.
8. **Pachyonychia Congenita** - Rare genetic disorder leading to multiple skin and nail abnormalities.
9. **Tuberous Sclerosis Complex** - Presents with various non-malignant tumors in multiple organs, including skin.
10. **Hereditary Multiple Exostoses** - Characterized by bony growths, often palpable as hard masses under the skin.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on Full Analysis

1. **Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)** - Recurrence of tumors post-surgery, increasing size and number confirms this as the most likely diagnosis.
2. **Cowden Syndrome** - Multiple benign growths, subcutaneous and other tumors fitting with the presentation.
3. **Multiple Lipomatosis** - Multiple non-tender, subcutaneous masses, but hard texture not typical.
4. **Gardner’s Syndrome** - Presence of multiple tumors in various body parts consistent with presentation.
5. **Tuberous Sclerosis Complex** - Fits the general presentation but less likely given the absence of other systemic features.
6. **Von Hippel-Lindau Disease** - Unlikely due to lack of involvement of other organs.
7. **Gorlin-Goltz Syndrome** - Multiple tumors but predominantly cutaneous malignant changes absent.
8. **Epidermoid Cysts** - Common but typically don’t present with the extensive history seen here.
9. **Pachyonychia Congenita** - Rare and less aligned with clinical presentation.
10. **Hereditary Multiple Exostoses** - Hard nodules can fit, but typically related to bone, not soft tissue.

### INPUT:
A woman in her mid-20s was evaluated for a history of dyspnea on exertion for 2 years. On physical examination, her pulse was 70 beats per minute, and blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg. The cardiovascular examination showed a loud S1, normal S2, and an opening snap along with a mid-diastolic, soft, rumbling murmur at the apex of the heart. The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with left atrial enlargement. The echocardiogram showed severe mitral stenosis with a mitral valve area of 0.9 cm2 with a mean (SD) gradient of 20 (4) mm Hg. There was no evidence of any subvalvular thickening, leaflet calcification, or mitral regurgitation. The patient was taken for balloon mitral valvotomy (BMV). A 6F pigtail catheter was placed in the left ventricle via the right femoral artery. The interatrial septum was punctured using a Mullins sheath and Brockenbrough needle via the right femoral vein. Entry into the left atrium was made and confirmed with a dye injection. However, suddenly, the patient developed acute onset of dyspnea along with retrosternal chest pain. Her blood pressure at the time of the event was 100/60 mm Hg, pulse was 70 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation was 96%.

1. **Mitral Stenosis (complicated by the procedure)**
2. **Atrial Septal Defect (iatrogenic due to the procedure)**
3. **Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) due to procedure**
4. **Pulmonary Embolism**
5. **Cardiac Tamponade**

7. **Aortic Dissection**
8. **Pneumothorax (due to procedure)**
9. **Pericarditis**
10. **Tension Pneumothorax (due to complication)**

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on All Information and Test Results:

1. **Cardiac Tamponade**: Given the sudden onset of dyspnea and chest pain after an invasive cardiovascular procedure, and the use of a catheter that could injure heart structures, this must be ruled out urgently.
2. **Acute Mitral Regurgitation (after balloon mitral valvotomy)**: Sudden procedure-related complications like new regurgitation should be ruled out, particularly with sudden symptoms.
3. **Atrial Septal Defect (iatrogenic)**: A septal puncture potentially leading to acute symptoms aligns with the timeline of the event.
4. **Aortic Dissection**: Although less likely, it must be considered given the acute chest pain and potential for procedural complications.
5. **Pulmonary Embolism**: Symptoms are applicable, though less likely without supporting evidence of clot dislodgment or venous thromboembolism (VTE) history.
6. **Pericarditis**: Not as likely given the acute context but should be considered due to post-procedural inflammatory processes.
7. **Pneumothorax**: Common complication but relatively less likely in this specific context due to absence of classic signs.
8. **Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)**: Less likely due to normal sinus rhythm and absence of ischemic changes in ECG.
9. **Tension Pneumothorax**: Unlikely as oxygen saturation is relatively preserved and no immediate sign of tension physiology is present.
10. **Mitral Stenosis (existing condition)**: Less relevant to acute symptom onset but still a primary underlying chronic condition.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 80s initially presented with numerous, primarily photodistributed, crusted, and ulcerated plaques of the trunk and extremities. She had a medical history of essential thrombocytosis (ET), which was treated with hydroxyurea for 14 years, with a total cumulative dose of approximately 2500 g. She was otherwise reasonably well and denied any other constitutional symptoms. The ulcerations had slowly increased in number and size over several years and were quite painful (Figure, A-C). She did have a medical history of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSCa), which had previously been treated surgically. Several tangential shave biopsies were performed to help clarify the patient’s diagnosis. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Hydroxyurea-induced squamous dysplasia,"Sure, let's proceed step by step to form a differential diagnosis and then rank them based on all the provided patient information and test results.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Hydroxyurea-induced skin toxicity**:
   Given the long-term use of hydroxyurea and the characteristic cutaneous manifestations, this could be a primary consideration.

2. **Chronic radiation dermatitis**:
   Historical treatments involving radiation could lead to chronic and delayed skin manifestations similar to the presentation described.

3. **Actinic keratosis**:
   Chronic sun exposure can lead to photodistributed crusted plaques, which is common in elderly patients.

4. **Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)**:
   Ulcerated plaques in sun-exposed areas and a history of NMSCa suggest possible evolution to SCC.

5. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**:
   Given the patient's history of NMSCa, BCC must be considered given its common presentation as ulcerated plaques.

6. **Cutaneous vasculitis**:
   Chronic ulcers could suggest an underlying vasculitis, particularly given the patient's age.

7. **Psoriasis**:
   Psoriasis plaques can occasionally ulcerate due to chronic irritation or secondary infection and given a photodistributed pattern.

8. **Pyoderma gangrenosum**:
   Painful ulcers in an elderly patient with a chronic course could suggest pyoderma gangrenosum.

9. **Martorell hypertensive ischemic leg ulcer**:
   Given her age, painful ulcers could represent ischemic changes particularly prevalent in older populations.

10. **Cutaneous lymphoma**:
    Persistent and progressive skin lesions could suggest a lymphoproliferative disorder despite the lack of other systemic symptoms.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Considering All Information

1. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**:
   Given the ulcerated nature and history of NMSCa, SCC is high on the list.

2. **Hydroxyurea-induced skin toxicity**:
   Long-term hydroxyurea use and characteristic skin manifestations place this as a significant differential.

3. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**:
   History of NMSCa raises the suspicion of another type of skin cancer.

4. **Actinic keratosis**:
   Chronic sun-damaged skin could lead to actinic keratosis, particularly in photodistributed areas.

5. **Cutaneous lymphoma**:
   Persistent and extensive ulcers merit consideration of a possible malignancy like cutaneous lymphoma.

6. **Chronic radiation dermatitis**:
   This is less likely without a clear history of radiation treatment, but remains in consideration.

7. **Psoriasis**:
   Unlikely due to progression to ulceration without identifiable plaques typical of psoriasis.

8. **Cutaneous vasculitis**:
   Although vasculitis can cause ulcers, the patient's presentation doesn't strongly fit this picture.

9. **Pyoderma gangrenosum**:
   The chronicity and painful nature somewhat fit but is less likely without other systemic issues.

10. **Martorell hypertensive ischemic leg ulcer**:
    Least likely considering the location (trunk and extremities broadly rather than localized leg ulcers) and other clinical features.

### INPUT:
A 56-year-old woman presented at the clinic for follow-up of metastatic hormone receptor–positive, ERBB2-negative breast cancer. She had locally advanced disease that was invading the skin overlying her right breast and metastatic disease to the thoracic and lumbar spine, liver, and mediastinal, axillary, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Her disease had progressed after receiving first-line therapy with palbociclib and anastrozole. Subsequent treatments with fulvestrant and paclitaxel were also followed by progressive disease. She received treatment with capecitabine; after 6 weeks of treatment, she developed some redness on her hands and feet that resolved on its own. She then presented to the clinic with pruritic, erythematous, scaly macules and papules on her forearms, faces, chest, and upper back (Figure). The rash had been present for 3 weeks and had recently worsened. Her palms and soles were spared. The rash did not respond to treatment with topical clindamycin, oral solumedrol, or doxycycline. She had a history of substantial sun exposure but no history of skin cancer.

8. **Paraneoplastic Pemphigus**  
9. **Lupus Erythematosus (Subacute Cutaneous)**  
10. **Contact Dermatitis**

### Final Ranked Differential Diagnosis
1. **Capecitabine-induced Hand-Foot Syndrome (HFS)**
2. **Drug-induced Rash (other than HFS)**
3. **Cutaneous Metastasis of Breast Cancer**
4. **Lupus Erythematosus (Subacute Cutaneous)**

6. **Psoriasis**
7. **Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis)**
8. **Paraneoplastic Pemphigus**
9. **Contact Dermatitis**
10. **Seborrheic Dermatitis**

### Clinical Reasoning
1. **Capecitabine-induced Hand-Foot Syndrome (HFS)**
   - This is the most plausible diagnosis given the recent capecitabine treatment and development of erythematous, scaly macules and papules.

2. **Drug-induced Rash (other than HFS)**
   - Considering the extensive treatment history and recent introduction of capecitabine, other forms of drug-induced rash are also highly likely.

3. **Cutaneous Metastasis of Breast Cancer**
   - Despite being less common, cutaneous metastasis must be considered due to the patient’s history of metastatic breast cancer.

4. **Lupus Erythematosus (Subacute Cutaneous)**
   - Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus could present with erythematous, scaly macules and papules, especially in areas exposed to sunlight.

5. **Radiation Dermatitis**
   - If the patient had received radiation therapy previously, radiation dermatitis is a plausible differential.

6. **Psoriasis**
   - Possible due to characteristic erythematous and scaly lesions but less likely given the temporal correlation with chemotherapy.

7. **Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis)**
   - Eczema could present similarly, though the lack of response to typical treatments lowers its probability.

8. **Paraneoplastic Pemphigus**
   - This is considered due to her background of malignancy but is less likely than the other differentials.

9. **Contact Dermatitis**
   - Given her history of substantial sun exposure and the distribution of the rash, contact dermatitis is worth considering, though the lack of response to treatments and no clear contactant lowers its likelihood.

10. **Seborrheic Dermatitis**
   - This is the least likely due to its usual presentation and locations that are not described in this case.","['Dermatology', 'Cutaneous Drug Reactions', 'Breast Cancer', 'Oncology', ""Women's Health""]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,56.0,F

### INPUT:
An 81-year-old woman was referred to our service for assessment of 3 darkly pigmented corneal lesions (Figure 1A). Two years ago, she underwent uncomplicated right cataract surgery at a different center. Her postoperative course had been complicated by persistent low-grade anterior uveitis for which she received maintenance loteprednol, 0.5%, eye drops on alternate days. She also used latanoprost eye drops at night in both eyes for primary open-angle glaucoma. Her medical history was only significant for hypertension, which was well controlled with ramipril. She denied any ocular trauma or recent travel outside of the country. Review of systems was unremarkable. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Dematiaceous fungal keratitis,"Sure, let's break down a 10-step differential diagnosis considering the provided patient information:

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Pigmented keratopathy**: This condition involves deposits on the corneal surface that could be linked to her medication history and ocular surgical history.

2. **Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis**: Associated with low-grade anterior uveitis and could potentially present with pigmented lesions on the cornea.

3. **Intraocular Foreign Body**: Post-surgical complications might include remnants from the cataract surgery.

4. **Melanoma/Primary ocular melanoma**: A dark pigmented lesion could raise suspicion for melanoma, although rarer in the cornea.

5. **Drug-induced pigmentation**: Long-term use of drugs like latanoprost, which is known to cause pigmentation changes, might be responsible for the pigmented corneal lesions.

6. **Endogenous Endophthalmitis**: Potential, though less likely without signs of infection, that could exhibit pigmented deposits in severe chronic cases.

7. **Iris Pigment Dispersion Syndrome**: Often presents with pigment dispersion that could settle on structures including the cornea.

8. **Corneal Nevus**: A benign pigmented lesion that could appear anywhere on the cornea.

9. **Previous ocular trauma with hemosiderosis**: Although she denies a history of trauma, it’s still within the realm of possibility and needs ruling out.

10. **Pigmented Medulloepithelioma**: A rare but serious condition that may present with pigmented lesions.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using Complete Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Drug-induced pigmentation**: Given her history of prolonged latanoprost use and postoperative maintenance loteprednol, this becomes the leading hypothesis.
2. **Pigmented keratopathy**: The timeline and association with previous cataract surgery support this possibility.
3. **Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis**: Given her persistent low-grade anterior uveitis.
4. **Intraocular Foreign Body**: Surgical history raises this as a potential risk.
5. **Iris Pigment Dispersion Syndrome**: Could align with anterior uveitis and pigmented deposits.
6. **Melanoma/Primary ocular melanoma**: Always a concern with new pigmented lesions despite it being rare on the cornea.
7. **Corneal Nevus**: Benign but needs differentiation.
8. **Endogenous Endophthalmitis**: Less likely in the absence of systemic infection signs.
9. **Previous ocular trauma with hemosiderosis**: Less likely according to the patient history.
10. **Pigmented Medulloepithelioma**: Very rare but not impossible, needs ruling out if other common causes are excluded.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 60s presented for evaluation of a new pruritic rash. The rash initially developed on the patient’s legs 13 days before presentation and subsequently progressed to her feet, arms, hands, and trunk. Associated symptoms included a burning sensation and occasional pain. Her medical history was notable for endometrial adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy and recent postoperative radiotherapy (total of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractioned doses), which was completed 4 days after the onset of the rash. She denied any new medications or exposure to chemotherapy, imaging with intravenous contrast, or recent travel. The remainder of her review of systems was unremarkable. On physical examination, there were numerous erythematous edematous coalescing papules and plaques on the upper and lower extremities and scattered erythematous papules and plaques on the back and buttocks (Figure, A). Some plaques were annular and polycyclic in configuration, with central hyperpigmentation (Figure, B). Her chest, abdomen, face, and oral mucosa were clear. A complete blood cell count was notable for an eosinophilia of 11%, with an absolute cell count of 0.80 ×103/uL. Results from a comprehensive metabolic panel were normal. A biopsy was performed on her right thigh for histopathological examination.

7. **Contact Dermatitis**  
8. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**  
9. **Drug Eruption**  
10. **Autoimmune Progesterone Dermatitis**

### Reranking Using Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Radiation Dermatitis** – Given the temporal relationship between the recent completion of radiotherapy and the onset of the rash, radiation dermatitis is highly probable.
   
2. **Drug Eruption** – Despite no new medications being reported, drug eruptions can sometimes be delayed and linked to previous drug exposure; however, the absence of new medications makes it less likely than radiation dermatitis.
   
3. **Dermatitis Herpetiformis** – The described rash distribution and associated symptoms like pruritus are suggestive of dermatitis herpetiformis, though histopathological examination would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
   
4. **Contact Dermatitis** – Though a clear source is not identified, secondary contact reactions can occur, and the presentation aligns with some aspects of contact dermatitis.
   
5. **Erythema Multiforme** – Considered due to the polycyclic lesions and eosinophilia, but generally has a more distinctive target-like appearance.
   
6. **Lichen Planus** – The appearance of plaques, especially on the extremities and trunk, could align with lichen planus, yet some characteristics, like the burning sensation, are not classical.
   
7. **Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus** – The rash could mimic lupus rash morphology but typically involves more sun-exposed areas, which were spared in this patient.
   
8. **Bullous Pemphigoid** – While the presentation of papules and plaques aligns with bullous pemphigoid, blister formation is usually noted, which is not described here.
   
9. **Autoimmune Progesterone Dermatitis** – Considered based on the polycyclic plaques and pruritus, though less likely given the atypical timing and association with menstrual cycles rather than radiotherapy.
   
10. **Pemphigus Vulgaris** – The severity and presentation depicted do not strongly support pemphigus vulgaris; typically, it presents with more severe mucocutaneous blisters.

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy woman in her 30s presented with a painful bruise on her hand that initially appeared a few days after she sustained a twisting injury to the affected hand while participating in acroyoga 2 years before. Since the initial onset, the bruise and pain had persisted despite icing and resting the area. She denied any personal or family history of bleeding disorders. On examination, an ill-defined indurated blue-green plaque was noted on the dorsum of the left hand (Figure 1). Radiography results showed soft tissue swelling but were otherwise unremarkable. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging showed a heterogeneously fluid hyperintense and T1 heterogeneously hyperintense lesion measuring approximately 1.6 × 0.5 × 2.9 cm that was centered within the dorsal subcutaneous soft tissue of the hand. An excision was performed. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor,"Based on the provided patient presentation, imaging, and initial examination, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis process:

### Differential Diagnosis Steps

1. **Hematoma**: Due to the bruise and history of trauma.
2. **Ganglion Cyst**: Common in the hand and could present with soft tissue swelling.
3. **Superficial Thrombophlebitis**: Indurated plaque and pain could suggest inflammation of superficial veins.
4. **Soft Tissue Sarcoma**: Rare, but should be considered given persistent painless mass.
5. **Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis**: Can present with joint swelling and a palpable mass.
6. **Giant Cell Tumor of Tendon Sheath**: Typically presents with a firm, localized swelling.
7. **Granuloma Annulare**: Presents as a dermal papule or plaque, often mistaken for other conditions.
8. **Frostbite sequelae**: Chronic induration and discoloration might suggest previous cold injury.
9. **Vascular Malformation**: Could explain the painful blue-green plaque.
10. **Fibromatosis (Desmoid Tumor)**: Presents with a firm mass that can mimic many other diagnoses.

### Re-Ranked Differential Diagnosis

Based on patient information, test results, and clinical presentation, the differential diagnoses are re-ranked in order of likelihood:

1. **Giant Cell Tumor of Tendon Sheath**: Given the localized swelling and MRI findings.
2. **Hematoma**: Persistent bruise post-injury is suspicious.
3. **Vascular Malformation**: Given the color and persistence, could be a vascular issue.
4. **Ganglion Cyst**: Given the soft tissue involvement.
5. **Superficial Thrombophlebitis**: Consider inflammation given the induration.
6. **Soft Tissue Sarcoma**: Persistent nature over two years.
7. **Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis**: MRI findings raise this possibility.
8. **Granuloma Annulare**: Less likely given the trauma history but still possible.
9. **Fibromatosis (Desmoid Tumor)**: Plaque-like presentation can mimic this.
10. **Frostbite sequelae**: Least likely without pertinent history of cold exposure.

By considering all given data, the chronic nature of the lesion, the preceding trauma, and MRI findings, a Giant Cell Tumor of Tendon Sheath stands out as the most likely diagnosis, followed by other considerations.","['Dermatology', 'Soft-Tissue Tumors']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30.0,F

### INPUT:
A 69-year-old woman with a newly diagnosed T3N2cM0 poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma unrelated to human papillomavirus (HPV) of the lower lip mucosa presented to the medical oncology clinic 3 days after initiating neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy with redness and swelling of the tumor site. Four days after treatment, a white head formed overlying the tumor that erupted through the skin surface (Figure 1). Thin, cloudy discharge that was not foul-smelling drained from the tumor from posttreatment days 5 to 10, at which point the drainage stopped spontaneously. Throughout, the patient reported no pain and remained afebrile. Laboratory results on days 5, 9, and 14 demonstrated the absence of leukocytosis, and serial wound cultures failed to demonstrate pathogenic growth. No antibiotics were administered. The patient completed the neoadjuvant immunotherapy and underwent a margin-negative tumor resection without intraoperative or postoperative complications. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Immunotherapy-related inflammation,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Immune-Related Adverse Event (irAE)**
   - Considering the patient's recent initiation of immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, an irAE such as immune-mediated dermatitis could present with redness and swelling.

2. **Tumor Necrosis**
   - The immune therapy might lead to tumor necrosis, causing breakdown and discharge from the malignancy itself.

3. **Cellulitis**
   - Redness and swelling at the site could indicate cellulitis, even though the patient is afebrile and cultures are negative.

4. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**
   - Unusual systemic manifestations in cancer patients that cause skin changes or other unusual symptoms.

5. **Wound Dehiscence**
   - Spontaneous drainage from a previously closed wound could indicate early wound dehiscence, though it typically follows surgery, not immunotherapy.

6. **Metastatic Disease**
   - Progression or new symptoms might be consistent with metastatic spread, although typically associated systemic signs are missing here.

7. **Drug Reaction**
   - Adverse drug reaction (ADR) to medication other than the immune checkpoint inhibitors.

8. **Radiation Dermatitis**
   - If the patient had received radiation therapy, one might consider radiation dermatitis, but this patient had no known radiation.

9. **Lymphatic Obstruction**
   - Swelling and drainage might suggest lymphatic involvement or obstruction related to cancer.

10. **Chronic Lymphedema**
    - Long-standing lymphedema could present with secondary skin changes, often associated with cancer or its treatment.

### Reranked Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Immune-Related Adverse Event (irAE)**: 
   - Given the recent initiation of immunotherapy and time correlation, this remains most likely.
   
2. **Tumor Necrosis**:
   - The characteristics of the drainage and the lack of systemic infection signs increase the likelihood of necrosis induced by treatment.

3. **Cellulitis**:
   - Although afebrile and negative cultures, once must always consider infections such as cellulitis clinically.

4. **Drug Reaction**:
   - Adverse reactions to new medications can present a wide array of symptoms.

5. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**:
   - Uncommon but possible systemic reaction secondary to malignancy.

6. **Wound Dehiscence**:
   - Less likely without preceding surgical intervention at the time of symptoms.

7. **Lymphatic Obstruction**:
   - Although a possible differential, less alignment with the timeframe and clinical presentation.

8. **Metastatic Disease**:
   - Without additional findings, less likely in the context described.

9. **Chronic Lymphedema**:
   - Swelling could theoretically indicate underlying chronic issues, although this would typically be part of longstanding and earlier patient history.

10. **Radiation Dermatitis**:
    - Least likely due to lack of known radiation treatment history.","['Dermatology', 'Targeted and Immune Therapy', 'Oncology', 'Surgery', 'Surgical Oncology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,69.0,F

### INPUT:
A 51-year-old previously healthy man was admitted with severe neck pain for 6 days. In the past month, he felt neck stiffness, accompanied by swelling and persistent dull pain of the upper anterior chest wall, which could be transiently relieved by taking oral ibuprofen. Six days before admission, the patient’s neck stiffness transited to an endurable dull ache. When turning his head, there was severe burning pain in the posterior neck and occiput, followed immediately by an electric shocklike numbness on ipsilateral side tongue, which led to a forced head position. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine with gadolinium on admission revealed signal abnormality in C1/C2 vertebrae (Figure 1A). In the past 3 days, with the intensification of neck pain, the patient found pustules on both hands, which gradually increased. He had no history of tobacco, alcohol, or drug misuse. On examination, he was afebrile. There was tenderness in the right sternoclavicular articulation, upper neck, post aurem, and occiput. Multiple pustules were seen in the palm and back of both hands (Figure 1B). Complete blood cell count and liver and kidney function yielded normal results, except for elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 93 mm/h and C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 5.5 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10). Results of workup for rheumatic and infectious disease, including antinuclear, antineutrophil cytoplasmic and anticardiolipin antibodies, human leukocyte antigen B27, repeated blood cultures, rapid plasma reagin test, Aspergillus galactomannan antigen, brucella, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and rickettsial antibodies, were all negative. Cell count, protein, and glucose in cerebrospinal fluid were normal. Cultures of cerebrospinal fluid revealed no organisms.

    ","Synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis syndrome","### Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Cervical Spondylodiscitis**: Considering the severe neck pain, signal abnormalities in C1/C2 vertebrae on MRI, and elevated inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP), cervical spondylodiscitis should be considered.
  
2. **Psoriatic Arthritis**: The combination of neck pain and pustules on the hands, alongside negative infectious and autoimmune tests, as well as elevated inflammatory markers, could point towards psoriatic arthritis.

3. **SAPHO Syndrome**: SAPHO (Synovitis, Acne, Pustulosis, Hyperostosis, and Osteitis) syndrome could explain the sternoclavicular tenderness, pustules on the hands, and inflammatory changes seen in imaging.

4. **Rheumatoid Arthritis with Cervical Spine Involvement**: While typical blood tests for rheumatoid arthritis may be negative, cervical spine involvement and symmetrical joint symptoms suggest RA could be a potential diagnosis.

5. **Ankylosing Spondylitis**: HLA-B27-negative Anklylosing Spondylitis should still be considered given the neck stiffness and inflammatory changes in imaging, although the typical peripheral arthritis is not as apparent in this case.

6. **Disseminated Gonococcal Infection**: Although the patient denies risky sexual behavior, disseminated gonococcal infection can sometimes present with pustules and joint pain.

7. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**: Even in the absence of detected malignancy, paraneoplastic syndromes related to occult cancers could present with musculoskeletal symptoms and pustulosis.

8. **Infective Endocarditis**: Despite the multiple negative cultures, the presentation could fit partially with endocarditis, especially if there were intermittent bacteremia or an unusual pathogen.

9. **IgG4-Related Sclerosing Disease**: This could involve multiple organ systems and present with inflammatory signs, radiographic abnormalities, and relatively normal hematologic findings.

10. **Multicentric Reticulohistiocytosis**: This rare disease can present with pustules and arthritis, although cervical spine involvement is less common.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on Available Information:

1. **SAPHO Syndrome**: The combination of pustules, inflammatory markers, and imaging findings strongly support this diagnosis. The typical presentation includes osteoarticular involvement, which matches the sternoclavicular tenderness and cervical spine MRI findings.
  
2. **Cervical Spondylodiscitis**: Despite negative cultures, the elevated ESR, CRP, and MRI findings still point towards an infectious or inflammatory etiology.
  
3. **Psoriatic Arthritis**: The pustules and inflammatory pain are supportive, though the patient doesn't have classical skin plaques one would expect in the majority of psoriatic arthritis cases.
  
4. **Rheumatoid Arthritis with Cervical Spine Involvement**: Even with negative RA serologies, the cervical involvement and inflammatory symptoms are consistent with extra-articular manifestations.
  
5. **Ankylosing Spondylitis**: While HLA-B27 is negative, atypical cases exist, and the symptoms and imaging findings do fit the spectrum of spondyloarthropathies.
  
6. **IgG4-Related Sclerosing Disease**: This diagnosis is considered due to the multifocal involvement and inflammatory nature, though less common.
  
7. **Multicentric Reticulohistiocytosis**: Given the rarity, pustules, and arthritis make it necessary to consider, especially with normal basic serologies and imaging findings at unusual sites.
  
8. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**: Although no malignancy was detected, it remains a potential diagnosis due to unexplained systemic symptoms.
  
9. **Disseminated Gonococcal Infection**: Less likely given the absence of risk factors and negative cultures, but persistent as a differential due to clinical presentation.
  
10. **Infective Endocarditis**: Unlikely given repeatedly negative blood cultures and absence of suggestive echocardiographic findings, but persistent due to the possibility of culture-negative endocarditis.","['Dermatology', 'Neurology', 'Rheumatology', 'Spinal Cord Disorders']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,51.0,M

### INPUT:
A 55-year-old male jazz musician with a medical history that was significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, and obstructive sleep apnea presented with an enlarging right more than left-sided neck mass of more than 2 years’ duration. The patient was seen and evaluated by a local surgical oncologist with a working diagnosis of possible lymphoma. The growing neck mass was causing solid food dysphagia and difficulty breathing at night. He did not have any neurological deficits. On further questioning, he had a similar mass that was treated with liposuction 10 years prior. His family history was negative for any head and neck benign or malignant disease. His social history was negative for tobacco or alcohol use. This patient was not taking any steroid medications. Physical examination showed an enlarged right more than left-sided neck mass. It was tense but compressible to palpation. Flexible fiber-optic laryngoscopy showed a crowded oropharynx with lingual tonsil hypertrophy and narrow oropharynx and hypopharynx. An outside computed tomography scan showed diffuse symmetric fatty infiltration of the pharynx, larynx, trachea, and esophagus. A magnetic resonance imaging scan with and without contrast (Figure, A) showed extensive areas of fat deposition within the neck that bilaterally extended from the level of C1 in the retropharyngeal space to the level of the sternal notch. Given that the patient was symptomatic, surgical intervention was recommended. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Madelung disease,"To develop a differential diagnosis for a 55-year-old male jazz musician with an enlarging neck mass and symptoms of dysphagia and difficulty breathing, consider the following steps and differential diagnoses:

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Lymphoma**:
   - Suggested by the initial working diagnosis of the local surgical oncologist due to the presentation of an enlarging neck mass.

2. **Lipoma**:
   - Given his history of a similar mass treated with liposuction previously, benign fat deposition could be considered.

3. **Thyroid Goiter**:
   - Thyroid enlargement can present similarly with a neck mass and compressive symptoms like dysphagia and breathing difficulty.

4. **Sarcoma**:
   - A malignancy originating from connective tissues could present as a growing neck mass.

5. **Infectious Lymphadenitis (e.g., Tuberculosis)**:
   - Chronic infection leading to enlarged lymph nodes that may be compressible.

6. **Metastatic Cancer**:
   - Secondary malignancies from another primary site, especially given the lack of significant familial history and social history.

7. **Dermoid Cyst**:
   - A congenital benign cyst that can enlarge and cause compressive symptoms.

8. **Paraganglioma**:
   - A rare neuroendocrine tumor that could present with a neck mass.

9. **Cervical Lymphadenopathy due to Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)**:
   - Enlargement of lymph nodes in CLL could present with similar symptoms.

10. **Castleman Disease**:
    - A rare disorder characterized by non-cancerous growths that can cause a neck mass.

### Rerank Based on Patient Information and Test Results:

Now, let's rerank the most likely diagnoses using all patient information and test results provided, particularly focusing on the presentation, physical examination findings, imaging results, and history:

1. **Lipoma**:
   - The presence of extensive fat deposition within the neck on MRI and a history of similar mass treated with liposuction strongly points towards this diagnosis.

2. **Lymphoma**:
   - Initially considered due to neck mass but less likely given the diffuse symmetric fatty infiltration observed on imaging.

3. **Thyroid Goiter**:
   - Typically presents as a focal mass rather than diffuse fat deposition; less likely given imaging findings.

4. **Castleman Disease**:
   - Less likely given the MRI findings of fat deposition, though it remains a consideration for unusual presentations.

5. **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)**:
   - Possible but less consistent with the MRI findings of fatty infiltration.

6. **Sarcoma**:
   - Less likely given the imaging characteristics.

7. **Infectious Lymphadenitis (e.g., Tuberculosis)**:
   - Unlikely considering the imaging findings of fat rather than inflammation.

8. **Paraganglioma**:
   - Unlikely with chronicity and lack of characteristic findings like splaying of carotid bifurcation.

9. **Metastatic Cancer**:
   - Less consistent with MRI findings but remains a differential due to the potential for atypical presentations.

10. **Dermoid Cyst**:
    - A remote possibility, but imaging more typical of benign lipomatous growth.

Given the clues from imaging and the patient's clinical history, a benign lipomatous condition like **Lipoma** emerges as the most probable diagnosis.","['Oncology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Soft-Tissue Tumors', 'Head and Neck Surgery']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,55.0,M

### INPUT:
A 54-year-old White woman with a history of lobular breast carcinoma in situ treated with lumpectomy as well as chromophobe kidney cell carcinoma treated with partial nephrectomy was referred for evaluation of an asymptomatic, amelanotic choroidal mass in her left eye, suspicious for metastatic disease. On examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU and intraocular pressures were normal in both eyes at 10 mm Hg. Slitlamp biomicroscopy of the anterior chamber was within normal limits in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination revealed normal findings in the right eye and clear vitreous with a subretinal mass in the left eye inferior to the optic disc and measuring 3 × 2 mm in base. Color fundus photography of the left eye (Figure, A) showed an amelanotic lesion under the retina inferior to the optic disc and 3 mm from the foveola surrounded by a subtle orange halo. Fundus autofluorescence (Figure, B) showed the lesion to be hyperautofluorescent. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the lesion showed the mass was primarily in the sclera and pushed and thinned the overlying choroid (Figure, C). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Focal scleral nodule,"### Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Metastatic Carcinoma**
2. **Choroidal Hemangioma**
3. **Choroidal Melanoma**
4. **Ocular Lymphoma**
5. **Choroidal Nevus**
6. **Posterior Scleritis**
7. **Retinoblastoma**
8. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome**
9. **Oculodermal Melanocytosis (Nevus of Ota)**
10. **Vasoproliferative Tumor**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Metastatic Carcinoma** - Given the patient's history of multiple carcinomas, metastasis to the choroid is highly likely.
2. **Choroidal Melanoma** - Despite being rare, a possibility due to the subretinal mass and hyperautofluorescent features.
3. **Choroidal Hemangioma** - Less likely due to absence of characteristic findings but must be considered.
4. **Ocular Lymphoma** - Important to consider given its occurrence in the uveal tract, though clinical signs are less suggestive.
5. **Posterior Scleritis** - Could present similarly, though absence of pain and normal intraocular pressure make this less likely.
6. **Choroidal Nevus** - Common benign lesions but less likely given patient's history and imaging characteristics.
7. **Vasoproliferative Tumor** - Usually presents differently but said signs can occasionally mimic those of more common conditions.
8. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome** - Although associated with abnormal fluid dynamics, the clinical picture is not classic for this syndrome.
9. **Retinoblastoma** - Much less likely due to patient's age, primarily affects pediatric population.
10. **Oculodermal Melanocytosis (Nevus of Ota)** - Extremely rare and typically presents differently regarding demographics and symptomatology.

In summary, given her oncological history, ""Metastatic Carcinoma"" is the most plausible diagnosis. Further diagnostic imaging and possible biopsy might be necessary to confirm this diagnosis.","['Nephrology', 'Breast Cancer', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Choroidal Disorders']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,54.0,F

### INPUT:
A 72-year-old man presented with mild proximal weakness developing into progressive camptocormia, head drop, and prominent dysphagia over a 2-year period. He reported a 20-kg weight loss and numbness to the ankles. His medical history was significant for thyroid cancer treated with total thyroidectomy resulting in a chronic left accessory nerve injury, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and gout. His medications were metformin, allopurinol, perindopril, thyroxine, and rabeprazole. He had no history of smoking and drank 3 glasses of wine per week. His family history was unremarkable. Examination revealed significant wasting of proximal and paraspinal muscles with a flexed spine posture in the upright position (Figure 1A). He had symmetric Medical Research Council grade 4/5 weakness of neck flexion, shoulder abduction, elbow flexion and extension, and hip flexion and extension bilaterally. He had weakness of left shoulder elevation and winging of the left scapula secondary to the accessory nerve injury. His deep tendon reflexes were normal and symmetric.

    ",Sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Myasthenia Gravis (MG)**: Considering the progressive muscle weakness and head drop.
   
2. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)**: Given the combination of proximal muscle weakness, weight loss, and dysphagia.
   
3. **Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis (sIBM)**: Due to the pattern of muscle weakness and chronic progression over 2 years.
   
4. **Polymyositis**: Considering the progressive proximal muscle weakness and absence of bulbar symptoms.
   
5. **Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN)**: Given the distal sensory involvement and progressive motor weakness.
   
6. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)**: Symmetrical weakness and sensory deficits could point to this.
   
7. **Post-Polio Syndrome**: Prior history of significant nerve injury alongside progressive weakness may suggest this.
   
8. **Diabetic Amyotrophy**: Given the patient's history of type 2 diabetes, this could be relevant due to proximal muscle weakness.
   
9. **Multiple Myeloma**: Unexplained weight loss and neurological symptoms could indicate this.
   
10. **Hypothyroid Myopathy**: Although on thyroxine, inadequate dosing might still lead to muscle weakness.

### Rerank All 10 Differential Diagnoses Using All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis (sIBM)**: The chronic progression, significant proximal weakness, camptocormia, and age-related profile strongly suggest sIBM.
   
2. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)**: Progressive, generalized weakness with weight loss and dysphagia remains highly suggestive of ALS.

3. **Myasthenia Gravis (MG)**: An important consideration due to muscle weakness and possible early head drop.
   
4. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)**: Sensory deficits and symmetrical weakness could correspond with CIDP.
   
5. **Diabetic Amyotrophy**: Given the patient's diabetic status, weight loss and proximal muscle weakness.
   
6. **Polymyositis**: The presentation is compatible, though lacks inflammatory markers usually seen with polymyositis.
   
7. **Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN)**: Fits the motor weakness pattern but less likely due to sensory involvement.
   
8. **Post-Polio Syndrome**: Less likely due to lack of initial infectious history but considered given past nerve injury.
   
9. **Multiple Myeloma**: Weight loss and neurological symptoms warrant this to be in differential though less fitting without other systemic signs.
   
10. **Hypothyroid Myopathy**: Given he is on thyroxine, hypothyroidism is less likely unless non-compliance or dosing issues exist.

### INPUT:
A healthy 12-year-old female individual received a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and reported visual symptoms 2 days later, with bilateral blurry vision, large blue paracentral scotomata, and a migraine without a scintillating scotoma. On clinical examination, visual acuity measured 20/70 + 1 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye, while she previously had visual acuity of 20/25 in each eye on examination 8 years prior. Motility, visual fields, and anterior segment examination results were normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed subtle reddish geographic irregularities at the level of the retinal pigment epithelial at a nasal juxtafoveal location in both eyes. The optic discs, vessels, and periphery were normal. Near-infrared (IR) imaging highlighted the irregularities in both eyes (Figure 1). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",COVID-19–associated acute macular neuroretinopathy,"Alright, let's proceed systematically through a differential diagnosis considering the symptoms and clinical findings:

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Acute Macular Neuroretinopathy**
   - This condition is characterized by paracentral scotomata and subtle changes in the retinal pigment epithelium that are highlighted on near-infrared imaging.

2. **Paracentral Acute Middle Maculopathy**
   - Another condition affecting the retinal layers, particularly in the macular region, leading to paracentral scotomata and could present similarly in retinal imaging.

3. **Multifocal Choroiditis**
   - Involves inflammatory lesions that may lead to scotomata and retinal abnormalities similar to what is observed in the patient's fundus examination.

4. **Acute Zonal Occult Outer Retinopathy (AZOOR)**
   - A disorder that can present with acute visual symptoms, including scotomata and often subtle retinal changes not readily apparent on examination but can be seen on imaging.

5. **Multiple Evanescent White Dot Syndrome (MEWDS)**
   - A condition characterized by sudden vision loss, scotomata, and small white retinal spots that are better seen on specialized imaging techniques.

6. **COVID-19 Retinopathy**
   - Considering the recent SARS-CoV-2 infection, there could be retinal involvement related to the viral infection itself, which has been reported in some cases.

7. **Optic Neuritis**
   - Although motility, fields, and anterior segments are normal, this condition typically presents with reduced visual acuity and can sometimes show subtle changes in fundus examination in severe cases.

8. **Acute Posterior Multifocal Placoid Pigment Epitheliopathy (APMPPE)**
   - Presents with sudden vision loss and multiple yellowish-white placoid lesions at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium.

9. **Viral Retinitis**
   - Other viral infections besides SARS-CoV-2, such as Herpes or Cytomegalovirus, can cause retinitis presenting with visual symptoms and abnormal retinal findings.

10. **Retinal Vasculitis**
    - Inflammation of the retinal blood vessels that can lead to scotomata, visual acuity changes, and subtle irregularities in the retinal examination.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis with Patient Information and Test Results

Based on the clinical presentation, recent history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and imaging findings:

### INPUT:
A woman in her 50s presented with a 3-month history of rapidly spreading intensively pruritic papules on her extremities. The lesions consisted of scattered, erythematous, annular papules measuring up to 5 mm wide (Figure 1). Further examination revealed a few asymptomatic brown flat papules scattered on her face; the palms, soles, and oral mucosa were not involved. The patient had no remarkable medical or family history and was not concurrently being treated with any medications. She had been previously diagnosed with eczema and treated with topical steroid ointments and oral compound glycyrrhizin tablets, which had no obvious effect. 
### OUTPUT:

### 9. Pityriasis Lichenoides Chronica
### 10. Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis

Next, we will re-rank these differential diagnoses by integrating all the patient's information and test results. 

### Step-by-Step Re-ranking:

1. **Lichen Planus**: The presentation of pruritic, annular erythematous papules is consistent with lichen planus, especially considering the involvement of the extremities and persistent nature despite treatment.
  
2. **Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma**: Given the patient's age and the chronic, pruritic nature of the lesions, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a critical consideration. A biopsy would be definitive.
 
3. **Bullous Pemphigoid**: Intensive pruritus and the chronic course might suggest bullous pemphigoid; however, typical bullae are not described.

4. **Prurigo Nodularis**: Another condition characterized by chronic intensely pruritic nodules; however, it typically presents as nodules rather than papules and is usually secondary to other pruritic conditions.
  
5. **Dermatitis Herpetiformis**: Characterized by pruritic papules and vesicles but typically involves elbows, knees, and buttock and is often associated with gluten sensitivity.

6. **Psoriasis**: Although the presentation is not classic for psoriasis, which usually includes plaques with silvery scale, it remains a differential diagnosis due to the chronicity and pruritus.

7. **Pityriasis Lichenoides Chronica**: Usually presents with papules that can become scaly and resemble psoriasis. Chronicity fits, but distribution is often more generalized.

8. **Grover's Disease (Transient Acantholytic Dermatosis)**: Presents with pruritic papules, but more common in older men and often related to heat and sweating.
  
9. **Secondary Syphilis**: Typically includes widespread rash including palms and soles, mucous lesions, and systemic symptoms, which are absent here.

10. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**: Rare condition that can present with skin lesions; often includes systemic involvement (bone pain, etc.), not described here.

### INPUT:
A man in his 80s with a history of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, permanent atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery bypass graft 10 years ago presented with recurrent presyncope and bradycardia. Review of prior physician encounters revealed reports of lightheadedness and electrocardiograms (ECGs) with atrial fibrillation with ventricular rates of 40 to 50 beats per minute. Current medications included carvedilol, 25 mg, twice daily and apixaban, 5 mg, twice daily. An ECG (Figure, A) showed atrial fibrillation with an irregular ventricular rate of around 60 beats per minute, right bundle branch block (RBBB), and left posterior fascicular block (LPFB). 
### OUTPUT:

2. **Atrioventricular (AV) Block**
3. **Medication-Induced Bradycardia (Beta-Blocker)**
4. **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)**
5. **Coronary Artery Disease (Ischemia)**
6. **Pulmonary Embolism**
7. **Hypothyroidism**
8. **Electrolyte Imbalance (e.g., Hyperkalemia)**
9. **Structural Heart Disease (e.g., Aortic Stenosis)**
10. **Cerebrovascular Event (e.g., Transient Ischemic Attack)**

### Re-Ranking Differential Diagnoses Based on All Patient Information and Test Results:
Given the patient’s history, medications, symptoms, and findings on the ECG (atrial fibrillation, right bundle branch block, and left posterior fascicular block), we re-rank the differential diagnoses as follows:

1. **Medication-Induced Bradycardia (Beta-Blocker)** - Given current medication (carvedilol) usage, which is known to cause bradycardia.
2. **Sick Sinus Syndrome (SSS)** - Symptoms and ECG findings suggestive of inadequate response to atrial fibrillation.
3. **Atrioventricular (AV) Block** - Irregular ventricular rate and past symptoms aligning with AV block scenarios.
4. **Coronary Artery Disease (Ischemia)** - Underlying history of CABG and could still contribute to symptoms.
5. **Structural Heart Disease (e.g., Aortic Stenosis)** - An important consideration given the age and history of cardiac issues.
6. **Electrolyte Imbalance (e.g., Hyperkalemia)** - Can precipitate bradycardia and should be checked.
7. **Hypothyroidism** - A common cause of bradycardia, especially in the elderly.
8. **Pulmonary Embolism** - Less likely, but still considered due to similar symptoms.
9. **Cerebrovascular Event (e.g., Transient Ischemic Attack)** - To be recalled if presyncope symptoms suggest neurological causes.
10. **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)** - Less likely but considered if orthostatic changes are noted in vital signs.

A 15-year-old adolescent girl who was taking an oral contraceptive presented to the emergency department with left lower quadrant abdominal pain that had developed gradually over a 3-day period. She had no associated nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematochezia, bloating, or anorexia. She reported no precipitating factors for the pain and had no history of pregnancy, abdominal surgery, or abdominal trauma. Over the previous 2 years, the patient had experienced similar intermittent episodes of abdominal pain lasting approximately 1 week. Results from laboratory tests, upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, and an abdominal computed tomography scan performed 1 year prior to presentation were normal. In the emergency department, her vital signs were normal and her body mass index was 20.4 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters). Abdominal examination revealed no rigidity or guarding; however, a 1-cm point of maximal tenderness was identified in the left lower abdominal quadrant (Figure). During palpation of this 1-cm area, the pain increased when she lifted her head and tensed her abdominal muscles. She experienced cold hypoesthesia when an alcohol gauze pad was applied to this area and severe pain when the skin was pinched.

### INPUT:
A school-aged girl presented to the dermatology clinic with a 6-year history of hair loss and short hair. Her scalp hair was relatively normal in terms of density and length at birth. Since the age of 1 year, the girl had begun to have frequent hair loss without pulling. Her mother also found that her hair grew to approximately the same maximum length down to the upper neck without trimming. On clinical examination, diffuse, short, sparse, lanugolike, black hair over the scalp was found (Figure, A and B). The surface of the scalp was smooth without inflammatory changes or focal alopecic patches. No involvement of eyebrows, eyelashes, nails, teeth, or body hair was found. Her intellectual performance was normal at presentation and no developmental delay had ever been noted. She denied experiencing a stressful event recently, and no habitual pulling of hair was observed by her family. Family history regarding hair loss was unremarkable. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp,"Let's work step by step to narrow down the differential diagnosis for the described case of hair loss:

1. **Alopecia Areata**: An autoimmune condition causing patchy hair loss; however, the diffuse nature without patches and the lanugolike hair makes this less likely.
2. **Telogen Effluvium**: Diffuse hair loss following a stressful event or illness; not supported by the description given the long-standing nature and lack of a triggering event.
3. **Trichotillomania**: Hair pulling disorder; no habitual pulling of hair was observed by family or patient, and smooth scalp without inflammatory changes is not consistent.
4. **Androgenetic Alopecia**: Common hair loss condition influenced by genetics and hormones; unlikely given her young age and the involvement pattern described.
5. **Loose Anagen Syndrome**: Condition where hair is easily pulled from the follicle, often in young children; fit with some features but lanugolike growth makes it less likely.
6. **Hypotrichosis Simplex of the Scalp**: Genetic condition with normal hair at birth but progressive loss and thinning over time. 
7. **Congenital Atrichia with Papular Lesions (APL)**: Genetic condition excellent for describing alopecia with no regrowth, but typically associated with skin lesions.
8. **Anagen Hair Loss (Diffuse Anagen Effluvium)**: Rapid diffuse shedding of hair during the anagen phase; less likely due to consistent presentation over several years without rapid changes.
9. **Hypothyroidism**: Thyroid dysfunction causing hair loss; usually involves other systemic symptoms and different hair patterns 
10. **Monilethrix**: Genetic disorder characterized by beaded hair and breakage; hair tends to be more brittle rather than lanugolike.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis based on All Information and Tests (clinical examination):

1. **Hypotrichosis Simplex of the Scalp**
2. **Loose Anagen Syndrome**
3. **Congenital Atrichia with Papular Lesions (APL)**
4. **Androgenetic Alopecia**

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 6-year-old boy taking no regular medications presented to the emergency department with persistent fever and cough for 15 days. Six days prior to presentation, multiple vesiculobullous lesions appeared on his palms and soles. Three days later, he developed erythema; vesicles and erosions on his face, trunk, and limbs; erosions on his lips and oral mucosa; eyelid swelling; and blisters on his anal mucosa. On presentation, his temperature was 38.7 °C (101.7 °F); heart rate, 125/min; blood pressure, 98/50 mm Hg; and oxygen saturation, 98% on room air. Physical examination revealed bilateral exudative conjunctivitis and white exudates on his tongue, posterior pharynx, and buccal mucosa. Erosions with overlying dried blood were noted around his eyes, lips, and anal mucosa. He had targetoid erythematous papules on his face and vesiculobullous lesions on his torso and extremities (Figure). Auscultation of his lungs revealed bilateral crackles. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 15 000/μL (82% neutrophils); erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 39 mm/h; and C-reactive protein level, 57.1 mg/L. A computed tomography scan of the chest revealed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates. Azithromycin (10 mg/kg daily, intravenously) was started. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption (RIME),"Sure, let’s outline a differential diagnosis step by step. Each step will represent a different possible diagnosis based on the patient’s presenting symptoms.

### Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)**: Presenting with fever, mucosal involvement, and widespread vesiculobullous lesions and targetoid lesions.
2. **Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease**: Considering vesiculobullous lesions on palms, soles, and oral mucosa involvement.
3. **Kawasaki Disease**: Persistent fever with conjunctivitis, oral mucosa changes, and hand/foot changes.
4. **Varicella (Chickenpox)**: Due to vesiculobullous lesions and fever.
5. **Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS)**: Diffuse erythema and possible blistering lesions, often involving mucosa.
6. **Herpetic Gingivostomatitis**: Due to widespread oral mucosa involvement and fever.
7. **Erythema Multiforme**: Presenting with targetoid lesions, fever, and involvement of oral mucosa.
8. **Measles**: Due to fever, conjunctivitis, oral mucosa involvement, and characteristic skin rash.
9. **Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection**: Due to bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and respiratory symptoms, in association with rash and fever.
10. **Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN)**: Severe mucocutaneous involvement and systemic symptoms such as fever and skin detachment.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

Reviewing all information and test results, a more refined ranking might look like:

1. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)**: Strongly indicates severe mucocutaneous involvement, target lesions, and systemic symptoms.
2. **Erythema Multiforme**: Due to target-like lesions and mucosal involvement.
3. **Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection**: Respiratory involvement with pulmonary infiltrates and possible extrapulmonary symptoms like skin rash.
4. **Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease**: Characteristic vesicles on palms and soles, although usually less severe mucosal involvement than seen here.
5. **Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS)**: Severe mucocutaneous involvement but less likely due to specific lesion pattern.
6. **Herpetic Gingivostomatitis**: Due to significant oral mucosal involvement but it usually does not present with such extensive skin rash.
7. **Varicella (Chickenpox)**: Widespread vesicular lesions but less likely with the described progression and pattern.
8. **Measles**: Characteristic rash and mucosal involvement but less likely given rapid progression and vesicular nature of the lesions.
9. **Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN)**: Severe mucocutaneous involvement but less likely due to patient's age and pattern of the lesions.
10. **Kawasaki Disease**: Involves fever and mucosal changes but typically not vesiculobullous lesions.

This ranking considers the patient’s clinical presentation, physical examination findings, and initial laboratory/imaging findings. Further diagnostic tests and specific history might refine these differentials even further.","['Dermatology', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Otolaryngology', 'Pediatrics']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.0,M

### INPUT:
A 16-year-old male patient developed acute-onset right-sided periorbital swelling several days after being hit in that area by a snowball. The swelling worsened over the following 3 weeks despite use of warm compresses and a course of doxycycline prescribed by his outside eye care professionals. He had progressive binocular diplopia and right periorbital pain, swelling, and redness. Blurriness of the right eye that started the week before presentation eventually caused enough concern that the patient presented to his local emergency department where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits revealed an intraconal mass (Figure, A). He then came to our institution’s emergency department for urgent ophthalmology consultation. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Orbital lymphangioma,"Certainly, let's go through a 10-step differential diagnosis for the presented case. Each step provides a single hypothesis without repeating any previous ones. 

1. **Orbital Cellulitis** - Given the acute-onset periorbital swelling, pain, and progression despite antibiotics, orbital cellulitis is a primary consideration.
   
2. **Orbital Fracture** - Trauma history suggests considering an orbital fracture that could be complicated by a hematoma or entrapment contributing to the symptoms.

3. **Retrobulbar Hematoma** - Post-trauma, intraconal blood collection could manifest as swelling and imaging-detected mass.

4. **Orbital Abscess** - Progression despite antibiotics raises suspicion for a collection of pus potentially forming a mass.

5. **Orbital Tumor (Rhabdomyosarcoma)** - The presence of an intraconal mass with a progressive clinical course could align with a primary orbital tumor.

6. **Lymphangioma** - A benign vascular tumor, typically multiloculated, can manifest similarly and often with a history of acute exacerbation post trauma or infection.

7. **Cavernous Hemangioma** - A common type of benign orbital tumor in young adults that presents with gradual onset of symptoms.

8. **Inflammatory Pseudotumor (Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome)** - Presents with similar signs and symptoms and can mimic infections or malignancies on imaging.

9. **Sinusitis with Orbital Extension** - Given the proximity of the sinuses to the orbits, this could explain the intraconal mass if the infection tracked back.

10. **Lymphoma** - Orbital lymphoma may also present with a mass and has a more insidious onset that could align with the time course.

### Final Reranking Using Full Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Orbital Abscess** - Given the inflammation, worsening condition despite antibiotics, and imaging findings.
   
2. **Orbital Cellulitis** - Highly plausible due to the periorbital pain, swelling, redness, and initial treatment with doxycycline.
   
3. **Orbital Tumor (Rhabdomyosarcoma)** - Progressive symptoms and mass consistent with this neoplasm, particularly in younger patients.
   
4. **Inflammatory Pseudotumor** - Imaging findings and the clinical progression align well with this diagnosis.
   
5. **Retrobulbar Hematoma** - The trauma history makes this a compelling option, albeit it usually presents acutely.
   
6. **Orbital Fracture** - While not immediately evident, fractures can lead to delayed complications that mimic these symptoms.
   
7. **Lymphoma** - The timeline and imaging could indicate this more insidious onset malignancy.
   
8. **Cavernous Hemangioma** - While typically slower in symptom onset, should still be considered.
   
9. **Lymphangioma** - History and symptoms could be aligned but are less likely given the initial treatment response.
   
10. **Sinusitis with Orbital Extension** - Last on the list due to primary orbital presentation but possible with active sinus disease.","['Emergency Medicine', 'Intraocular Tumors', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Orbit']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,16.0,M

### INPUT:
A South Asian male individual in his early 40s with a strong family history (FHx) of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) including premature cardiovascular events in multiple family members presented to establish care for cardiovascular risk stratification. He had no traditional risk factors for ASCVD and no cardiac symptoms or limitations. He had never smoked, was physically active, and did not take any medications. His 10-year ASCVD risk was estimated at 1.6% (low risk) based on the pooled cohort equations (PCEs); however, he had 2 risk-enhancing factors: South Asian ancestry and a FHx of premature ASCVD. His father had a myocardial infarction at age 39 years, and, importantly, his older brother had angioplasty with multiple stents at age 43 years. Additionally, multiple male cousins on his father’s side had coronary artery disease, the details of which were unspecified. Owing to his striking FHx of premature ASCVD, he underwent screening for elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and obtained a coronary calcium score. His Lp(a) level was elevated at 136 nmol/L and his coronary calcium score of 137 Agatston units was notable and placed him in the 94th percentile for his age (Figure 1). He returned to the office for further counseling on what to do next about these findings. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Elevated Lp(a) in the setting of strongly positive FHx and high coronary artery calcium score for the patient’s age,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps:
1. **Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH)**: Given a strong family history of premature ASCVD and elevated Lp(a), this is a primary consideration.
2. **Premature Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)**: Given the family history, it needs to be evaluated whether there’s an underlying condition predisposing to early coronary events.
3. **Lp(a) Hyperlipidemia**: Elevated Lp(a) levels are a strong risk factor for ASCVD, particularly in the presence of a family history.
4. **Mixed Dyslipidemia**: While he denies traditional risk factors, a thorough lipid profile including LDL, HDL, and triglycerides needs evaluation.
5. **Metabolic Syndrome**: Though no traditional risk factors are noted, this differential might involve checking for borderline or unsuspected issues such as insulin resistance.
6. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)**: This condition can occasionally present similarly in terms of family history of sudden cardiac events, though usually with physical findings or symptoms.
7. **Chronic Inflammatory Conditions**: Conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, although less likely due to lack of symptoms, should be considered as they can increase cardiovascular risk.
8. **Subclinical Atherosclerosis**: Given the calcium score, subclinical atherosclerosis is a concern.
9. **Hyperhomocysteinemia**: Elevated homocysteine levels can increase cardiovascular risk and should be tested, especially in context of FHx.
10. **Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)**: It can independently elevate cardiovascular risk and should be considered in the differential list for full evaluation.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH)**: Given the strong family history and Lp(a) elevation, this remains top.
2. **Lp(a) Hyperlipidemia**: The elevated Lp(a) level directly correlates with his cardiovascular risk and family history.
3. **Premature Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)**: Corroborated by family history and coronary calcium score, this diagnosis warrants close attention.
4. **Subclinical Atherosclerosis**: High coronary calcium score places him at significant vascular risk.
5. **Mixed Dyslipidemia**: Potentially explain the patient’s underlying cardiovascular risk, despite a negative traditional risk factor profile.
6. **Hyperhomocysteinemia**: Elevated levels may interact with other lipid abnormalities increasing risk.
7. **Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)**: Should be assessed given its body-wide inflammatory nature influencing ASCVD.
8. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)**: Given premature cardiovascular death in family history, although less likely due to lack of current symptoms.
9. **Chronic Inflammatory Conditions**: Exercise caution for conditions that can elevate cardiovascular risk subclinically.
10. **Metabolic Syndrome**: Although no overt signs, a closer study might reveal more integrated risk factors for ASCVD.

Ultimately, FH and elevated Lp(a) should be prioritized for early interventions and management, while continuing comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment and prevention strategies tailored to his specific risk profile.","['Cardiac Imaging', 'Cardiovascular Risk Factors', 'Ischemic Heart Disease', 'Cardiology', 'Dyslipidemia']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,40.0,M

### INPUT:
A 52-year-old man with a history of severe primary open-angle glaucoma in both eyes and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in response to topical corticosteroids presented with an IOP above target of 19 to 23 mm Hg OS. He also had mild chronic macular edema in both eyes after remote cataract surgery and vitrectomy with membrane peel in both eyes. Two years prior, he underwent Baerveldt tube shunt in his left eye, and his IOP since surgery had been 8 to 14 mm Hg. Ophthalmic medications on presentation were timolol eye drops twice daily, brinzolamide-brimonidine eye drops 3 times daily, bimatoprost eye drops every night at bedtime, bromfenac eye drops once daily, and fluorometholone eye drops twice daily in both eyes. During his visit, the patient complained of severe physical exhaustion, syncopal episodes, dysphagia, and sinus congestion. On external examination, he had diffuse facial edema and erythema without proptosis. Slitlamp examination showed mild chemosis and hyperemia in both eyes and a patent Baerveldt tube ostium in the midanterior chamber with normal bleb morphology without a tense capsule. A 24-2 Humphrey visual field showed new glaucoma progression in the left eye (Figure 1). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Elevated IOP due to elevated episcleral venous pressure secondary to superior vena cava syndrome,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Allergic Reaction** – Consider an allergic reaction due to facial edema, erythema, and systemic symptoms after reviewing current medications.
2. **Ocular Hypertension** – Given the history of glaucoma and recent increase in intraocular pressure.
3. **Medication Side Effects** – Review potential side effects of current ophthalmic medications like timolol, brinzolamide-brimonidine, bimatoprost, bromfenac, and fluorometholone.
4. **Cushing's Syndrome** – Due to chronic steroid use and associated systemic symptoms (severe physical exhaustion, facial edema).
5. **Obstructive Sleep Apnea** – Symptoms like severe physical exhaustion and facial edema could be indicative of sleep-related breathing disorders.
6. **Congestive Heart Failure** – Facial edema and systemic symptoms like exhaustion could indicate cardiovascular issues.
7. **Thyroid Eye Disease** – Examine for thyroid dysfunction given associated ocular and systemic symptoms.
8. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** – Facial erythema, edema, and multi-system involvement could indicate an autoimmune condition.
9. **Sinusitis or Sinus-related Issues** – Due to sinus congestion and associated facial symptoms.
10. **Chronic Fatigue Syndrome** – Given the severe physical exhaustion and syncopal episodes.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on All Information

1. **Medication Side Effects** – Due to the extensive use of several ophthalmic medications known for systemic side effects.
2. **Cushing's Syndrome** – The chronic use of steroids and systemic symptoms make this a probable consideration.
3. **Allergic Reaction** – Symptoms like facial edema, erythema, and systemic indications support this.
4. **Ocular Hypertension** – Warranted by the history of glaucoma and observed increase in IOP.
5. **Thyroid Eye Disease** – Because of the presenting ocular symptoms and potential thyroid dysfunction.
6. **Congestive Heart Failure** – Severe physical exhaustion and facial edema corroborate potential heart issues.
7. **Obstructive Sleep Apnea** – The exhaustion and facial edema align with sleep apnea.
8. **Sinusitis or Sinus-related Issues** – Sinus congestion and facial symptoms support this.
9. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** – The possibility of an autoimmune disorder due to systemic signs.
10. **Chronic Fatigue Syndrome** – Given continued severe physical exhaustion and systemic symptoms.","['Glaucoma', 'Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Radiation Oncology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,52.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his 70s presented with a 6-month history of a rash on the left forearm, which gradually increased in severity. The patient developed a rash on the dorsal aspect of his hand half a year ago without any pain or itching discomfort and denied any history of injury or exposure to suspected pathogens prior to onset. After self-medication with topical herbal medicine, the lesions gradually spread to the forearm and fused into plaques, and ulcers often recurred on the surface. He denied any systemic symptoms and concerns. Physical examination revealed large, firm, mildly swollen erythematous plaques on the back of the left forearm with purulent discharge and crusting (Figure, A). Results of routine laboratory investigations, including complete blood cell count, biochemical profile, and chest radiography, were normal. A biopsy specimen was taken for pathological examination (Figure, B-D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cutaneous protothecosis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** (BCC)
    - Non-healing ulcerative lesions, common in elderly patients, can present with firm plaques and purulent discharge.
    
2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** (SCC)
    - Typically presents as ulcerative lesions or plaques, especially in areas of chronic irritation or sun exposure.

3. **Cutaneous Tuberculosis**
    - Presents as chronic, non-healing ulcers, often with purulent discharge, common in older adults.

4. **Chronic Ulcerative Pyoderma (Pyoderma Gangrenosum)**
    - Necrotizing ulcerative lesions, often painful, but can sometimes present without pain or system involvement.

5. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica**
    - Chronic plaques with potential ulceration, though less common on forearm and usually not with purulent discharge.

6. **Chronic Stasis Dermatitis**
    - Erythematous plaques often on lower extremities, but possible on forearm with chronic venous issues.

7. **Deep Mycosis (e.g., Sporotrichosis)**
    - Chronic skin infection presenting as plaques or ulcers, might not have systemic symptoms.

8. **Chronic Actinic Dermatitis**
    - Chronic erythematous plaques due to long-term sun exposure, potentially ulcerative.

9. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma**
    - Aggressive and rare form of skin cancer presenting as firm, rapidly growing plaques or nodules.

10. **Leprosy**
    - Chronic infectious disease causing skin ulcers or plaques, typically with hypopigmentation.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

Given the chronic, non-painful, ulcerative plaques with purulent discharge, and considering the pathology report:

1. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** (SCC)
    - Most likely given the chronic ulcerating and crusting plaque, commonly seen in elderly patients with prolonged sun exposure.

2. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** (BCC)
    - Common in elderly with non-healing plaques and ulceration, though typically less purulent.

3. **Chronic Ulcerative Pyoderma (Pyoderma Gangrenosum)**
    - Possible due to presenting characteristics, although typically more painful.

4. **Cutaneous Tuberculosis**
    - Chronic ulcerative lesions with discharge can resemble TB, though less common without systemic symptoms.

5. **Deep Mycosis (e.g., Sporotrichosis)**
    - Plaque-like lesions with ulceration can indicate a chronic fungal cause.

6. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica**
    - Though less typical on forearm, chronic plaques with potential ulceration fit.

7. **Chronic Stasis Dermatitis**
    - Uncommon presentation on forearm, but chronic plaques and ulcers could occur.

8. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma**
    - Rare, rapid-growing nodules mostly on sun-exposed skin, though less common with purulence.

9. **Leprosy**
    - Chronic skin disease with ulcerative plaques, rare but possible in differential.

10. **Chronic Actinic Dermatitis**
    - Less likely as it usually presents more diffusely and less ulceratively. ","['Dermatology', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Skin Infections']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,70.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his 80s with a medical history of gastric adenocarcinoma treated with total gastrectomy presented with asymptomatic lesions on his tongue that gradually developed during the previous 3 months. Intraoral examination revealed multiple yellowish to erythematous papules and verrucous cobblestone-like plaques on the mucosal surface on both sides of his tongue (Figure, A and B). The skin of the face, neck, arms, and other sun-exposed areas did not reveal any associated lesions. He reported occasional alcohol intake, and there was no history of tobacco-related habits or oral trauma. The results of laboratory investigations, including a complete blood cell count, serum chemistry panel, liver and kidney function test, C-reactive protein levels, lipid profile, and serum and urine electrophoresis disclosed no abnormalities. With the clinical suspicion of squamous cell carcinoma, an incisional biopsy was performed (Figure, C and D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Nodular colloid degeneration,"1. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**
   - Incisional biopsy was performed with clinical suspicion of SCC.
   
2. **Oral Lichen Planus**
   - Considering the cobblestone-like appearance and erythematous papules.
   
3. **Oral Candidiasis**
   - Taking into account the patient's age and immune status post-gastrectomy.
   
4. **Verrucous Carcinoma**
   - Given the verrucous and cobblestone-like nature of the lesions.
   
5. **Geographic Tongue**
   - Ease in different pattern and coloration of the tongue lesions.
   
6. **Oral Leukoplakia**
   - Considering white and erythematous patches in the oral mucosa.
   
7. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**
   - Autoimmune mucocutaneous blistering disease, fits description of oral lesions.
   
8. **Erythroplakia**
   - Given the presence of erythematous lesions in the oral cavity.
   
9. **Lupus Erythematosus**
   - Possible autoimmune etiology for the tongue lesions, though less likely without skin lesions.
   
10. **Syphilis (Secondary Stage)**
    - Characterized by mucosal patches, though systemic symptoms usually accompany.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**
   - Clinical suspicion and biopsy being performed strongly suggest SCC.
2. **Verrucous Carcinoma**
   - Verrucous and cobblestone-like nature aligns with this slow-growing variant of SCC.
3. **Oral Lichen Planus**
   - Common condition that presents with similar appearing erythematous papules and plaques.
4. **Oral Leukoplakia**
   - Potentially precancerous condition that fits the description.
5. **Erythroplakia**
   - High-risk lesions that are often premalignant or malignant.
6. **Lupus Erythematosus**
   - Autoimmune condition with oral involvement, though less likely without cutaneous manifestations.
7. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**
   - Autoimmune blistering disease, although less typical without extensive erosions.

A 46-year-old man with no significant medical history presented to the emergency department (ED) 6 hours after a 20-minute episode of chest pain and diaphoresis that occurred at rest and resolved spontaneously. Two days earlier, he reported a similar 20-minute episode of chest pain and diaphoresis. The patient currently smoked 30 cigarettes per day and had a 20 pack-year history of smoking. He was taking no daily medications and had no family history of cardiovascular disease. On admission to the ED, the patient was asymptomatic. Blood pressure was 102/74 mm Hg, heart rate was 84/min, and oxygen saturation was 100% on room air. His physical examination results were unremarkable. Laboratory testing produced the following results: troponin T, 16 ng/mL (reference, <14 ng/mL); creatine kinase (CK), 82 U/L (1.37 µkat/L) (reference, <190 U/L [<3.17 µkat/L]); CK-MB, 16 U/L (reference, <24 U/L); low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, 106 mg/dL (2.75 mmol/L) (reference, <130 mg/dL [<3.37 mmol/L]); and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, 38 mg/dL (0.98 mmol/L) (reference, >35 mg/dL [>0.91 mmol/L]).

6. **Costochondritis**
7. **Pneumothorax**
8. **Atypical Angina (Microvascular Angina)**
9. **Anxiety/Panic Attack**
10. **Esophageal Spasm**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)**
    - Given the elevated troponin T (16 ng/mL), recent episodes of chest pain and diaphoresis, and significant smoking history, ACS is the top differential diagnosis.

2. **Atypical Angina (Microvascular Angina)**
    - Despite normal CK-MB levels and unremarkable ECG, this could still present with elevated troponin in the context of ischemic symptoms and risk factors.

3. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**
    - Consideration due to recurrent chest pain relieved spontaneously, although less likely with elevated troponins.

4. **Pericarditis**
    - Pericarditis often presents with chest pain but lower suspicion without characteristic ECG changes and specific pain patterns.

5. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)**
    - Less likely due to normal oxygen saturation and no significant risk factors presented, but still a differential in chest pain settings.

6. **Aortic Dissection**
    - Unlikely given stable, non-hypertensive blood pressure and absence of severe, tearing pain radiating to the back.

7. **Esophageal Spasm**
    - Can mimic ACS but less likely due to elevated troponin levels.

8. **Costochondritis**
    - Patient’s history and risk factors make this less likely in the setting of elevated cardiac biomarkers.

9. **Pneumothorax**
    - Lower suspicion given stable vital signs, normal oxygen saturation, and lack of supporting physical examination findings.

10. **Anxiety/Panic Attack**
    - While anxiety can mimic cardiac symptoms, it is less likely due to objective evidence (elevated troponin).

Note: The differential diagnosis largely points towards a cardiac etiology, with ACS remaining the most probable given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings.","['Acute Coronary Syndromes', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiothoracic Surgery', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Ischemic Heart Disease']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,46.0,M

A patient in their mid-60s was referred for evaluation of a left iris pigmented lesion. The mass had been present for decades and multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists, most recently 4 years prior, showed the mass remained stable in size. The patient’s ocular history included cataract extraction with intraocular lens placement and retinal tear of the right eye and cataract of the left eye. Review of systems was negative for any recent changes in health, weight loss, fever, or night sweats. Visual acuity without correction was 20/20 OD and 20/25+ OS. Intraocular pressures were normal. Slitlamp examination of the right eye was unremarkable, and the left eye had a raised pigmented iris lesion without prominent internal vasculature and with mammillations on the surface (multiple small smooth dome-shaped protuberances on the surface of the tumor). There were large pigment granules on the surface of the tumor and on the adjacent iris surrounding the mass (Figure 1A). There was no ectropion uvea or iris neovascularization. There were mild nuclear sclerotic changes across the lens in the left eye. Ultrasound biomicroscopy showed a homogeneous intrinsic iris solid tumor with a height of 1.4 mm and basal diameter of 4.1 mm, without angle or ciliary body involvement (Figure 1B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Iris melanocytoma,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis
1. **Iris Nevus**:
   - A benign, pigmented lesion of the iris which generally shows slow growth or remains stable over time.

2. **Iris Melanoma**:
   - A malignant tumor of the iris which can present as a raised, pigmented lesion and requires thorough imaging and histological assessment.

3. **Iris Cyst**:
   - Benign fluid-filled lesions that can appear pigmented due to their content and generally are stable over time.

4. **Pigmented Iris Epithelium Cyst**:
   - A rare type of cyst arising from the pigment epithelium of the iris.

5. **Lisch Nodules** (associated with Neurofibromatosis):
   - Raised pigmented lesions on the iris seen in patients with neurofibromatosis but typically multiple rather than solitary.

6. **Ocular Melanocytosis**:
   - Congenital condition of hyperpigmentation that can affect the uveal tract including the iris.

7. **Ciliary Body Melanoma**:
   - Although primarily involving the ciliary body, it can sometimes extend to affect the iris.

8. **Fuch’s Adenoma**:
   - A benign hyperplasia of the ciliary epithelium that could present near or involving the iris.

9. **Metastatic Carcinoma to the Iris**:
   - Secondary cancerous lesions that could metastasize to the iris, including prior history of systemic malignancy.

10. **Iris Granuloma**:
   - Inflammatory nodules that can sometimes masquerade as pigmented lesions although often associated with other systemic signs of inflammation.

### Re-ranked Differential Diagnosis

Given the details in the case—the longstanding nature of the lesion, stable size over multiple prior evaluations, lack of symptoms such as pain or vision changes, mild nuclear sclerotic changes in the lens, and ultrasound biomicroscopy findings suggesting a homogeneous intrinsic iris solid mass without deeper involvement—the differential diagnosis list can be re-ordered emphasizing benign conditions that align with a stable, longstanding iris lesion:

1. **Iris Nevus**:
   - Most plausible due to the stability over time and benign appearance.

2. **Pigmented Iris Epithelium Cyst**:
   - Less common but still possible considering the presentation.

3. **Ocular Melanocytosis**:
   - Consistent with longstanding pigmented lesion but less likely without other pigmented areas or systemic features.

4. **Iris Cyst**:
   - Despite the solid nature on imaging, still remains a possibility given stable course.

5. **Fuch’s Adenoma**:
   - Uncommon but fits some of the benign characteristics described.

6. **Lisch Nodules**:
   - Less likely given solitary nature, but stable, pigmented lesions can masquerade.

7. **Ciliary Body Melanoma**:
   - Although primarily involves the ciliary body, it's considered for thorough differential but less likely without ciliary involvement.

8. **Metastatic Carcinoma to the Iris**:
   - Unlikely, given lack of systemic cancer history and stable nature over decades.

9. **Iris Granuloma**:
   - Unlikely without systemic inflammation or changes.

10. **Iris Melanoma**:
   - Still a differential due to the nature of the pigmented lesion but less favored due to stability and benign findings.","['Intraocular Tumors', 'Ophthalmology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,65.0,U

### INPUT:
A 61-year-old man presented to our clinic with a 3-month history of rapidly growing and itchy cutaneous nodules all over the body. He denied systemic complaints such as weakness, fever, night sweats, or weight loss. Oral glucocorticoids did not show any therapeutic effect. His medical history was remarkable for mild anemia because of untreated hemorrhoids. Physical examination revealed numerous symmetrically distributed, well-defined, erythematous skin nodules on his back, buttocks, and limb extensors (Figure, A). Prominent lymphadenopathies on bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes were noted, with the largest lymph node measuring approximately 5 × 2 cm. Laboratory tests were significant for atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood (count up to 6%), an elevated CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio (9.21; normal range, 0.7-3.1), moderate anemia (hemoglobin level, 8.7 g/dL; normal range, 11.5-15.0 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]), a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (35 mm/h; normal range, 0-25 mm/h), and cryoglobulins composed of mixed polyclonal immunoglobulins. The platelet count (161 × 103/μL; normal range, 125-350 × 103/μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 1.0]) and lactate dehydrogenase (217 U/L; normal range, 100-240 U/L [to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167]) were normal. Quantification of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA showed high loads of virus in the peripheral blood (846 copies/mL in serum, 27 700 copies/mL in lymphocytes; normal range, <500 copies/mL). A biopsy specimen from a skin nodule was sent for histopathologic examination (Figure, B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cutaneous angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL)** - Rapidly growing and itchy cutaneous nodules, elevated CD4+/CD8+ ratio, atypical lymphocytes.
2. **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-associated Lymphoproliferative Disorder** - High EBV DNA loads in peripheral blood.
3. **Multicentric Castleman Disease** - Prominent lymphadenopathy, high ESR, generalized symptoms.
4. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans** - Numerous well-defined skin nodules.
5. **Sarcoidosis** - Symmetrical erythematous nodules, lymphadenopathy.
6. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - Generalized symptoms, skin involvement, anemia.
7. **Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL)** - Elevated CD4+/CD8+ ratio, atypical lymphocytes, nodules.
8. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - Skin nodules, lymphadenopathy.
9. **Lymphomatoid Papulosis** - Erythematous skin nodules, lymphadenopathy.
10. **Primary Cutaneous B-cell Lymphoma** - Skin nodules, lymphadenopathy.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
Based on the following patient information and test results, the top 10 differentials are reranked below:

1. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL)** - This remains the top diagnosis given the presence of rapidly growing and itchy skin nodules, high CD4+/CD8+ ratio, and atypical lymphocytes.
2. **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-associated Lymphoproliferative Disorder** - High EBV DNA loads, lymphadenopathy.
3. **Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL)** - Given the elevated CD4+/CD8+ ratio, atypical lymphocytes, and systemic involvement.
4. **Multicentric Castleman Disease** - Based on prominent lymphadenopathy and systemic inflammatory signs.
5. **Primary Cutaneous B-cell Lymphoma** - Skin nodules and prominent lymphadenopathy.
6. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - Due to skin nodules and lymphadenopathy.
7. **Lymphomatoid Papulosis** - Erythematous skin nodules and lymphadenopathy.
8. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans** - Multiple well-defined skin nodules.
9. **Sarcoidosis** - Symmetrically distributed erythematous skin nodules.
10. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - Generalized symptoms, skin involvement, anemia.","['Dermatology', 'Oncology', 'Lymphomas', 'Skin Lymphomas']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,61.0,M

### INPUT:
A 68-year-old man with a medical history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and obesity had undergone C5 anterior corpectomy and fusion (C4-6) with expandable cage, autograft, and anterior instrumentation and posterior spinal decompression and fusion (C4-7) for cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Five months after surgery, he presented to the otolaryngology clinic with 3 weeks of mild odynophagia and dysphagia. It was noted that the patient had a prominent posterior pharyngeal wall, subtle asymmetry of vocal fold motion, and pooling of secretions in the left pyriform (Video 1). During the next 6 months, he gradually developed shortness of breath and stridor, and eventually presented to the emergency department in respiratory distress requiring intubation for 2 days. Shortly after extubation, laryngeal examination showed fullness of the posterior pharyngeal wall and severely limited vocal fold abduction bilaterally (Figure 1A; Video 1). A modified barium swallow study showed intermittent laryngeal penetration without aspiration (Video 2). Although the patient was unable to tolerate magnetic resonance imaging, a soft tissue computed tomography scan of the neck with contrast revealed a well-positioned plate with no evidence of fluid collection in the setting of a normal leukocyte count. One month later, a neuromuscular specialist investigated potential underlying neurological causes; however, results of nerve conduction, antiacetylcholine receptor, antimuscle-specific kinase, methylmalonic acid, HIV, rapid plasma reagin, vitamin B-12, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroxine, copper, creatine kinase, and immunofixation studies were all unremarkable. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Delayed iatrogenic bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP),"Let's develop a differential diagnosis step-by-step:

1. **Bilateral Vocal Fold Paralysis**: Given the significant limitation in vocal fold abduction bilaterally, this is a key differential to consider.
2. **Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Injury**: Post-surgical complications could lead to similar symptoms, especially following neck surgeries.
3. **Pharyngeal Edema**: Post-operative edema can cause airway obstruction and impact vocal fold motion.
4. **Posterior Pharyngeal Wall Abscess**: Although less likely given the absence of fluid collection, it's notable in such a clinical context.
5. **Myasthenia Gravis**: Despite unremarkable antiacetylcholine receptor and antimuscle-specific kinase tests, neuromuscular causes must be considered.
6. **Arnold-Chiari Malformation**: A vascular or congenital malformation can present with significant neurological deficits impacting swallowing and breathing.
7. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)**: A progressive neuromuscular disorder could explain the progression of symptoms.
8. **Cricopharyngeal Dysfunction**: This is another primary functional disorder affecting swallowing mechanics.
9. **Hypopharyngeal Cancer**: Could present similarly with mass effect and local invasion, markedly progressive symptoms.
10. **Multiple Sclerosis**: Rare involvement of cranial nerves could mimic these symptoms.

### Reranking using all patient information and test results:
Let's reevaluate the differential diagnoses based on the gathered patient data, including unremarkable results from extensive neuromuscular tests and imaging, focusing on the most logical explanation fitting the timeline and clinical presentation:

1. **Bilateral Vocal Fold Paralysis**: Primary consideration based on bilateral vocal fold immobility.
2. **Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Injury**: Likely given the recent surgery in the cervical region.
3. **Pharyngeal Edema**: Post-surgical complication potentially exacerbated by obesity.
4. **Posterior Pharyngeal Wall Abscess**: Less likely without fluid collection; however, still a differential.
5. **Myasthenia Gravis**: Despite negative tests, potential neuromuscular cause.
6. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)**: Progressive muscle weakness plausible.
7. **Cricopharyngeal Dysfunction**: Contributing to swallowing difficulties.
8. **Arnold-Chiari Malformation**: Suitable revaluation for vascular/congenital anomaly.
9. **Hypopharyngeal Cancer**: While less common, must not be ruled out.
10. **Multiple Sclerosis**: Less typical but a consideration given potential neurological involvement.

### INPUT:
A 75-year-old woman presenting with decreased visual acuity and metamorphopsia in the right eye was referred for further evaluation of a pigmented epiretinal membrane. She had a history of cutaneous nodular melanoma in the right arm. Tumor staging was classified as T3N0M0 in August 2017, at the time of diagnosis and excision. In April 2018, axillary lymphadenectomy was performed for local recurrence and the patient started treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pembrolizumab, without further local or metastatic evidence of the tumor. Ocular history was positive for cataract surgery bilaterally. After cataract surgery in the right eye, an asymptomatic vision loss was noted and the cause was attributed to the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), for which the patient underwent intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections. Examination showed a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/60 OD and 20/20 OS, unremarkable anterior segment findings, and intraocular pressures of 12 mm Hg OU. A fundus examination in the right eye revealed scarce pigmented cells in the anterior vitreous, a dark-pigmented epiretinal membrane, and an area of retinal hyperpigmentation in the inferior temporal arcade corresponding to the CNV (Figure 1). Optical coherence tomography imaging revealed a hyperreflective structure on the surface of the inner retina with increased macular thickness, compatible with the described epiretinal membrane (Figure 1). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cutaneous melanoma metastatic to the vitreous cavity and deposition of melanoma cells over the epiretinal membrane,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Choroidal Melanoma**
   - Considering her history of nodular melanoma and the presence of pigmented lesions.

2. **Epiretinal Membrane**
   - Known diagnosis with imaging (OCT) showing a hyperreflective structure on the inner retina.

3. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**
   - Common cause of visual impairment in the elderly, correlating with choroidal neovascularization.

4. **Metastatic Melanoma**
   - Given her history of cutaneous melanoma, metastasis to the eye cannot be overlooked.

5. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC)**
   - Can present with vision changes and retinal abnormalities, though less common at this age.

6. **Ocular Sarcoidosis**
   - Can present with vitritis and pigmented lesions; less likely but needs considering.

7. **Uveal Melanoma**
   - Different from choroidal melanoma but still a primary ocular melanocytic tumor.

8. **Diabetic Retinopathy**
   - Retinal changes secondary to diabetes could present similarly, although no mention of diabetes in history.

9. **Idiopathic Macular Telangiectasia**
   - Can present with similar retinal changes and metamorphopsia.

10. **Peripheral Retinal Degeneration**
    - Degenerative changes in the peripheral retina can sometimes affect central vision.

### Reranking Based on Complete Information:

1. **Epiretinal Membrane**
   - Confirmed on OCT and aligns with the primary imaging findings.

2. **Choroidal Melanoma**
   - Given the previous history of melanoma and pigmented retinal lesions.

3. **Metastatic Melanoma**
   - Strong historical context given the previous more aggressive cutaneous melanoma staging and treatment history.

4. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**
   - Presence of CNV fits this diagnosis, a common cause in elderly patients.

5. **Uveal Melanoma**
   - Less likely but considered due to pigmented lesions and melanoma history.

6. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC)**
   - Less likely given age and previous ocular history, but still possible.

7. **Ocular Sarcoidosis**
   - Vitreous involvement and pigmented cells demand consideration, though less common.

8. **Idiopathic Macular Telangiectasia**
   - Could explain vision changes and found retinal abnormalities, less likely without systemic symptoms.

9. **Peripheral Retinal Degeneration**
   - Secondary cause, less likely without peripheral findings on examination.

10. **Diabetic Retinopathy**
    - Hardly considered, no patient history of diabetes or typical findings described. 

Thus, the most likely diagnosis centers on the epiretinal membrane, with neoplastic considerations closely following.","['Dermatology', 'Intraocular Tumors', 'Oncology', 'Skin Cancer', 'Retinal Disorders']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,75.0,F

### INPUT:
A 3-month-old boy was referred for evaluation of multiple cutaneous red papules. The guardian reported first noticing the papules at birth. During the following months, the papules grew in number and size, involving the head and neck, trunk, extremities, right palm, mons pubis, and buttocks. At the height of severity, the patient had 39 lesions, some of which were associated with ulceration and bleeding. The patient was born at full term via spontaneous vaginal delivery; the birth mother had not received prenatal care. Neither the birth mother nor the infant had any known history of environmental or occupational exposure to hazardous substances. The paternal family medical history was unremarkable; maternal family medical history was unknown. Physical examination revealed numerous bright red macules, papules, and plaques ranging in size from 1.0 × 1.0 mm to 2.2 × 2.3 cm, many of which had hemorrhagic crust and dark scale (Figure, A and B). Additional examination findings included retrognathia, thickened maxillary frenulum, and anterior ankyloglossia.

6. **Spitz Nevus**
7. **Mastocytosis (cutaneous)**
8. **Tuberous Sclerosis Complex**
9. **Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome**
10. **Nevus Sebaceous**

### Reranking Based on All Patient Information and Test Results:
1. **Infantile Hemangiomas**: Given the presentation of multiple cutaneous red papules noticed at birth, increasing number and size over time, and association with ulceration and bleeding, infantile hemangiomas (despite the lack of typical perinatal regression) fit the clinical picture well.
2. **Congenital Hemangiomas**: Can be noted at birth and show aggressive growth, although they often stabilize or involute sooner than infantile hemangiomas.
3. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**: Multiple red papules with ulceration and bleeding could suggest this, especially with the involvement of multiple body regions.
4. **Kaposiform Hemangioendothelioma**: Considered due to the vascular nature and potential for bleeding and ulceration but less common.
5. **Pyogenic Granuloma**: Could present similarly but tends to be a solitary lesion rather than multiple widespread papules.
6. **Mastocytosis (cutaneous)**: Can present with red papules, but usually has associated symptoms like Darier's sign which are not described.
7. **Spitz Nevus**: Typically presents as a solitary lesion, not widespread multiple lesions.
8. **Tuberous Sclerosis Complex**: Often involves other systems and has a broader range of cutaneous manifestations.
9. **Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome**: Unlikely given the nature and distribution of the lesions described.
10. **Nevus Sebaceous**: Usually present at birth but manifests as a solitary lesion rather than multiple widespread papules and plaques.

### INPUT:
A 28-year-old White woman with no remarkable medical history presented with difficulty phonating and singing for the past 15 months. She also reported odynophonia, globus sensation, and mild dysphagia to solids. The patient had been treated previously with steroids and amoxicillin for the presumptive diagnosis of chronic laryngitis but reported no improvement in symptoms. Laboratory workup was positive for elevated antinuclear antibodies and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and was consequently referred to our institution. On presentation, the patient had only minimal dysphonia. She underwent a transnasal flexible laryngoscopy that demonstrated a severely edematous epiglottis, posterior pharyngeal wall, aryepiglottic folds, and arytenoids (Figure, A). The vocal folds were difficult to visualize but seemed normal in appearance and mobility. Stroboscopy could not be performed because of obstruction from the prolapsing arytenoids. Interestingly, the patient denied any shortness of breath. Results of laboratory testing revealed normal levels of all components of a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. The patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated to 75 mm/h (reference range, 0-15 mm/h). Findings of chest radiography were normal. An esophagram showed no evidence of reflux esophagitis and a computed tomography of the neck showed edema of the supraglottis with some edema in the posterior hypopharyngeal wall.

10. **Mycosis (e.g., fungal laryngitis)**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on Complete Patient Information and Test Results
1. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - Given the elevated antinuclear antibodies and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, autoimmune etiology such as SLE is a primary consideration.
2. **Sarcoidosis** - Considering the elevated ESR and edematous supraglottic findings.
3. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)** - Pulmonary involvement could be absent, but systemic inflammatory markers point towards this differential.
4. **Amyloidosis** - Edema and involvement of multiple structures suggest amyloidosis should be considered.
5. **Relapsing Polychondritis** - Chronic, relapsing nature of the symptoms involving cartilaginous structures.
6. **Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP)** - Although viral in origin, persistent and recurring edema can mimic some autoimmune conditions.
7. **Mycosis (e.g., fungal laryngitis)** - Less likely without symptoms of immunosuppression, but chronicity supports consideration.
8. **Laryngeal Cancer** - Typically presents with more severe dysphonia or shortness of breath, but not impossible.
9. **Laryngeal Tuberculosis** - Less likely without clear primary pulmonary tuberculosis.
10. **Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR)** - Unlikely due to normal findings on esophagram and lack of response to conventional treatments.

A 72-year-old homeless man was referred for management of a recurrent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the right temple and brow. On review of history, maxillofacial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast done 5 months prior to presentation showed a 5.9 × 5.3 × 3.7-cm mass centered at the right temple that tracked along the right lateral orbital wall as well as an enhancing right intraparotid lymph node. The patient was lost to follow-up and re-presented 5 months later with an enlarged crusting and ulcerating lesion of the right temple/brow (Figure 1A). On ocular examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/100 OD and 20/125 OS due to cataracts, pupils reacted normally without afferent pupillary defect, and ocular motility was full. He had mild proptosis in the right eye and right lower eyelid retraction. Orbicularis strength was intact and symmetric in both eyes. MRI of the orbits, face, and neck with and without contrast showed a 6.1 × 5.7 × 4.0-cm mass with erosion through the right sphenoid wing, involvement of the lacrimal gland, and abutment of the lateral rectus (Figure 1B). In discussing treatment strategies for the orbital component of the disease, the patient was strongly against an orbital exenteration.

8. **Chronic Inflammation or Granulomatous Disease (e.g., Sarcoidosis)**
9. **Orbital Pseudotumor (Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome)**
10. **Pleomorphic Adenoma of Lacrimal Gland**

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Recurrent Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**
   - Given the history and the description of the lesion, SCC is the most likely diagnosis.
   
2. **Metastasis from Distant Primary Tumor**
   - The invasion into surrounding structures including bone and lacrimal gland, and lack of recent follow-ups could suggest an aggressive metastasis.

3. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**
   - BCC can present with similar features but less likely due to aggressive nature described.
   
4. **Lymphoma**
   - Lymphoma could present as a rapidly growing orbital mass, although primary SCC history makes it less likely.
   
5. **Malignant Melanoma**
   - Unlikely given the consistency of previous SCC diagnosis but should be considered in the differential.
   
6. **Chronic Inflammation or Granulomatous Disease (e.g., Sarcoidosis)**
   - Sarcoidosis could cause chronic inflammation but is less likely given the aggressive nature of the lesion described.
   
7. **Orbital Cellulitis**
   - Usually more acute and less relevant given history but can be considered due to infection risk.
   
8. **Pleomorphic Adenoma of Lacrimal Gland**
   - Unlikely given patient age, history of SCC, and aggressive invasion.
   
9. **Mucocele**
   - More likely in younger age groups and presents differently.
   
10. **Orbital Pseudotumor (Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome)**
    - Although presents similarly, less likely in the presence of an SCC history.

An otherwise healthy man in his 60s presented to our department with an 8-month history of widespread pruritic papulonodular skin lesions on his extremities and trunk. The patient had been initially diagnosed with nodular prurigo at a local hospital and treated with various topical steroids and oral antihistamines for 2 months, without significant improvement. The skin lesions continued to progress and worsened after scratching. Physical examinations revealed disseminated erythematous papules, hypertrophic plaques approximately 1 to 2 cm in diameter, and dome-shaped nodules with excoriated whitish or pink centers on the scalp, chest, abdomen, back, waist, and extremities (Figure, A and B). Subsequent examinations of the mucosal membranes appeared normal. Other physical examinations as well as his medical and family histories were unremarkable. Peripheral eosinophils, serum total immunoglobulin E level, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for HIV, and results of other routine laboratory tests were within normal ranges or negative. A biopsy specimen was taken from one of the skin lesions on his right forearm for histopathological examination and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) testing (Figure, C and D).

1. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)**: Given the non-response to typical treatments for more common skin conditions, the biopsy, and the chronic nature, this becomes highly suspicious.
2. **Prurigo Nodularis**: Chronic condition with similar clinical presentation, though less likely given the detailed histopathological review and no mention of typical features like neuronal hyperplasia.
3. **Bullous Pemphigoid**: The chronic pruritic nature fits, though the directly observed lesions and normal DIF make this less likely.
4. **Lichen Planus**: Considered due to pruritic papulonodular lesions, although typically more purple and often affects mucosal membranes.
5. **Psoriasis**: Could present with plaques but less likely to cause nodules and more likely to show typical silvery scaling with a clearer history.
6. **Dermatofibroma**: Often occurs as single lesions, not widespread pruritic lesions.
7. **Systemic Mastocytosis**: A consideration for pruritus and histopathological review would help rule it out.
8. **Hypereosinophilic Syndrome**: Peripheral eosinophils are typically elevated, hence not likely.
9. **Scabies**: It could be a differential for pruritus, yet the chronicity and widespread nodules don’t fit well without typical signs and relevant contact history.
10. **Nodular Prurigo**: Initially diagnosed as such but the non-response to treatment and exacerbations post-scratching further move this down the list.

The above re-ranking takes into account all clinical, histopathological, and laboratory findings to narrow down the most possible diagnosis.","['Dermatology', 'Geriatrics']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,60.0,M

### INPUT:
A 37-year-old Asian nonsmoking man with no known medical or drug history presented with an insidious onset of left-eye ptosis (only brought to attention by his friends on review of recent photographs) and subsequent painless vertical diplopia for 1 year. He did not complain of headaches, facial numbness, dysarthria, facial droop, dysphagia, or limb weakness or numbness. There was no history of joint pain or constitutional symptoms. Neurological examination revealed a nonfatigable partial left-eyelid ptosis, left-eye hypotropia at primary position, and impaired left eye supraduction (Figure 1) with a nonreactive left pupil on direct and consensual light reflexes. There were no other cranial nerve deficits. Limb reflexes, motor testing, and sensory testing results were normal, and the plantar responses were flexor. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Neurovascular conflict of the oculomotor nerve,"### 10-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Myasthenia Gravis**  
   - Given the ptosis and diplopia, myasthenia gravis is a primary consideration, especially with ocular manifestations of muscle weakness.

2. **Third Nerve Palsy**  
   - The impaired supraduction and non-reactive pupil suggest involvement of cranial nerve III, which can cause ptosis and other ocular motor deficits.

3. **Horner’s Syndrome**  
   - This syndrome can present with ptosis and anisocoria; however, it typically includes miosis rather than a non-reactive pupil.

4. **Thyroid Eye Disease**  
   - Thyroid eye disease often presents with ocular motility issues and ptosis, although typically in conjunction with other signs of thyroid dysfunction.

5. **Orbital Mass or Tumor**  
   - Orbital masses or tumors can cause ptosis and diplopia through mechanical compression or invasion of ocular structures.

6. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome**  
   - This syndrome is associated with painful ophthalmoplegia and can affect cranial nerves, potentially explaining ptosis and diplopia, although pain is typically present.

7. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)**  
   - CPEO can present with progressive ptosis and ophthalmoplegia without systemic symptoms but typically does not present with pupillary abnormalities.

8. **Diabetic Neuropathy**  
   - Diabetic neuropathy can result in cranial nerve palsies, including the third nerve, causing ptosis and ocular dysmotility.

9. **Cavernous Sinus Syndrome**  
   - Involvement of multiple cranial nerves running through the cavernous sinus can lead to ptosis, diplopia, and pupillary abnormalities.

10. **Multiple Sclerosis**  
    - MS can present with ocular motor deficits, but it's less likely with no systemic or neurological evidence and a chronic presentation over years.

### Re-ranking All Differential Diagnoses Using Complete Patient Information:

1. **Third Nerve Palsy**  
   - The combination of ptosis, diplopia, impaired supraduction, and a non-reactive pupil strongly suggests third nerve involvement.

2. **Orbital Mass or Tumor**  
   - Mass effect in the orbit could explain the mechanical ptosis and diplopia along with the pupillary involvement.

3. **Cavernous Sinus Syndrome**  
   - Multiple cranial nerve involvements due to cavernous sinus pathology fit well, especially with the presentation of diplopia and pupillary issues.

4. **Myasthenia Gravis**  
   - Ocular myasthenia still remains a strong contender, though the non-reactive pupil is less typical.

5. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)**  
   - This diagnosis can account for the chronicity and ophthalmoplegia; however, it usually does not involve pupillary reaction abnormalities.

6. **Horner’s Syndrome**  
   - Although usually presenting with miosis, the ptosis and anisocoria warrant consideration, albeit less likely.

7. **Thyroid Eye Disease**  
   - Important to rule out but less likely without systemic thyroid symptoms or signs, and due to the characteristic non-reactive pupil.

8. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome**  
   - Would need to confirm with imaging or other clinical signs due to the generally painful nature of this condition.

9. **Diabetic Neuropathy**  
   - Absence of diabetes and related symptoms reduces the likelihood significantly.

10. **Multiple Sclerosis**  
    - Despite the chronicity, the absence of systemic or additional neurological signs makes MS less likely.

Next steps would involve imaging (MRI brain/orbits), blood tests for autoimmune and thyroid diseases, and potentially a Tensilon test or other studies to support or eliminate these diagnoses.",['Neurology'],1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,37.0,M

### INPUT:
A 15-year-old girl presented to the otorhinolaryngologic department for a right-side postauricular mass. The mass had been present since birth but had slowly grown larger in the previous 2 years. On physical examination, a 2.5 × 1.5-cm, nontender, blue, soft, cystic mass was observed in the right postauricular area. There were no fistular openings around the auricle or in the external auditory canal (EAC), and there were no additional cysts, sinuses, or fistulas at the right neck from the hyoid bone and chin to the EAC. On temporal bone computed tomography, a 2.5 × 1.5-cm, hypodense, oval-shaped cystic mass was revealed at the subcutaneous fat layer superoposterior to the right auricle. On temporal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an oval cystic mass was revealed at the same location, with high signal intensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and low signal intensity on enhanced T1-weighted fat suppression and T2-weighted short T1 inversion recovery images (Figure, A-D). In surgery, the well-demarcated cystic mass was completely excised. Yellowish fluid leaked out of the cyst during excision. On histopathologic examination, the cyst was lined by keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium with hair follicles and sebaceous glands. The cyst contained keratinous debris (Figure, E). There was no recurrence 6 months after surgery. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Type 1 first branchial cleft cyst,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Epidermoid Cyst**
   - Given the cystic nature, location, presence since birth, and histopathologic features.

2. **Dermoid Cyst**
   - Common congenital cyst, typically found in similar locations, lined by squamous epithelium, and containing adnexal structures.

3. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**
   - Cystic masses often found in the cervical area.

4. **Sebaceous Cyst**
   - Cutaneous cysts filled with keratinous debris; more common in locations with sebaceous glands, which aligns with the histopathologic findings.

5. **Congenital Cholesteatoma**
   - Congenital cystic mass with keratinizing epithelium, often found near the ear.

6. **Preauricular Sinus**
   - Frequently found as congenital anomalies near the ear, though typically with fistular openings.

7. **Lymphangioma**
   - Cystic mass filled with lymphatic fluid, can be congenital, but usually doesn't have the histopathologic features as noted.

8. **Teratoma**
   - Congenital tumors containing various tissue types, but less localized and distinct histologically.

9. **Hemangioma**
   - Soft, blue, vascular lesions, but the histologic findings don't match.

10. **Parotid Gland Cyst**
   - Cystic lesion in proximity to the auricle, though typically not presenting since birth.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on Full Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Dermoid Cyst**
   - Most consistent with the histologic features (keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium with hair follicles and sebaceous glands), location, and presentation.

2. **Epidermoid Cyst**
   - Similar histologic features, though typically lacks adnexal structures (hair follicles, sebaceous glands).

3. **Sebaceous Cyst**
   - Contains keratinous debris and located in the skin, but usually has a different clinical course.

4. **Congenital Cholesteatoma**
   - Includes keratinizing epithelium; however, exact histological match and presentation details less fitting compared to dermoid cyst.

5. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**
   - Less likely due to the exact location and histopathologic findings.

6. **Lymphangioma**
   - Characteristics (e.g., fluid-filled) differ, though could appear cystic.

7. **Teratoma**
   - Diverse tissue types presence; less likely based on histologic examination and presentation.

8. **Preauricular Sinus**
   - Typically presents with sinus tract openings that were not observed.

9. **Hemangioma**
   - Blue mass fits visually, but histopathologically incompatible.

10. **Parotid Gland Cyst**
   - Proximity possible but usually does not match histological and clinical presentation since birth.

In conclusion, **dermoid cyst** is the most likely diagnosis based on a comprehensive evaluation of the patient’s history, physical examination, imaging findings, surgical notes, and histopathologic examination.","['Otolaryngology', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine', 'Pediatrics']",0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,15.0,F

### INPUT:
A 6-month-old girl presented to the emergency department for evaluation of fever and was noted to have mild inspiratory stridor. Her parents stated that her stridor began acutely at 4 months of age without any inciting illness or event. The stridor was worse with agitation but was without positional exacerbation. The family reported that the stridor had remained stable since onset. Her parents noted mild dysphagia but denied shortness of breath, cyanosis, or apnea. Laboratory test results revealed acute COVID-19 infection. Physical examination was unremarkable other than mild inspiratory stridor. Findings from bedside flexible laryngoscopy revealed intact vocal fold motion bilaterally with glottic competence. No supraglottic or glottic masses were identified. Anterior-posterior neck and chest radiography demonstrated narrowing and tortuosity of the trachea with displacement to the right proximal to the thoracic inlet and diffuse patchy heterogenous airspace opacities (Figure, A). Subsequent neck ultrasonography and computed tomography scan demonstrated a 3.2 × 2.0-cm low-density lesion abutting the trachea and hypopharynx at the level of thoracic inlet, with rightward displacement of the trachea and larynx (Figure, B-D). Operative laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, and esophagoscopy revealed extrinsic compression of the trachea, right mainstem bronchus, and esophagus with rightward deviation of the trachea and esophagus. No mucosal tract was identified.

5. **Tracheal Compression by Thyroid Mass**
6. **Bronchogenic Cyst**
7. **Double Aortic Arch**
8. **Cystic Hygroma**
9. **Neuroblastoma**
10. **Mediastinal Teratoma**

### Re-ranking with All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Vascular Ring** - Likely given the imaging findings of tracheal displacement.
2. **Bronchogenic Cyst** - A well-placed contender for producing extrinsic compression.
3. **Congenital Neck Mass** - Could account for displacement seen in imaging.
4. **Double Aortic Arch** - Known for causing vascular compression.
5. **Cystic Hygroma** - Fits the description of a low-density lesion near the trachea.
6. **Neuroblastoma** - Quite possible, often presents as a posterior mediastinal mass.
7. **Mediastinal Teratoma** - Can cause similar compressive symptoms.
8. **Subglottic Stenosis** - Less likely due to lack of positional exacerbation and imaging.
9. **Laryngomalacia** - Typically more common, but less likely due to imaging findings.
10. **Tracheal Compression by Thyroid Mass** - Unlikely in a 6-month-old but still possible.

### Analysis:

Considering the acute and stable nature of the stridor, imaging showing tracheal displacement, rightward deviation, and the extrinsic compression described during endoscopic evaluation, the most convincing diagnosis is a **Vascular Ring**. The other differentials are also valid but less likely given the specific characteristics of this case.","['Pediatrics', 'Otolaryngology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0.5,F

### INPUT:
A 66-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis B infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presented with subacute epigastric pain. Three years prior, she was diagnosed with a solitary HCC and underwent surgical resection with curative intent. Pathology revealed poorly differentiated HCC, 16 cm in largest dimension, with large vein involvement (T3bNXM0, R0 resection). The patient underwent expectant observation. One and a half years prior to the current presentation, laboratory results revealed an elevated α-fetoprotein (AFP), and cross-sectional imaging revealed multiple lung nodules consistent with metastases. She was treated with nivolumab every other week and attained a biochemical (baseline, 212.2 ng/dL; best response, 3.3 ng/dL) and radiographic complete response. In the current presentation, the patient reported nonradiating epigastric pain of moderate intensity for 1 month. Associated symptoms included nausea, anorexia, and water brash without emesis. Review of systems was positive for unchanged chronic abdominal bloating and negative for other constitutional or gastrointestinal symptoms. Laboratory results, including liver function tests, amylase, lipase, and AFP, were within normal limits, and hepatitis B virus polymerase chain reaction was undetectable. Computed tomography with multiphasic liver protocol showed new enlarged mesenteric nodes and diffuse thickening of the gastric body (Figure, A). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) identified diffuse inflammation and ulcerations in the gastric body and antrum (Figure, B). Biopsy specimens showed chronic and active mixed inflammatory infiltrate, including intraepithelial lymphocytosis (Figure, C). No overt viral cytopathic effects were observed, and immunostaining results for Helicobacter pylori, cytomegalovirus, and adenovirus were negative. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Immunotherapy-related gastritis,"Let's go through a differential diagnosis process step by step using the information provided.

**Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) with Gastric Metastasis** 
2. **Primary Gastric Cancer**
3. **Medication-Induced Gastric Inflammation (e.g., Nivolumab-associated gastritis)**
4. **Chronic Gastritis (e.g., due to autoimmune or other non-infectious causes)**
5. **Gastric Lymphoma**
6. **Peptic Ulcer Disease**
7. **Crohn's Disease (Gastric involvement)**
8. **Eosinophilic Gastritis**
9. **Ménétrier's Disease**
10. **Gastric Sarcoidosis**

Now, based on the additional patient information and test results, let's rerank the differential diagnoses considering all the patient information:

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Medication-Induced Gastric Inflammation**:
   - Given the patient's history of recent immunotherapy (nivolumab) and the presence of diffuse gastric inflammation and ulcerations without another clear cause.

2. **Chronic Gastritis**:
   - The biopsy showing chronic and active mixed inflammatory infiltrate points towards chronic gastritis, which can occur without infection.

3. **Primary Gastric Cancer**:
   - Needs to be considered given the gastric findings and the diffuse thickening of the gastric body on imaging.

4. **Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) with Gastric Metastasis**:
   - Although recurrence typically would be in liver/lungs, need consideration due to patient's history.

5. **Peptic Ulcer Disease**:
   - Although less likely as no causes like H. pylori or NSAID use identified, the symptoms and EGD findings make it plausible.

6. **Eosinophilic Gastritis**:
   - Could cause the described inflammation though it typically shows significant eosinophilia.

7. **Gastric Lymphoma**:
   - Possible given the lymphocytic infiltrate, although no evidence of significantly abnormal lymph nodes on other evaluations.

8. **Crohn's Disease (Gastric involvement)**:
   - Could explain mixed inflammatory infiltrate and ulcerations but less likely for primary presentation in a 66-year-old with this history.

9. **Ménétrier's Disease**:
   - Characterized by thickening of the gastric body but more often associated with protein-losing enteropathy and large gastric folds rather than diffuse inflammation.

10. **Gastric Sarcoidosis**:
    - Rare but possible, would expect non-caseating granulomas which were not observed in biopsy specimens.

### Summary:
The most likely diagnosis considering the patient's current presentation, ongoing medication, biopsy results, and imaging is **Medication-Induced Gastric Inflammation** due to nivolumab.","['Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology', 'Hepatobiliary Disease', 'Adverse Drug Events', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology', 'Targeted and Immune Therapy']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,66.0,F

### INPUT:
A 65-year-old patient was referred to the ear, nose, and throat department with left-sided hearing loss during the past 6 months without evident cause. He had a medical history of myocardial infarction, sleep apnea, Ménière disease, and congenital cataract. Furthermore, he did not report otalgia, otorrhea, a recent episode of Ménière disease, or other ear, nose, and throat or systemic symptoms. The patient used atorvastatin and acetylsalicylic acid, did not smoke, and reported drinking 2 glasses of wine daily. Otoscopy of the left ear revealed a yellow-whitish calcareous lobular mass located in the mesotympanum anterior to the malleus with an intact tympanic membrane. The lesion was hard and painful during palpation (Figure 1A). Otoscopy results for the right side were normal. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Tophaceous gout,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Cholesteatoma**  
   - Cholesteatoma can present with chronic ear issues, conductive hearing loss, and otoscopic findings of a mass in the middle ear.

2. **Otosclerosis**
   - Otosclerosis, a disorder involving abnormal bone growth in the middle ear, can cause conductive hearing loss without significant pain or drainage.

3. **Tympanosclerosis**
   - Tympanosclerosis can result in hearing loss due to calcified plaques in the tympanic membrane or middle ear structures, consistent with a hard, calcareous mass.

4. **Glomus Tumor (Paraganglioma)**
   - A glomus tumor in the middle ear can cause hearing loss and a mass that may appear in otoscopic examination but is not typically painful.

5. **Middle Ear Adenoma**
   - This benign tumor can present with hearing loss and an otoscopic view of a mass, though they are usually non-specific in appearance.

6. **Temporal Bone Osteoma**
   - Osteomas can develop in the external auditory canal or middle ear, presenting as a hard mass causing hearing loss.

7. **Schwannoma**
   - A schwannoma affecting cranial nerves in the vicinity of the ear can present with hearing loss and may be seen as a mass in otoscopic examination.

8. **Eustachian Tube Dysfunction**
   - Although it typically would not present with a visible mass, it could contribute to hearing issues and needs exclusion.

9. **Middle Ear Carcinoma**
   - Malignancy must be considered in the presence of a persistent middle ear mass, which could cause hearing loss and be painful.

10. **Autoimmune Inner Ear Disease**
    - This can cause progressive hearing loss, with or without otoscopic findings, warranting consideration despite less common presentation of a palpable mass.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:
Based on the patient’s history, symptoms, and otoscopy findings (yellow-whitish calcareous lobular mass in the mesotympanum, painful on palpation):

1. **Tympanosclerosis**
   - The description of a hard, calcareous mass is most strongly indicative of tympanosclerosis.

2. **Cholesteatoma**
   - The appearance of the mass and hearing loss are suggestive, though the lack of recurrent ear infections or drainage is atypical.

3. **Middle Ear Carcinoma**
   - The painful nature of the mass raises concerns for malignancy requiring urgent exclusion.

4. **Otosclerosis**
   - Although typically painless and without visible mass, it remains in consideration for hearing loss.

5. **Glomus Tumor (Paraganglioma)**
   - The mass and hearing loss are consistent, though ear pain is not a typical presenting symptom.

6. **Temporal Bone Osteoma**
   - The hard, painless mass is consistent but less likely given location-specific descriptors.

7. **Middle Ear Adenoma**
   - Consistent with the presentation of a mass but less likely due to the calcified description.

8. **Schwannoma**
   - A possibility given the mass and hearing loss, but it is less likely to be hard and calcareous.

9. **Autoimmune Inner Ear Disease**
   - Although progressive hearing loss is involved, the lack of otoscopic findings significantly lowers its likelihood.

10. **Eustachian Tube Dysfunction**
    - Least likely given the otoscopic findings and specific presentation of the mass.","['Otolaryngology', 'Rheumatology', 'Otology', 'Audiology and Hearing']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,65.0,M

### INPUT:
A 59-year-old woman with a 5-year history of intermittent bilateral uveitis and scleritis presented with painful left uveitis and an episcleral nodule (Figure 1). Ultrasound biomicroscopy revealed an elevated and tender uveal-episcleral lesion. Visual acuity was 20/30 in the left eye and 20/25 in the right eye. She had been taking 60 mg of oral prednisone; topical prednisolone acetate, 1%; and oral ibuprofen for 10 days without relief. She was suspected of being a steroid responder due to elevated intraocular pressure bilaterally. Three years prior, sinus pressure symptoms led to magnetic resonance imaging that revealed a nasal sinus mass. Biopsy demonstrated a histiocytic infiltrate with emperipolesis, consistent with Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes (RDD) disease. Timolol-dorzolamide topical drops were initiated. Staging evaluations showed no other sites of RDD disease. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Episcleral-uveal nodule and uveitis associated with histiocytosis,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps

**Step 1: Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes (RDD) Disease**  
Given the patient's history, RDD should be the top consideration due to the characteristic histiocytic infiltrate with emperipolesis and the presence of a sinus mass three years prior.

**Step 2: Sarcoidosis**  
Sarcoidosis can also present with uveitis and scleritis. It is a multi-system disease that could manifest similarly.

**Step 3: Tuberculosis (TB)**  
Ocular TB could present with uveitis, scleritis, and even nodules, particularly in immunosuppressed individuals.

**Step 4: Behçet's Disease**  
This condition can cause recurrent uveitis and painful eye nodules, along with other systemic signs.

**Step 5: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**  
SLE can present with various ocular manifestations like uveitis and episcleritis.

**Step 6: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)**  
While more common in children, adult cases of JIA may present with similar eye symptoms.

**Step 7: Syphilis**  
Ocular syphilis can present with uveitis and should be considered, especially in areas with a high prevalence of syphilis.

**Step 8: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Disease**  
VKH disease involves bilateral uveitis and other systemic symptoms, particularly in individuals of certain ethnic backgrounds.

**Step 9: Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)**  
GPA can present with ocular manifestations such as scleritis and uveitis, along with systemic vasculitis.

**Step 10: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)**  
RA can exhibit extra-articular manifestations including ocular inflammation like uveitis and scleritis.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis using Patient Information and Test Results:

1. Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes (RDD) Disease
2. Sarcoidosis
3. Behçet's Disease
4. Tuberculosis (TB)
5. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
6. Syphilis
7. Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)
8. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Disease
9. Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)
10. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)

### Conclusion:
Based on the overall patient history, clinical presentation, and prior biopsy results, Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes (RDD) disease remains the most likely diagnosis, confirmed by the characteristic histiocytic infiltrate with emperipolesis. Other differentials still need to be considered, particularly if new symptoms develop or if there is no response to current treatments.

### INPUT:
A man in his mid-50s with a history of mitral valve repair presented to the emergency department with complaints of recent-onset palpitation within the last hour. On physical examination, the patient showed a rhythmic tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min and blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a regular tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min; no obvious P waves were recognizable (Figure 1A). The QRS complexes displayed 2 different morphologies occurring with a definite allorhythmic distribution: pairs of beats exhibiting complete right bundle branch block (RBBB) and QRS duration of 140 milliseconds followed by a third beat with normal configuration and QRS duration of 70 milliseconds. This trigeminal variation in intraventricular conduction occurred without any change in cycle length and was maintained. Adenosine administration quickly slowed the ventricular rate allowing recognition of an atrial tachycardia with a rate of 178/min and a 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) ratio (Figure 1B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Atypical atrial flutter with RBBB aberration and conduction improvement every third beat resulting from concealed type I (Wenckebach) second-degree block in the right bundle branch with 3:2 ratio,"Based on the given information, let's step through the differential diagnosis:

1. **Atrial Tachycardia** - Given the atrial tachycardia rate of 178/min with a 2:1 AV ratio observed after adenosine administration.
   
2. **Atrial Flutter** - High atrial rates often around 300 beats/min with regular ventricular rhythms.
   
3. **Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT)** - Given the rapid onset of palpitations and sudden changes in heart rate.
   
4. **Atrial Fibrillation** - Irregularly irregular rhythm, but typically associated with rapid varying ventricular response.
   
5. **Ventricular Tachycardia** - Due to the presence of wide QRS complexes potentially indicating a ventricular origin.
   
6. **AVNRT (Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia)** - A regular narrow complex tachycardia responsive to adenosine.
   
7. **Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia (MAT)** - Varied P wave morphologies and irregular rhythm.
   
8. **Digitalis Toxicity** - Can cause arrhythmias like atrial tachycardia with alternating conduction blocks.
   
9. **Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW)** - Can present with rapid palpitations and bundle branch abnormalities.
   
10. **Sick Sinus Syndrome** - Typically involves tachy-brady syndrome but is less likely with the described rhythm.

#### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
Using all patient information and test results, the differentials are prioritized as follows:

1. **Atrial Tachycardia** - Given confirmed rate and pattern in ECG post-adenosine.
2. **Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT)** - Sudden onset and termination fits well with the clinical picture.
3. **AVNRT** - Regular narrow complex tachycardia responsive to adenosine makes it plausible.
4. **Atrial Flutter** - Can sometimes mimic other forms of SVT but less likely with the described ventricular rates.
5. **Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW)** - Preexisting conduction pathway abnormalities might explain complex QRS morphology.
6. **Atrial Fibrillation** - Less likely here given the regular rhythm.
7. **Ventricular Tachycardia** - Evaluated due to broad QRS complexes but less likely given maintenance of cycle length.

### INPUT:
A 27-year-old White man presented with a recent onset of malaise, chills, night sweats, and sore throat with difficulty swallowing. He also reported redness of his right eye with watery discharge. He developed a skin rash affecting his trunk, limbs, and genitalia within the previous week. His medical history was noncontributory, except for allergic rhinitis, for which he was prescribed fexofenadrine pro re nata. His visual acuity was 6/6 in both eyes. Examination of his right eye revealed erythematous swollen eyelids. A slightly raised dome-shaped umbilicated nodule, of approximately 3 mm, was present on his medial one-third lower eyelid margin, with a similar lesion developing on the corresponding upper eyelid margin (Figure). A vesicular lesion was also present on the caruncle and there was global conjunctival hyperemia, mostly pronounced nasally and around the lesions (Figure, B). There were no signs of corneal involvement, and the anterior chamber was quiet. The left eye was normal. Results of fundus examination in both eyes were normal. No preauricular or submandibular lymph node involvement was noted, but cervical lymph nodes were enlarged. The pharynx was erythematous and swollen with white pus patches. The skin lesions were dome-shaped papules, round, pinkish-white in color, surrounded by an erythematous area. Full blood cell count and tests for HIV, AIDS, and syphilis were ordered. Conjunctival swabs and eyelid vesicle fluid were taken for polymerase chain reaction testing. Swabs of the upper respiratory tract were also taken. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Ocular manifestation of Monkeypox infection,"### Developing a Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Infectious Mononucleosis**:
   Given the patient's sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, and malaise, Infectious Mononucleosis is a potential consideration.

2. **Primary Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection**:
   With the presence of vesicular lesions around the eye and the vesicular lesion on the caruncle, HSV infection remains a plausible hypothesis.

3. **Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) Infection**:
   Given the vesicular nature of the lesions and the involvement of the eye, Varicella-Zoster Virus should be considered.

4. **Coxsackie Virus Infection**:
   Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease often presents with vesicles and can occasionally involve the eye, along with systemic symptoms such as malaise.

5. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome**:
   With mucosal involvement (pharynx) and widespread rash, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome is a consideration although the vesicular lesions are atypical.

6. **Streptococcal Pharyngitis**:
   Erythematous pharynx with white pus patches and systemic symptoms such as chills and malaise point towards Streptococcal Pharyngitis.

7. **Molluscum Contagiosum**:
   The description of dome-shaped umbilicated lesions is classic for Molluscum Contagiosum, especially around the eye.

8. **Kawasaki Disease**:
   Although rare in adults, Kawasaki Disease could present with conjunctival injection, mucosal changes, and rash.

9. **Acute HIV Infection**:
   Given the systemic symptoms and rash, an acute HIV infection could present similarly.

10. **Syphilis (secondary stage)**:
    Considering the rash and systemic symptoms, secondary syphilis could present with these signs.

### Re-ranking Based on Patient's Information and Tests:

1. **Molluscum Contagiosum**:
    The dome-shaped umbilicated nodules are distinctive for this condition, and their description is classic.

2. **Primary Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection**:
    The presence of vesicular lesions on the eyelids and conjunctival involvement supports this diagnosis.

3. **Infectious Mononucleosis**:
    Considering the sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, and malaise, this remains a strong candidate.

4. **Streptococcal Pharyngitis**:
    The erythematous pharynx with white pus patches can point towards this bacterial infection.

5. **Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) Infection**:
    Eye involvement and vesicular lesions are consistent with VZV, requiring differentiation from HSV.

6. **Coxsackie Virus Infection**:
    While having some overlap, the specific vesicular and systemic symptoms make it less likely but still possible.

7. **Syphilis (secondary stage)**:
    Needs ruling out via serological testing, given systemic symptoms and rash.

8. **Acute HIV Infection**:
    The systemic presentation makes it a consideration but less specific compared to other diagnoses.

9. **Kawasaki Disease**:
    Uncommon in this age group but considered due to conjunctival injection and rash.

10. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome**:
    Less likely given the specific nature of the rash and lesions, but not impossible if drug reaction history surfaces.","['Dermatology', 'External Eye Disease', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Ophthalmology', 'Mpox (Monkeypox)']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,27.0,M

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old man with insidious onset of limited mobility of joints visited our clinic for evaluation. Six months prior, he found his palms could not make full contact with each other (the “prayer sign”). He had not been able to fully clench his fists for 2 months or squat for the past 10 days. No erythema, edema, or sclerotic skin plaque had been found on his limbs or trunk. No Raynaud phenomenon had occurred. His medical and family histories were unremarkable. On examination, he showed bilateral limited mobility of interphalangeal (hands), metacarpophalangeal, wrist, interphalangeal (feet), metatarsophalangeal, and ankle joints (Video). No muscular atrophy or sclerodactyly was found. The prayer sign (Figure 1A) and the “groove sign” (Figure 1B) were observed. Blood test results indicated eosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count, 1300 μL; reference, <500μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 31 mm/h; reference, <15 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (CRP, 3.01 mg/dL; reference, <0.8 mg/dL [to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10]). Liver and kidney function tests, creatine kinase level, electrolyte level, thyroid function, globulin concentration, and antinuclear antibody (ANA) level were unremarkable. Electrocardiogram, cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging, and plain radiographs of hands, wrists, feet, and ankles were normal. Nerve conduction studies performed in all 4 limbs were normal. Electromyography (EMG) showed spontaneous activities in muscles of limbs, including fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves (1+ or 2+). Myotonic discharges were seen in bilateral extensor digitorum. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Eosinophilic fasciitis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Eosinophilic Fasciitis**
   - Rationale: Eosinophilia and characteristic ""prayer sign"".

2. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
   - Rationale: Elevated ESR and CRP, though no ANA implies it's less likely.

3. **Rheumatoid Arthritis**
   - Rationale: Bilateral joint involvement and elevated inflammatory markers.

4. **Dermatomyositis**
   - Rationale: Elevated ESR, CRP, and muscle abnormalities seen in EMG.

5. **Scleroderma**
   - Rationale: Limited joint mobility but absence of Raynaud phenomenon makes it less likely.

6. **Polymyositis**
   - Rationale: Muscle involvement and elevated inflammatory markers.

7. **Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD)**
   - Rationale: General characteristics but lacks ANA positivity.

8. **Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA)**
   - Rationale: Eosinophilia and systemic symptoms but lacks pulmonary or neuropathic signs.

9. **Inclusion Body Myositis**
   - Rationale: Muscle involvement; typically more common in older patients.

10. **Hypereosinophilic Syndrome**
    - Rationale: Marked eosinophilia and systemic symptoms.

### Revised Differential Diagnosis Ranking

1. **Eosinophilic Fasciitis**
   - Most fitting due to onset, ""prayer sign,"" eosinophilia, and lack of other systemic involvements.

2. **Rheumatoid Arthritis**
   - Significant due to joint involvement and elevated inflammatory markers but less likely without joint damage on imaging.

3. **Polymyositis**
   - Fits muscle involvements and inflammatory markers, but lack of cutaneous manifestations downgrades likelihood.

4. **Dermatomyositis**
   - Muscle findings on EMG support this but lack of cutaneous involvement like the ""heliotrope rash.""

5. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
   - Elevated ESR and CRP but no ANA reduces likelihood strongly.

6. **Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD)**
   - Broad symptoms could fit, but negative ANA and specific joint/muscle involvement make it less likely.

7. **Inclusion Body Myositis**
   - Muscle involvement presents later in age typically.

8. **Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA)**
   - Eosinophilia fits but lacking respiratory and neuropathic involvement.

9. **Hypereosinophilic Syndrome**
   - High eosinophilia fits, but specific systemic symptoms tie it less to main presentation.

10. **Scleroderma**
    - Limited mobility fits but lacks cutaneous and Raynaud's involvement which are crucial for scleroderma. 

The ranking suggests Eosinophilic Fasciitis is the most likely diagnosis given the combination of symptoms, exam findings, and diagnostic test results.","['Neurology', 'Rheumatology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,31.0,M

### INPUT:
A 21-year-old man was referred to our tertiary care hospital with a congenital left hemifacial weakness and a chronic unilateral left-sided hearing loss that evolved since birth. On audiometry, normal hearing sensitivity in the right ear and a severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss with poor word recognition score in the left ear were noted. On physical examination, the patient presented a grade VI peripheral left facial paralysis. Findings from the rest of the clinical examination were within normal limits. Results of cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and temporal bone computed tomography (CT) revealed a left internal auditory canal mass, measuring 13×12 mm, developed at the expense of nerve VII, with a dilation of the various portions of the facial nerve with extension to its distal branches. It presented a hypointensity on T2, isointensity on T1, and was strongly enhanced after the injection of gadolinium. This mass was responsible for the enlargement of the internal auditory canal and was in close contact with the left middle cerebral fossa, without intraparenchymal extension (Figure 1A and B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Neuromuscular choristoma,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Schwannoma (Acoustic Neuroma)**  
   Reason: The described MRI and CT findings, particularly the location, enhancement pattern, and involvement of cranial nerve VII, are suggestive of a Schwannoma.

2. **Facial Nerve Hemangioma**  
   Reason: Facial nerve hemangiomas can present with similar imaging characteristics as well as facial paralysis and hearing loss.

3. **Congenital Cholesteatoma**  
   Reason: Although rare, congenital cholesteatomas can manifest as masses within the temporal bone and cause conductive or sensorineural hearing loss.

4. **Neurofibroma**  
   Reason: Considering the congenital nature, a neurofibroma involving the facial nerve could be a differential.

5. **Epidermoid Cyst**  
   Reason: Epidermoid cysts can occasionally occur in the cerebellopontine angle and might present similarly on imaging and clinical examination.

6. **Meningioma**  
   Reason: Meningiomas in the cerebellopontine angle region can mimic the imaging characteristics and cause cranial nerve deficits.

7. **Metastatic Disease**  
   Reason: It's less common in a young individual, but metastatic lesions can occasionally present in the internal auditory canal.

8. **Lipoma**  
   Reason: Lipomas can occur in cranial nerves and have specific MRI characteristics; however, they are normally hyperintense on T1.

9. **Glomus Jugulare Tumor**  
   Reason: Although more commonly paragangliomas of the jugular bulb, they can present with extensive involvement of local structures.

10. **Sarcoidosis**  
    Reason: Sarcoidosis can cause granulomatous lesions that affect cranial nerves.

### Reranking of Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Schwannoma (Acoustic Neuroma)**  
   Given the imaging characteristics (T2 hypointensity, T1 isointensity, post-gadolinium enhancement, and enlargement of the internal auditory canal), as well as the clinical presentation of facial paralysis and sensorineural hearing loss, Schwannoma remains the most likely diagnosis.

2. **Facial Nerve Hemangioma**  
   The imaging findings and involvement of the facial nerve pattern also support this diagnosis as a close second.

3. **Neurofibroma**  
   Congenital facial weakness and the location of the mass make neurofibroma a reasonable consideration third.

4. **Meningioma**  
   Given the mass's close contact with the left middle cerebral fossa and strong enhancement, meningioma is a solid fourth consideration.

5. **Congenital Cholesteatoma**  
   Anatomically possible and fits some clinical features; however, it's ranked lower due to the less specific imaging.

6. **Epidermoid Cyst**  
   Potentially considered, but less likely due to the expected different imaging characteristics.

7. **Metastatic Disease**  
   Lower in likelihood given patient's age and lack of primary cancer evidence.

8. **Lipoma**  
   Unlikely due to the T1 isointensity rather than hyperintensity.

9. **Glomus Jugulare Tumor**  
   Anatomical dissimilarity from typical presentation reduces its likelihood.

10. **Sarcoidosis**  
    Although it can affect cranial nerves, sarcoidosis is less likely without systemic symptoms or evidence.

This approach methodically considers the most probable diagnosis based on imaging, clinical presentation, and the rarity or commonality of each condition, ultimately favoring Schwannoma (Acoustic Neuroma) as the leading diagnosis.","['Facial Nerve', 'Facial Plastic Surgery', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Oncology', 'Head and Neck Surgery']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,M

### INPUT:
An 18-year-old woman presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities. At age 4 years, she developed white oral plaques that resolved with oral nystatin. Approximately 6 months later, the oral plaques recurred, her toenails became thickened and yellowed, and red plaques appeared on both feet and lower legs. After 3 months of daily oral itraconazole, her skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities resolved for approximately 1 year. Over the following years, she received intermittent 3- to 6-month courses of daily itraconazole for recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities, which typically recurred within 6 to 12 months of discontinuing itraconazole. Her last dose of itraconazole was approximately 2 years prior to presentation. On physical examination, the patient had white, moist, nonadherent plaques in the oral mucosa and moist red fissures at bilateral oral commissures (Figure, left panel). She also had thickened, yellowed toenails and scaly erythematous plaques on her lower legs and feet bilaterally (Figure, right panel). Results of complete blood cell count with differential were normal, as were results of measurement of serum IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE levels and analysis of CD3, CD4, and CD8 T-cell subsets. Potassium hydroxide wet mount preparation of skin scrapings from the lower extremities demonstrated fungal elements. Fungal culture of the skin scrapings grew Candida albicans. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC),"### Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis (CMC)** - Considering the chronic and recurrent nature of mucosal and nail candidiasis, CMC is highly suspect.
2. **Primary Immunodeficiency (e.g., Common Variable Immunodeficiency, CVID)** - Often presents with frequent infections affecting various systems, though immune measurements here are normal.
3. **Psoriasis** - Can present with nail changes and erythematous plaques, but the primary issue seems to favor fungal involvement.
4. **Atopic Dermatitis** - Consider with recurrent skin involvement, but doesn't typically affect nails or oral mucosa in this pattern.
5. **Lichen Planus** - Known for affecting nails and oral mucosa but lesions described and KOH positivity suggest another cause.
6. **Diabetes Mellitus** - Can predispose to recurrent fungal infections, but no systemic symptoms were indicated in the examination description or lab results.
7. **HIV/AIDS** - Immunocompromised states leading to recurrent infections, but T-cell counts were normal.
8. **Seborrheic Dermatitis** - Although affecting sebaceous-rich areas, it can present with mild recurrent topical fungal infections.
9. **Hyper IgE Syndrome (Job Syndrome)** - Recurrent infections and possibly elevated IgE, though levels here are normal.
10. **Dermatophyte Infection (Tinea)** - For example, Tinea Unguium affecting nails, but fungal culture specifically showed Candida albicans much more than a dermatophyte.

### Steps of Reranking Based on Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis (CMC)** - Most likely due to recurrent mucosal and skin candidiasis.
2. **Primary Immunodeficiency (e.g., Common Variable Immunodeficiency, CVID)** - Recurrent infections, though blood counts and serum levels are normal. CMC itself can occur in the context of primary immunodeficiencies.
3. **Hyper IgE Syndrome (Job Syndrome)** - Considered due to recurrent infections, though not supported by lab values.
4. **Psoriasis** - Complex cases can sometimes confuse but lacks the definitive Candida findings.
5. **Lichen Planus** - Example of conditions affecting the nails and mucosa but usually without such persistent Candida.
6. **Diabetes Mellitus** - Underlying predisposition to fungal infections; however, absence of metabolic indicators.
7. **Dermatophyte Infection (Tinea)** - Dermatophytes could cause similar presentations but KOH confirmed Candida.
8. **HIV/AIDS** - Recurrent infections align with some AIDS presentations, but overall immune function appearing intact.
9. **Seborrheic Dermatitis** - More feasible as a complicating secondary dermatitis than as a primary cause here.
10. **Atopic Dermatitis** - Less likely than other differentials due to nature and localization of infections to oral mucosal and nail.

A man in his 60s with anti-RNA polymerase III antibody–positive systemic sclerosis complicated by scleroderma kidney crisis, heart failure, interstitial lung disease, sclerodactyly, and Raynaud phenomenon while receiving mycophenolate mofetil, 1 g twice daily, presented with a pruritic rash that had been present for 3 months. The patient denied any known preceding triggers or trauma to the area of the rash. He had tried treating with topical aloe, without improvement. Review of systems was negative for any new or worsening constitutional, respiratory, or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient’s medical history was otherwise unremarkable. Examination findings were notable for firm, red-brown plaques without overlying scale on the proximal upper extremities and anterior trunk (Figure, A and B). There was no appreciable skin tightening in the affected areas. Complete blood cell count with differential was unremarkable. Lesional punch biopsy specimens were obtained (Figure, C and D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Keloidal scleroderma,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis
1. **Drug-induced Eruption**: Given the patient's medication (mycophenolate mofetil), which can sometimes cause skin reactions.

2. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma**: Presents with pruritic, red-brown plaques which can be mistaken for other dermatological conditions.

3. **Granuloma Annulare**: Characterized by firm, red-brown plaques typically without scale.

4. **Sarcoidosis**: Can present with erythematous plaques and is common in systemic inflammatory conditions.

5. **Lichen Planus**: Presents as pruritic, violaceous plaques, which can sometimes appear red-brown depending on the chronicity.

6. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica**: Yellow-red plaques typically found on the shins but can occur elsewhere, often associated with diabetes which was not mentioned but possible.

7. **Prurigo Nodularis**: Characterized by pruritic nodular lesions, could be an exaggerated response in a person with systemic sclerosis.

8. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus**: Can have plaques without systemic symptoms and present with firm, red-brown lesions.

9. **Lichen Sclerosus**: Typically associated with white plaques but might present in an early stage as red-brown.

10. **Eosinophilic Fasciitis**: While more often involving the extremities, can present with plaques in systemic sclerosis patients.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis
1. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma**: Firm, red-brown plaques without scale, chronic condition, systemically unremarkable other than systemic sclerosis.
2. **Sarcoidosis**: Erythematous plaques are common, often associated with systemic conditions.
3. **Drug-induced Eruption**: Uncommon with mycophenolate, but any medication can cause reactions.
4. **Granuloma Annulare**: Fits appearance, though typically rings are more common.
5. **Lichen Planus**: Pruritic, and can be red-brown if chronic.
6. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica**: Lesions could fit, usually associated with diabetes.
7. **Prurigo Nodularis**: Pruritic nodules, more common in chronic systemic conditions.
8. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus**: Plaques without other systemic lupus symptoms.
9. **Lichen Sclerosus**: Uncommon, typically white but could present as red-brown early.
10. **Eosinophilic Fasciitis**: Rare, can be related to systemic sclerosis, even if typically involving the fascia more profoundly.

### INPUT:
A patient in their 70s presented to the emergency department (ED) with a unilateral painless right proptosis, first noticed 3 days prior. There was no contributory medical history, recent trauma, or surgery. Visual acuity (VA) was 20/32 OD and 20/20 OS. Anterior-segment and fundus examination results were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits revealed a right retro-orbital hemorrhage. No etiology could be identified on the image. Systemic corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone, 1 mg/kg per day) was prescribed for 48 hours. The proptosis decreased, and the patient was discharged. After 6 months, complete ophthalmologic examination was performed again; VA was 20/20 OU, and there was no remaining proptosis. Two weeks later, the patient presented to the ED for another episode of acute, painless, right proptosis, and the VA had decreased to 20/40 OD. MRI showed a right retrobulbar hemorrhage. Systemic corticosteroid therapy was again prescribed for 48 hours with rapid resolution of the visual impairment but incomplete resolution of the proptosis. One month later, the patient presented to our ophthalmology department. The VA was 20/20 OU, with a persistent, mild, nonreducible, nonpulsatile proptosis unrelated to Valsalva maneuver but associated with extraocular movement limitation in upgaze. A repeated MRI was performed, which showed the following images (Figure 1). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Recurrent retrobulbar hemorrhage owing to an orbital tumor: a primary orbital melanoma.,"Alright, let's consider the differential diagnoses step by step:

1. **Orbital Venous Varix**
2. **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula**
3. **Orbital Tumor (e.g., Lymphoma)**
4. **Orbital Cellulitis**
5. **Thyroid Eye Disease (Graves' Orbitopathy)**
6. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation**
7. **Cavernous Hemangioma**
8. **Orbital Sarcoidosis**
9. **Metastatic Disease**
10. **Orbital Pseudotumor**

Now, let's rerank all 10 differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results:

1. **Orbital Venous Varix** - The episodic nature of the proptosis and the images showing retro-orbital hemorrhage strongly suggest this, as venous varices can bleed and cause such symptoms.
2. **Cavernous Hemangioma** - Slow-growing and can cause proptosis but less likely to present acutely or episodically.
3. **Orbital Tumor (e.g., Lymphoma)** - Persistent non-reducible proptosis and involvement of extraocular movements make a tumor plausible, though the episodic nature of the symptoms is less typical.
4. **Thyroid Eye Disease (Graves' Orbitopathy)** - Common in elderly patients but usually associated with other systemic findings and bilateral manifestations.
5. **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula** - Often presents with pulsatile exophthalmos; however, it can sometimes present atypically.
6. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation** - Can present similarly but typically involves more pain and does not usually cause hemorrhages.
7. **Orbital Pseudotumor** - Similar presentation but usually more painful and would likely have more diffuse edema.
8. **Orbital Sarcoidosis** - Unlikely without systemic involvement or other signs of sarcoidosis.
9. **Metastatic Disease** - Possible but less likely given the episodic nature and absence of systemic signs/symptoms of malignancy.
10. **Orbital Cellulitis** - Unlikely without pain, fever, or redness; very rare to present with proptosis alone.","['Melanoma', 'Intraocular Tumors', 'Ophthalmology', 'Orbit']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,70.0,U

### OUTPUT:
    ",Farber disease (disseminated lipogranuloma),"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML)**
   - Rationale: Presents with subcutaneous nodules in infants, along with other systemic symptoms like decreased activity and developmental delays.

2. **Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)**
   - Rationale: NF1 can present with subcutaneous nodules (neurofibromas), but other hallmark signs like café-au-lait spots are typically considered.

3. **Congenital Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans**
   - Rationale: Presents as subcutaneous nodules, though usually more localized and uncommon in presentation across such varied body parts.

4. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH)**
   - Rationale: Characterized by subcutaneous nodules and can affect multiple systems including the skin.

5. **Rheumatoid Arthritis (Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis)**
   - Rationale: Involves joint deformities and subcutaneous nodules, although rarer in such a young child.

6. **Lipofibromatosis**
   - Rationale: Presents with soft tissue masses from infancy that are non-tender and can be progressive.

7. **Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome**
   - Rationale: Syndrome where subcutaneous nodules are common but often associated with vascular malformations.

8. **Tuberous Sclerosis Complex**
   - Rationale: Known for skin nodules, but typically also presents with other hallmark signs like facial angiofibromas, which need to be assessed.

9. **Mastocytosis**
   - Rationale: Subcutaneous nodule formation with systemic symptoms can be indicative though other symptoms like flushing and gastrointestinal issues are expected.

10. **Infantile Myofibromatosis**
    - Rationale: Common cause of subcutaneous nodules in infants, capable of being widespread, often benign.

### Reranking Differential Diagnosis with Additional Patient Information and Test Results
Given the additional symptoms of decreased oral intake, decreased activity, and delayed motor development, we can rerank our diagnoses considering multisystem involvement:

1. **Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML)**
   - Matches systemic symptoms (like decreased activity) and rapid progression of nodules.
   
2. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH)**
   - Potential for multi-systemic involvement aligns with overall picture and systemic symptoms.
   
3. **Infantile Myofibromatosis**
   - There can be multisystem involvement, although benign, it fits the nodular presentation well.
    
4. **Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)**
   - Though primarily neurocutaneous, systemic features could arise.

5. **Lipofibromatosis**
   - Well for soft tissue involvement, but less likely to impact systemic wellness significantly.

6. **Tuberous Sclerosis Complex**
   - Could greatly affect multiple systems, yet some characteristic lesions might be absent in the description provided.

7. **Mastocytosis**
   - Fits the systemic symptoms potentially, improved diagnostic ranking given systemic nature of some subtypes.

8. **Congenital Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans**
   - Unlikely multiple system involvement, but the nodular manifestation fits.

9. **Rheumatoid Arthritis (Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis)**
   - Joint issues prominent, disenclosed without systemic noted aspects like decreased activity as lead symptom.

10. **Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome**
    - Systemic involvement fit is weak, although nodular examination applies, it's less probable given the syndromic span.

### INPUT:
A 74-year-old woman was referred for evaluation of retinal lesions in her left eye. Her ocular history was notable for recent cataract surgery 5 weeks prior to presentation that was complicated by endophthalmitis. A normal funduscopic examination was documented prior to cataract surgery. At the time of initial presentation to her local retina specialist 1 week following her cataract surgery, the patient had severe pain and redness. Her visual acuity was light perception. An examination revealed a 2-mm hypopyon and dense vitreous haze with no view of the retina. She was treated for presumed endophthalmitis with a vitreous tap and intravitreal injections of vancomycin (1 mg/0.1 mL), ceftazidime (2.2 mg/0.1 mL), and dexamethasone (0.4 mg/0.1 mL). The vitreous sample obtained at the time of treatment grew Staphylococcus caprae susceptible to vancomycin. At time of examination in our clinic 4 weeks following treatment, the patient was receiving topical steroid and cycloplegic drops. Her best-corrected visual acuity had improved to 20/70. Examination showed a deep and quiet anterior chamber with a well-positioned intraocular lens without any plaques or deposits on the lens capsule. Dilated ophthalmoscopic examination demonstrated improvement in the vitreous debris with 1+ vitritis and numerous superficial, round, white lesions spread throughout the fundus in all 4 quadrants and in the macula (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography verified the preretinal location of the lesions (Figure 1B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Vancomycin and ceftazidime deposits,"Alright, let's break down this case with a step-by-step differential diagnosis:

#### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis
1. **Candida Endophthalmitis** - Given the history of endophthalmitis, this can be due to Candida, especially in the context of a patient whose infection might recur or persist despite initial treatment.
   
2. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis** - Immunocompromised patients or those with prior ocular surgery can develop retinitis which can appear as white retinal lesions.

3. **Toxoplasmosis Retinochoroiditis** - This condition can also present with white retinal lesions and a history of prior eye surgery may lead to reactivation in older patients.

4. **Herpetic Retinitis** - This can include both herpes simplex and varicella-zoster virus infections, showing characteristic retinal lesions.

5. **Postoperative Endophthalmitis** - Considering the previous recent history of endophthalmitis, unresolved or recurrent inflammation could cause ongoing retinal changes.

6. **Fungal Endophthalmitis** - Other fungal organisms apart from Candida, such as Aspergillus or Fusarium, could explain persistent intraocular inflammation.

7. **Bacterial Endophthalmitis with Resistant Organism** - A resistant bacterial infection or one that wasn't fully eradicated could present similarly.

8. **Sarcoidosis** - This systemic inflammatory disease can present with granulomatous uveitis and retinal lesions mimicking infectious etiologies.

9. **Syphilitic Uveitis** - Syphilis can cause a range of ocular findings, including retinal lesions; it should not be overlooked especially in atypical presentations.

10. **White Dot Syndromes** (e.g., MEWDS, APMPPE) - These are a group of inflammatory conditions that can present with white retinal lesions.

#### Reranking Differential Diagnosis Using Full Patient Information:
1. **Postoperative Endophthalmitis (Recurrent/Resistant)** - The recent history and presentation strongly suggest this as the primary concern.
2. **Candida Endophthalmitis** - Given the chronicity and the white lesions, a fungal infection like Candida is a strong consideration, especially in a post-surgical context.
3. **Fungal Endophthalmitis (Aspergillus or Fusarium)** - Other fungi should be considered given the presentation and history of endophthalmitis.
4. **Herpetic Retinitis** - The white lesions could be consistent with herpetic eye disease post ocular surgery.
5. **Toxoplasmosis Retinochoroiditis** - A less common but possible cause given the retinal lesion characteristics.
6. **Sarcoidosis** - Though less likely than an infectious process, this systemic condition should still be considered.
7. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis** - Less likely without apparent immunocompromise, but still a differential especially with persistent lesions.
8. **Syphilitic Uveitis** - A less common but systemic infection that should be kept in the differential.
9. **White Dot Syndromes** - Chronic inflammatory retinal conditions like MEWDS are a possible but less likely consideration.
10. **Bacterial Endophthalmitis (Other/Resistant organisms)** - Given treatment with appropriate antibiotics, new bacterial etiologies are less likely, but still on the list for completeness.

**Definitive diagnosis will depend on further clinical tests including microbiological cultures, blood tests, and potentially a repeat ocular biopsy or tap for more accurate identification of the infectious organism or other pathology.**","['Cataract and Other Lens Disorders', 'Ophthalmology', 'Retinal Disorders', 'Antibiotic Use, Overuse, Resistance, Stewardship', 'Infectious Diseases']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,74.0,F

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy 54-year-old woman presented with an erythematous right lower eyelid lesion with a vermiform appearance, accompanied by pruritus and pain (Figure 1A). The lesion resolved after 1 month, but she developed redness and swelling of the inner part of her right conjunctiva the next day (Figure 1B). She denied any vision changes, eye pain, eye discharge, or systemic symptoms, such as fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, or diarrhea. The patient had recently immigrated from rural Moldova 1 month prior to presentation, where she had exposure to farm animals, including dogs and cats. She had not traveled to any other countries. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Ocular dirofilariasis,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:
1. **Dirofilariasis**: Considering the vermiform appearance and the patient's history of exposure to animals in a rural setting.
2. **Toxocariasis**: Due to the potential exposure to contaminated soil through pets.
3. **Cutaneous Larva Migrans**: Based on the exposure to warm, moist environments common in rural settings.
4. **Ocular Larva Migrans**: Given the specific involvement of the eye in a patient exposed to animals.
5. **Leishmaniasis**: Given the recent immigration from an area where Leishmania is endemic and the cutaneous manifestations.
6. **Preseptal Cellulitis**: Due to redness and swelling around the eye.
7. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Keratitis**: Given the localized nature around the eye, though lacking typical systemic herpes symptoms.
8. **Allergic Conjunctivitis**: Although the timeline and exposure history are less typical, swelling and redness around the eye could fit.
9. **Pyogenic Granuloma**: Given the localized lesion and inflammation transitioning to eye involvement.
10. **Orbital Cellulitis**: Severe infection involving the eye area, though less likely without systemic symptoms.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Dirofilariasis**: Leading diagnosis due to vermiform appearance and recent exposure to rural, animal-rich environments.
2. **Ocular Larva Migrans**: A strong candidate due to eye-specific involvement and exposure to animals.
3. **Cutaneous Larva Migrans**: Fits initial presentation and exposure history, though typically migrates through skin rather than resolving without treatment.
4. **Toxocariasis**: A plausible cause related to animal exposure but typically involves systemic symptoms.
5. **Leishmaniasis**: Possible given the geographic history, though usually involves more systemic symptoms.
6. **Preseptal Cellulitis**: Fits the swelling and redness but lacks a vermiform appearance.
7. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Keratitis**: Could be considered despite less typical onset without systemic symptoms.
8. **Orbital Cellulitis**: Unlikely without fever or systemic symptoms, but could manifest from secondary infection.
9. **Allergic Conjunctivitis**: Unlikely without typical allergic history or triggers beyond recent animal exposure.
10. **Pyogenic Granuloma**: Less likely without traumatic history or rapid growth pattern.

### INPUT:
A 79-year-old female patient presented with a 2-year history of asymptomatic erythematous-infiltrated patches and plaques on the right side of her scalp and face. The lesions gradually enlarged and coalesced into large plaques and nodules. Mild erosions occurred occasionally on the surface of the lesions. She denied having fever, fatigue, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. Physical examination demonstrated ill-defined, indurated erythematous-violaceous patches, nodules, and plaques involving the surface of her head and face with sporadic erosion and brownish crusts (Figure, A). The findings of systemic reviews were unremarkable, and there was no lymphadenopathy. The complete blood cell count revealed normal white blood cell count. The biopsy from an erythematous nodule displayed sheets of medium to large mononuclear cells infiltrated in the dermis, some of which filled and expanded apparent dermal blood vessels and had large, irregular, pleomorphic nuclei (Figure, B). In addition, some neoplastic cells formed a balloon appearance. No epidermotrophism was found. The initial immunohistochemical stain revealed the tumor cells were positive for CD3 and negative for CD20, AE1/AE3, CK20, chromogranin A, and melan-A. The Ki-67 labeling index was 70%. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma,"### Differential Diagnosis Process

1. **Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)**  
    - Reasoning: Given the chronicity, localization of the lesions, and immunohistochemical findings (positive CD3, negative CD20), a T-cell lymphoma is highly suggestive.

2. **Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma**  
    - Reasoning: Even though this is less likely due to negative CD20, the appearance of infiltrated patches and plaques along with nodules still warrant consideration.

3. **Angiosarcoma**  
    - Reasoning: The presence of vascular involvement and medium to large cells could initially suggest vascular tumors.

4. **Atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX)**  
    - Reasoning: Infiltrative nature and nodule formation with pleomorphic cells can mimic AFX, although usually confined to the dermis.

5. **Kaposi sarcoma**  
    - Reasoning: The presence of ill-defined, violaceous patches and nodules mimic typical appearances seen in Kaposi sarcoma.

6. **Lupus vulgaris (cutaneous tuberculosis)**  
    - Reasoning: Chronic, enlarging, indurated plaques with occasional erosion resemble cutaneous tuberculosis presentation.

7. **Mycosis fungoides**  
    - Reasoning: As a subtype of CTCL, it typically presents with patches, plaques, and can progress to tumors, and is CD3 positive.

8. **Lymphomatoid papulosis**  
    - Reasoning: Presents as chronic recurring papulonodular lesions that can have atypical histological features.

9. **Cutaneous metastasis of an underlying malignancy**  
    - Reasoning: The involvement of the dermis with abnormal cell infiltrates could signify a primary malignancy elsewhere.

10. **Merkel cell carcinoma**  
    - Reasoning: Rapidly growing, erythematous nodules primarily on sun-exposed areas, despite the immunohistochemical profile being non-confirmative.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)**  
    - Highly consistent with clinical and immunohistochemical findings (CD3 positive, CD20 negative).

2. **Mycosis fungoides**  
    - A specific subtype of CTCL that fits clinical presentation and immunohistochemistry (CD3 positive, pleomorphic cells).

3. **Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma**  
    - Considered due to the possibility of atypical immunohistochemical profiles but CD20 negativity makes it less likely.

4. **Angiosarcoma**  
    - Similar features in terms of vascular involvement but less supported by immunohistochemistry.

5. **Lymphomatoid papulosis**  
    - Shares chronic nature and can present like lymphoma but generally has a more benign course.

6. **Kaposi sarcoma**  
    - Clinical features align but no histochemical support and lack of systemic symptoms mentioned.

7. **Atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX)**  
    - Histopathological appearance can mimic, but typically confined and more superficial without such an indurated presentation.

8. **Cutaneous metastasis of an underlying malignancy**  
    - Always a consideration for unusual skin presentations but less supported here by the immunohistochemistry and history.

9. **Lupus vulgaris (cutaneous tuberculosis)**  
    - Rare and less likely immunohistochemical findings and absence of systemic symptoms.

10. **Merkel cell carcinoma**
    - Considered due to nodules but immunohistochemistry and presentation don't strongly support (negative chromogranin A and CK20).","['Dermatology', 'Oncology', 'Soft-Tissue Tumors', 'Lymphomas']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,79.0,F

### INPUT:
An 11-year-old boy was referred to assess a retinal mass in the left eye found on his first routine ophthalmic evaluation. He reported no present or past ocular symptoms and had negative findings on a review of systems. His history included full-term birth by cesarean delivery from an uncomplicated pregnancy. He had healthy, nonconsanguineous parents. The ocular examination showed a visual acuity of 20/20 OU with no anterior segment abnormalities. Findings of dilated fundus examination of the right eye were within normal limits. In the left eye, a white, translucent solid lesion with calcification was noticeable in the inferonasal quadrant (Figure, A). The lesion measured approximately 1.6 mm in height, exhibited mild underlying chorioretinal changes, and had associated 3 vitreous seeds (Figure, A). There were no signs of internal vascularization or vitritis. Optical coherence tomography confirmed an intraretinal location and calcified deposits within the lesion (Figure, B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Retinoma,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Retinoblastoma**  
    Malignant retinal tumor primarily found in children, characterized by a white retinal mass and possible calcifications.

2. **Coats' Disease**  
    Characterized by abnormal development of retinal blood vessels leading to retinal telangiectasia and potential exudative retinal detachment.

3. **Toxocariasis**  
    Ocular infection caused by Toxocara canis or Toxocara cati, leading to a white retinal granuloma sometimes with calcifications.

4. **Retinal Hemangioblastoma**  
    Vascular tumors of the retina often associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease, but can occur sporadically.

5. **Persistent Fetal Vasculature (PFV)**  
    Remnants of the fetal hyaloid vascular system leading to a range of ocular abnormalities, including retinal masses.

6. **Astrocytic Hamartoma**  
    Benign glial tumors of the retina often associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, appears as white, calcified retinal tumors.

7. **Congenital Hypertrophy of the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (CHRPE)**  
    Non-progressive retinal lesion often discovered incidentally, appearing as a pigmented area rather than white.

8. **Retinal Tubercle**  
    Characteristic of intraocular tuberculosis, appearing as a granulomatous lesion but with possible calcification in chronic cases.

9. **Choroidal Osteoma**  
    Benign ossifying tumor of the choroid which can become calcified over time.

10. **Leukemic Retinopathy**  
    Ocular manifestation of leukemia which can present with retinal infiltrates, possibly with calcification.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Retinoblastoma**  
    - The presenting findings of a white, calcified retinal mass highly favor this diagnosis, especially in a pediatric patient.
  
2. **Astrocytic Hamartoma**  
    - The lesion's calcified nature suggests this possibility, particularly with no systemic symptoms.
  
3. **Retinal Tubercle**  
    - Chronic granulomatous appearance with calcification could suggest TB if there’s a history of TB exposure.
  
4. **Coats' Disease**  
    - The presence of vitreous seeds aligns but lacks the hallmark vascular anomalies and exudation of Coats'.
  
5. **Toxocariasis**  
    - Possible granulomatous lesion with calcification but less likely without ocular inflammation.
  
6. **Choroidal Osteoma**  
    - The location and calcification could fit, but osteomas are less common in children.
  
7. **Retinal Hemangioblastoma**  
    - Sporadic cases may have calcification but these usually present with more pronounced vascular characteristics.
  
8. **Persistent Fetal Vasculature (PFV)**  
    - Can present with retinal mass but typically not calcified.
  
9. **Leukemic Retinopathy**  
    - Unlikely given health history and lack of systemic symptoms.
  
10. **Congenital Hypertrophy of the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (CHRPE)**  
    - Not calcified and typically pigmented, making this an unlikely fit.","['Ophthalmology', 'Pediatrics', 'Retinal Disorders']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,M

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy man in his early 70s presented to the Department of Dermatology with a 2-year history of a mildly pruritic, erythematous, and gradually enlarging lesion on the proximal portion of his left calf. The lesion had appeared without an identifiable cause, and for the previous 2 months, the patient had applied topical corticosteroids and antifungals with no improvement. Physical examination revealed an ill-defined, nonindurated, erythematous-violaceous plaque that was slightly raised but with an atrophic appearance (Figure, A). A skin biopsy was obtained for histopathology examination (Figure, B-D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Poikilodermatous plaque–like hemangioma,"Sure, let's systematically approach this case using a differential diagnosis method. 

1. **Suspected diagnosis: Tinea Corporis (Ringworm)**
   - Reasoning: Pruritic, erythematous lesion; however, no improvement with antifungal treatment.

2. **Stasis Dermatitis:**
   - Reasoning: Chronic, erythematous lesion in an elderly patient that hasn't responded to topical corticosteroids.

3. **Nummular Eczema:**
   - Reasoning: Chronic, coin-shaped patches, pruritic condition.

4. **Psoriasis:**
   - Reasoning: Chronic, erythematous plaque with possible scaling, not responding to corticosteroids.

5. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL):**
   - Reasoning: Chronic, erythematous to violaceous plaques; typically affects the elderly.

6. **Lichen Planus:**
   - Reasoning: Erythematous-violaceous lesions, chronic condition.

7. **Fixed Drug Eruption:**
   - Reasoning: Violaceous, recurrent lesions associated with medication intake.

8. **Actinic Keratosis:**
   - Reasoning: Precancerous, erythematous lesions common in elderly patients.

9. **Sarcoidosis:**
   - Reasoning: A chronic inflammatory disease that can produce erythematous-violaceous plaques.

10. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus:**
    - Reasoning: Erythematous, chronic plaques that can be atrophic and occasionally pruritic.

### Reranking After Considering Histopathology, Patient Information, and Test Results:

1. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL):**
   - Reasoning: Most consistent with a chronic, erythematous to violaceous plaque in an older patient; likely histopathology findings.

2. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus:**
   - Reasoning: Chronic, erythematous plaque with possible atrophy seen under histopathology.

3. **Nummular Eczema:**
   - Reasoning: Chronic, pruritic lesions, if histopathology aligns.

4. **Lichen Planus:**
   - Reasoning: Matches erythematous-violaceous appearance, correct histological findings needed.

5. **Psoriasis:**
   - Reasoning: Psoriasiform histologic features and clinical presentation; however, lack of response to steroids.

6. **Sarcoidosis:**
   - Reasoning: Systemic disease presenting with skin manifestations, histology should confirm granulomas.

7. **Actinic Keratosis:**
   - Reasoning: Less likely as primary consideration given presentation, histology.

8. **Fixed Drug Eruption:**
   - Reasoning: Requires correlation with medication usage and histology.

9. **Tinea Corporis:**
   - Reasoning: Fungal elements on biopsy should negate if negative.

10. **Stasis Dermatitis:**
    - Reasoning: Chronic lesion consistent with venous insufficiency but less typical presentation in location and features.

### INPUT:
A 59-year-old man with history of cutaneous melanoma of the trunk was referred for evaluation of a pigmented angle lesion in the right eye. He denied any changes in vision, flashes, floaters, eye pain, or eye redness. He denied a history of trauma, intraocular surgery, or inflammation in the eyes. He had a history of stage 3B melanoma treated with ipilimumab complicated by grade 3 colitis refractory to high-dose corticosteroids and infliximab requiring colectomy and stomal hernia after hernia repair. Serial positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans showed no evidence of metabolically active disease. His medical history was notable for hypertension controlled with metoprolol. His mother had a history of breast cancer but otherwise family history was unremarkable. Visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg OD and 15 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination showed inferior corneal endothelial pigmentation in the right eye (Figure, A) and trace nuclear sclerotic cataracts in both eyes. He did not have ectropion uvea, corectopia, or feeder vessels. Dilated ophthalmoscopy was unremarkable. Four-mirror gonioscopy in the right eye showed an open angle, normally pigmented trabecular meshwork, and a well-demarcated pigmented brown lesion without extension into the angle (Figure, B). Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) in the right eye was unremarkable and did not show any masses. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Peripheral pigmented placoid corneal endotheliopathy,"Let's evaluate the differential diagnoses step by step, considering the clinical information provided:

1. **Metastatic melanoma** - Given the patient's history of stage 3B melanoma and the presence of a pigmented lesion, this must be considered first.

2. **Primary acquired melanosis (PAM)** - This condition can present with pigmented lesions in the eye and needs to be considered due to its potential for transformation into melanoma.

3. **Nevus of Ota** - A condition characterized by increased pigmentation that could present as a pigmented lesion in the eye.

4. **Ocular melanocytosis** - This condition involves increased melanocytes in the uveal tract and can result in pigmented lesions.

5. **Conjunctival nevus** - One of the common pigmented lesions of the eye, generally benign.

6. **Pigment dispersion syndrome** - Characterized by the dispersion of iris pigment, which could explain the endothelial pigmentation observed.

7. **Iris melanoma** - Although less common without nodular masses seen on UBM, it remains a differential.

8. **Choroidal melanoma** - While primarily involving the posterior segment, peripheral lesions can't be excluded without further investigation.

9. **Ocular melanocytoma** - A benign condition, but rare and still a consideration.

10. **Pigmented basal cell carcinoma** - Rare in intraocular presentation but needs to be considered in differential due to pigmentation and his previous cancer history.

### Re-ranking Based on Patient Information and Test Results:
Considering the clinical details, test results like normal UBM, past medical history, and definite exclusion criteria:

1. **Metastatic melanoma** - Remains the top differential due to the patient's history of cutaneous melanoma and characteristics of the lesion.
2. **Primary acquired melanosis** - Needs high consideration due to potential malignant transformation.
3. **Ocular melanocytosis** - Clinical presentation aligns without showing typical complications of more sinister lesions.
4. **Conjunctival nevus** - Generally more common and benign but fits the description well.
5. **Pigment dispersion syndrome** - Could explain endothelial pigmentation without changes in angle structure.
6. **Nevus of Ota** - Possible but would more likely have additional skin findings.
7. **Iris melanoma** - Lower probability given normal UBM findings.
8. **Choroidal melanoma** - Less likely without posterior involvement or findings on UBM.
9. **Ocular melanocytoma** - Rare and typically easily differentiable.
10. **Pigmented basal cell carcinoma** - Unlikely intraocular presentation.

### INPUT:
A 42-year-old woman with history of a functional pituitary adenoma, breast cancer in remission for which she was undergoing tamoxifen therapy, and prior bilateral laser in situ keratomileusis surgery was referred for evaluation of right lagophthalmos. She reported 2 months of increasing right-sided blurry vision and a sensation of eye dryness. She was found to have incomplete eyelid closure by her primary care physician, who initiated artificial tear lubrication and bedtime eyelid taping with partial symptom improvement. Clinical examination revealed 20/25 visual acuity OD with full extraocular motility and normal intraocular pressure. She was noted to have right upper eyelid retraction (Figure 1A) with substantial static upper eyelid lag on downgaze (Figure 1B). She had 1-mm right lagophthalmos with incomplete blink. Frontalis and orbicularis oculi strength were intact. She was measured to have a 2-mm relative right enophthalmos and no resistance to retropulsion. A review of patient photographs from 2 years prior showed symmetric bilateral eyelid appearance without retraction. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cicatricial upper eyelid retraction from metastatic breast carcinoma,"Sure, to develop a 10-step differential diagnosis, we will begin by taking into account the patient’s presenting features, history, and clinical findings. At each step, the differential diagnosis will be refined.

### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Thyroid Eye Disease (TED)**
   - Basis: Upper eyelid retraction and lagophthalmos are classic features of TED.

2. **Bell’s Palsy**
   - Basis: Lagophthalmos is a common symptom; however, normal facial nerve function is noted, making this less likely.

3. **Graves' Ophthalmopathy**
   - Basis: Thyroid connection with symptoms like eyelid retraction, although no specific thyroid abnormality is documented.

4. **Orbital Tumor**
   - Basis: Enophthalmos and recent onset of symptoms could suggest a space-occupying lesion in the orbit.

5. **Post-LASIK Ectasia**
   - Basis: Previous eye surgery could contribute to changes in eye anatomy, though not typically presenting with such eyelid involvement.

6. **Ptosis due to Cranial Nerve III Palsy**
   - Basis: Palsy of the oculomotor nerve could lead to lid issues but does not align exactly with the clinical findings of normal motility and lid retraction.

7. **Myasthenia Gravis (MG)**
   - Basis: Autoimmune disease affecting ocular muscles could present with similar symptoms, but lacks fluctuating ptosis or variable extraocular muscle involvement here.

8. **Orbital Varix**
   - Basis: Could cause intermittent enophthalmos and changes with Valsalva, but no reported changes in position.

9. **Cavernous Sinus Syndrome**
   - Basis: Involves multiple cranial nerves affected, but no other cranial nerve deficits are observed.

10. **Trauma-related Enophthalmos**
   - Basis: Trauma history leading to chronic or delayed enophthalmos, though no history of trauma is documented.

### Final Ranking of Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Thyroid Eye Disease (TED)**
   - Consistent with eyelid retraction, lagophthalmos, and recent onset.

2. **Graves' Ophthalmopathy**
   - Similar presentation to TED but with more direct thyroid implication.

3. **Orbital Tumor**
   - Needs to be ruled out due to recent onset and enophthalmos.

4. **Bell’s Palsy**
   - Lagophthalmos aligns but is less likely given intact frontal and orbicularis oculi strength.

5. **Myasthenia Gravis (MG)**
   - Potential but less likely given no other varying muscle weakness or signs.

6. **Cavernous Sinus Syndrome**
   - Higher-order diagnosis to consider if additional symptoms emerge.

7. **Post-LASIK Ectasia**
   - Less likely given no corneal or regular anatomical post-LASIK complications noted here.

8. **Orbital Varix**
   - Could still play a role but less likely without characteristic positional changes.

9. **Ptosis due to Cranial Nerve III Palsy**
   - Does not fully explain the clinical findings of lid retraction and normal motility.

10. **Trauma-related Enophthalmos**
    - Unlikely without any trauma history.

She reported no history of travel outside the US and no raw meat ingestion. Her vital signs, mentation, and physical examination were normal except for scleral icterus (Figure). Results of blood testing were negative for hepatitis C virus RNA, anti–hepatitis A IgM, and HIV antibody. Other selected laboratory values are shown in the Table. A liver ultrasound performed 6 months prior to presentation and a repeat liver ultrasound with Doppler revealed no abnormalities. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Hepatitis D superinfection,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps:
1. **Hepatitis E infection** - Based on the sudden onset of jaundice and the exclusion of Hepatitis A, B (chronic inactive), and C.
2. **Drug-induced liver injury (DILI)** - Given the recent history of intravenous heroin use.
3. **Autoimmune hepatitis** - Consideration due to unexplained jaundice and malaise in the absence of other clear etiologies.
4. **Biliary obstruction** - Normally painless jaundice can be associated with biliary tract obstruction.
5. **Acute liver failure from unknown cause** - Given the acute presentation of jaundice.
6. **Wilson’s disease** - Jaundice and liver dysfunction, although less common at this age.
7. **Hemochromatosis** - Iron overload can contribute to liver dysfunction and jaundice.
8. **Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency** - Another cause of liver disease that can present with jaundice.
9. **Ischemic hepatitis** - Sudden onset of liver dysfunction without identifiable cause.
10. **Lymphoma or malignancy** - Possible underlying malignancy causing liver dysfunction.

### Re-Ranked Final Differential Diagnosis List:
1. **Hepatitis E infection** - Given the presence of jaundice and other exclusions, particularly with the history of intravenous drug use, which could increase exposure risk.
2. **Drug-induced liver injury (DILI)** - The timing of symptom onset relative to recent heroin use supports this possibility.
3. **Autoimmune hepatitis** - Should still be considered given the lack of other clear causes.
4. **Biliary obstruction** - Although ultrasound was clear, small stones or other non-visualized obstruction cannot be completely ruled out.
5. **Hemochromatosis** - Given her age; it remains a differential, though less likely without a family history or typical signs.
6. **Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency** - Possible but less likely, as it usually presents in younger patients.
7. **Wilson’s disease** - Uncommon presentation at this age, making it lower on the list.
8. **Ischemic hepatitis** - Usually accompanied by other clinical signs of cardiovascular instability, so less likely here.
9. **Lymphoma or malignancy** - Could explain liver dysfunction, but less likely given normal imaging studies and acute presentation.
10. **Acute liver failure from an unknown cause** - This remains a possibility but is low on the list given the other more likely diagnoses.","['Infectious Diseases', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatobiliary Disease', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology', 'Viral Hepatitis']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,58.0,F

### INPUT:
A 2-month-old, full-term female presented with a left upper neck mass that was first noted at birth. Her parents reported no fevers, constitutional symptoms, or enlargement of the mass. On physical examination, there was a nontender 4-cm mass in the left submandibular region with no overlying skin changes. Ultrasonography results showed an avascular cystic structure with internal debris and a single thin septation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the neck soft tissue revealed a 3-cm low attenuation, nonenhancing, cystic-appearing mass that elevated the submandibular gland to the level of the parapharyngeal fat space with medial extension of the lesion into the tongue musculature. The walls were thin except for mildly thickened capsule along the posterior aspect of the lesion (Figure, A and B). Fluid that aspirated from the cyst was serous, and cytology showed mature and anucleate squamous cells with acute inflammation. The mass returned after 3 weeks. Further analysis 8 months after the initial CT via contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a large, multiseptated cystic structure (Figure, C); the capsule of the wall was mildly thickened and was contrast enhancing. At age 12 months, the mass was excised via neck dissection. A lateral component at the level of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was completely excised. An intraoperative rupture of the thin capsule caused some spillage of cystic contents that were milky white in some areas and mucinous in others.

6. **Infectious Lymphadenitis**
7. **Congenital Muscular Torticollis**
8. **Cystic Hygroma**
9. **Ranula**
10. **Fibrosarcoma**

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses
1. **Cystic Hygroma**: The presence of a multiloculated, cystic mass, avascular on ultrasound, and recurrence fits this diagnosis well.
2. **Lymphatic Malformation (Lymphangioma)**: Similar characteristics to cystic hygroma with septations and avascular cystic structure; presents in infants.
3. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**: Common congenital neck mass but would typically present as an inflamed or infected cyst later.
4. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**: Generally midline and connected to the hyoid; less likely due to submandibular location.
5. **Dermoid Cyst**: Contains squamous cells; typically midline but can present in other areas.
6. **Teratoma**: Contains multiple tissue types; could present similarly, but is often larger with solid components.
7. **Ranula**: Typically found in the floor of the mouth, not submandibular region; can recur.
8. **Infectious Lymphadenitis**: Less likely due to lack of systemic symptoms and afebrile situation.
9. **Congenital Muscular Torticollis**: Presents as a mass within the muscle, not cystic.
10. **Fibrosarcoma**: Rare, solid tumor; cystic characteristics and benign cytology make it less likely. 

By examining the patient’s presentation, location and nature of the mass, imaging results, and cytology findings, the reranking prioritizes cystic and lymphatic malformations while deprioritizing solid and infectious differentials.","['Congenital Defects', 'Otolaryngology', 'Pediatrics', 'Head and Neck Surgery']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1667,F

### INPUT:
A 32-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital for fever, flulike symptoms, and altered mental status developed sudden-onset blurry vision in her right eye. Her history was notable for phthisis in her left eye due to a left orbit clear cell sarcoma with metastatic disease, after surgical excision and radiation, with recent enrollment in a palliative immunotherapy research protocol. After completing 2 days of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and antivirals for presumed septic meningitis, her laboratory and imaging results returned negative and she was transitioned to intravenous methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg). One day later, her mental status improved, and she reported central blurry vision in her right eye. On examination, her visual acuity was 20/40 in this eye, she had normal intraocular pressure, and there was no evidence of anterior chamber or vitreous cells. Dilated fundus examination revealed segmental areas of venous sheathing (Figure 1A) in the right eye and was not possible in the left eye owing to phthisis. An optical coherence tomography scan of the right eye revealed hyperreflective changes along the outer plexiform and outer nuclear layers, small intraretinal cysts, and disruption of the ellipsoid and especially the interdigitation zone (Figure 1B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Atezolizumab-associated retinopathy,"### 10-Step Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Infectious Retinitis**: Could present with acute/subacute visual changes and retinal inflammation.
2. **Optic Neuritis**: Sudden vision changes with possible systemic associations such as autoimmune conditions.
3. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy**: Hyperreflective changes on OCT may suggest this condition, although less common with no acute systemic symptoms.
4. **Retinal Vasculitis**: Possibly linked with autoimmune conditions; venous sheathing noted in fundus could suggest this.
5. **Radiation Retinopathy**: Previous radiation for clear cell sarcoma could result in delayed retinal damage.
6. **Drug-Induced Retinopathy**: Palliative immunotherapy research protocol might involve drugs causing retinal toxicity.
7. **Paraneoplastic Retinopathy**: History of metastatic disease could present with retinopathy due to cancer.
8. **Septic Emboli**: Though septic workup was negative, history raises a differential for small emboli affecting the vision.
9. **Uveitis**: Presenting symptoms, but absence of anterior/posterior chamber cells makes it less likely.
10. **Macular Edema**: Though not highly suggestive, small intraretinal cysts might point towards this.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Radiation Retinopathy**: Given the history of radiation for her metastatic clear cell sarcoma, the presence of venous sheathing aligns strongly with known effects of radiation on retinal vasculature.
2. **Paraneoplastic Retinopathy**: History of metastatic disease and immune response link to visual disturbances.
3. **Retinal Vasculitis**: Venous sheathing and systemic autoimmune presentation can closely match.
4. **Drug-Induced Retinopathy**: Recently enrolled in an immunotherapy protocol; potential side effects include visual disturbances.
5. **Optic Neuritis**: Central vision blurriness and general immune-related background make it possible.
6. **Infectious Retinitis**: Broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals indicate initial concern for infection, but still plausible.
7. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy**: Hyperreflective changes on OCT need consideration, though not a strong fit for systemic presentation.
8. **Uveitis**: Likely overestimated initially due to lack of inflammatory cells found.
9. **Macular Edema**: Considered due to small intraretinal cysts but lacks strong contextual fit.
10. **Septic Emboli**: Very unlikely given the negative septic workup and improvement post-steroids.

### Summary:
Given the alignment of clinical presentation and exam findings with the patient's history of radiation therapy and metastatic disease, **Radiation Retinopathy** and **Paraneoplastic Retinopathy** are the top differentials. Retinal vasculitis and drug-induced retinopathy are also strongly considered due to systemic and medication backgrounds.","['Targeted and Immune Therapy', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Sarcomas', 'Adverse Drug Events']",0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,32.0,F

### INPUT:
An adolescent girl presented with an asymptomatic slightly reddish verrucous plaque on the right temple. The skin lesion was nail sized when first noticed 1½ years earlier, then gradually developed over the 8 months prior to presentation. The patient denied any associated fevers, weight loss, or night sweats. Physical examination revealed a slightly reddish verrucous mass with translucent papules and plaques on the right temple, about 5 cm in diameter, with surface hemorrhagic crust in the side adjacent to right eyebrow arch (Figure, A). The lesion was nontender with no purulent discharge and no severe necrotic changes. There was no hepatosplenomegaly or superficial lymphadenopathy. Laboratory tests, including blood cell counts, urinalysis, and kidney and hepatic panels, revealed no abnormalities. A skin biopsy was performed and submitted for histopathologic analysis (Figure, B-D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Primary cutaneous embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Bowen's Disease (Squamous Cell Carcinoma in situ)** – Considered due to the verrucous plaque with translucent papules, and the gradual development of the lesion.
2. **Verrucous Hemangioma** – Considered because of the reddish nature and verrucous appearance.
3. **Verruca Vulgaris (Common Wart)** – Due to the verrucous surface and the gradual growth of the lesion.
4. **Lymphangioma Circumscriptum** – Evaluated because of the translucent papules.
5. **Nevus Sebaceous** – Considered due to the gradual growth and verrucous appearance of the lesion.
6. **Porokeratosis** – Due to the characteristic verrucous plaque and the chronic nature of the lesion.
7. **Cutaneous Tuberculosis (Lupus Vulgaris)** – Evaluated because of the verrucous plaque and the chronicity of the lesion.
8. **Infectious Granuloma (e.g., Atypical Mycobacterial Infection)** – Due to the chronic lesion with erythematous and verrucous features.
9. **Kaposi's Sarcoma** – Considered because of the reddish plaque and the verrucous nature of the lesion.
10. **Keratoacanthoma** – Evaluated due to the growth over several months and the verrucous appearance.

### Reranking Based on Histopathologic Analysis:

1. **Bowen's Disease (Squamous Cell Carcinoma in situ)** – Histopathology often reveals atypical squamous cells involving the full thickness of the epidermis.
2. **Cutaneous Tuberculosis (Lupus Vulgaris)** – Histopathology showing granulomatous inflammation with caseation necrosis would support this diagnosis.
3. **Infectious Granuloma (e.g., Atypical Mycobacterial Infection)** – Histopathology showing granulomas with or without necrosis would be indicative.
4. **Verrucous Hemangioma** – Histopathology often displays capillary proliferation and dilatation.
5. **Keratoacanthoma** – Histopathology showing a well-differentiated squamous cell tumor that resembles squamous cell carcinoma but with a tendency for spontaneous regression.
6. **Nevus Sebaceous** – Histopathology reveals sebaceous glands, sometimes with secondary benign or malignant tumors.
7. **Lymphangioma Circumscriptum** – Histopathology typically shows dilated lymphatic channels in the dermis.
8. **Porokeratosis** – Histopathology shows the presence of cornoid lamellae.
9. **Kaposi's Sarcoma** – Histopathology usually shows spindle-shaped cells mixed with slit-like vascular spaces.
10. **Verruca Vulgaris (Common Wart)** – Histopathology reveals hyperkeratotic epidermis with papillomatosis and viral cytopathic effect (koilocytosis).

### INPUT:
A man in his 40s with a long-standing history of poorly controlled HIV (multiple treatment lapses, viral load of 22 871 copies/mL 8 months prior to presentation but now undetectable with use of highly active antiretroviral therapy, with a CD4 count of 40 cells/mm3) presented to the emergency department with nausea, abdominal pain, bloody stools, odynophagia, and recurrent oral and perianal ulcers and was found to have pancytopenia and septic shock. During admission in the intensive care unit, treatment with broad-spectrum oral antibiotics for presumed infection and oral fluconazole for thrush led to improvement in the patient’s medical condition, but the ulcers persisted. Dermatology was consulted for input on the cause of the ulcers, which had been ongoing for approximately 6 months prior; individual lesions lasted 1 to 3 weeks before self-resolving. Biopsy of an oral mucosal lesion performed 1 month earlier had shown nonspecific inflammation. Examination revealed exquisitely tender, ovoid, punched-out ulcerations of the inferior lip and scrapeable white plaques on the tongue (Figure, A), right buccal mucosa, and external anal mucosa (Figure, B). A punch biopsy from 1 of the perianal ulcers was performed (Figure, C and D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Epstein-Barr virus–positive mucocutaneous ulcers,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis Process:

1. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Colitis** 
   - Given the patient's history of poorly controlled HIV, low CD4 count, and gastrointestinal symptoms, CMV colitis is a possible infection causing ulcers and inflammation.

2. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection**
   - HSV can cause painful oral and perianal ulcers in immunocompromised patients, such as someone with HIV.

3. **Kaposi Sarcoma (KS)**
   - The presence of mucocutaneous lesions suggests KS, which is common in AIDS patients.

4. **Esophageal Candidiasis**
   - This can cause odynophagia and white plaques in a patient with a history of HIV, particularly given their improvement with fluconazole.

5. **Aphthous Ulcers**
   - Recurrent aphthous ulcers can occur in immunocompromised states and may present with painful oral and anal ulcerations.

6. **Cryptococcosis**
   - Cryptococcus infection can mimic some of these findings, particularly in severely immunocompromised patients.

7. **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)**
   - Though less likely in this context, IBD can present with bloody stools and ulcers.

8. **Drug Reaction**
   - Consider adverse reactions to medications, which can sometimes cause ulceration.

9. **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Infection**
   - EBV can also present with oral lesions, particularly in the context of immunosuppression.

10. **Bacterial Infections (e.g., Mycobacterium avium complex)**
    - MAC can cause GI symptoms and systemic infection in advanced HIV.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Information:

1. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection**
   - Given the clinical presentation of painful oral and perianal ulcers, and the patient's immunocompromised status.

2. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Colitis**
   - With gastrointestinal symptoms, low CD4 count, and a history of HIV, CMV colitis remains a strong contender.

3. **Kaposi Sarcoma (KS)**
   - Mucocutaneous lesions seen in AIDS patients can suggest KS, particularly with the type of ulcerations described.

4. **Esophageal Candidiasis**
   - Improvement with fluconazole and the presence of white plaques are suggestive.

5. **Aphthous Ulcers**
   - Recurrent, painful ulcerations in an immunocompromised patient make this plausible.

6. **Bacterial Infections (e.g., Mycobacterium avium complex)**
   - Although less specific, MAC is possible in advanced immunosuppression.

7. **Cryptococcosis**
   - Given the immunocompromised state and potential for similar symptoms, Cryptococcosis should be considered.

8. **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Infection**
   - With a presentation of oral lesions in an immunocompromised host, EBV infection is possible.

9. **Drug Reaction**
   - Although less likely, adverse drug reactions should still be kept in mind.

10. **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)**
    - Though not typical in this specific context, gastrointestinal symptoms warrant consideration of IBD.","['Dermatology', 'Emergency Medicine', 'HIV', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Critical Care Medicine']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,40.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his early 20s presented with suspected syncope and shaking with no significant medical history. The patient fell asleep and his girlfriend tried to wake him, but he started shaking and slumped over on the ground. He denied confusion afterward but did not feel well with nausea, flushing, chest tightness, and a rapid heart rate. About 10 minutes later, he had a second syncopal episode for 2 to 3 minutes with more than 20 muscle jerks. On presentation at the emergency department, he was afebrile, blood pressure was 120/59 mm Hg, heart rate was 85 beats per min, respiratory rate was 16 breaths per min, and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. His cardiac examination revealed normal heart sounds with no murmurs. The electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed early on arrival in the emergency department (Figure). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 54%, mild right ventricular (RV) dilation (RV diameter, 4.1 cm), and no significant valvular abnormalities. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed no RV abnormalities and qualitatively normal RV function. Neurology consultation was obtained with concern for an epileptic seizure event surrounding the recurrent syncopal episodes. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalogram  were obtained, both of which results were normal. On further questioning, patient reported having a second cousin with sudden cardiac death of uncertain etiology in his early 20s. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Brugada type 1 syndrome with unexplained syncope,"Let's proceed step by step to diagnose the patient's condition, taking into account the presented symptoms, history, and test results.

### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Vasovagal Syncope**
   - The patient presented with syncope triggered by his girlfriend trying to wake him, which could align with vasovagal syncope, a common cause of fainting.

2. **Cardiac Arrhythmia**
   - Given the episodes of syncope and a family history of sudden cardiac death, a cardiac arrhythmia such as Long QT Syndrome or Brugada Syndrome might be considered.

3. **Epileptic Seizure**
   - Despite normal EEG and brain MRI, repetitive shaking and muscle jerks observed during syncope raise the possibility of an epileptic seizure.

4. **Convulsive Syncope**
   - The syncopal episodes followed by more than 20 muscle jerks could indicate convulsive syncope, a form of syncope accompanied by convulsions.

5. **Orthostatic Hypotension**
   - This condition can cause syncope upon standing or changing position quickly, although initial blood pressure readings do not strongly support this diagnosis.

6. **Panic Attack/Anxiety Disorder**
   - The presence of physiological symptoms like chest tightness, rapid heart rate, and nausea may suggest a panic attack or an underlying anxiety disorder.

7. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)**
   - Although echocardiography shows a normal ejection fraction and no significant valvular abnormalities, HCM can sometimes present with syncope and may be missed in initial imaging.

8. **Non-Epileptic Seizures (NES)**
   - These are episodes that look like seizures but are not caused by abnormal brain electrical activity, often related to psychological factors.

9. **Hypoglycemia**
   - Low blood sugar levels can cause syncope and shaking, although the patient did not report symptoms specific to hypoglycemia.

10. **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)**
    - This condition involves abnormal increases in heart rate upon standing and could cause some overlapping symptoms with the patient's presentation.

### Re-ranked Differential Diagnosis using Comprehensive Information:

1. **Cardiac Arrhythmia**
   - Given the family history of sudden cardiac death, this remains a top concern. Further testing like genetic tests for arrhythmia syndromes (e.g., Brugada Syndrome) should be considered.

2. **Convulsive Syncope**
   - The description of syncope with muscle jerks is very suggestive of this condition.

3. **Vasovagal Syncope**
   - Still a strong contender given the situational trigger, though less likely due to recurrent significant episodes.

4. **Non-Epileptic Seizures (NES)**
   - Considered due to the normal EEG and brain MRI, suggesting episodes may be psychogenic.

5. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)**
   - Family history warrants deeper investigation even though initial imaging does not show abnormalities.

6. **Epileptic Seizure**
   - Less likely without EEG or MRI evidence, still needs considering due to repetitive shaking and jerks.

7. **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)**
   - Symptoms align, but the presentation isn’t classic without clear postural changes.

8. **Panic Attack/Anxiety Disorder**
   - Symptoms of chest tightness and rapid heart rate support this diagnosis, though less likely to cause multiple syncopal episodes.

9. **Hypoglycemia**
   - Unlikely given that the patient did not report typical hypoglycemic symptoms and lacks biochemical evidence.

10. **Orthostatic Hypotension**
    - Less likely due to normal blood pressure and the absence of frequent symptomatic postural changes in the patient’s history.

Each step reflects narrowing the diagnosis based on clinical details and results, reinforcing the importance of considering both common and serious conditions early on. Further investigations focused on cardiac arrhythmias appear prudent given the patient's history and symptoms.","['Neurology', 'Cardiology', 'Rhythm Disorders']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,20.0,M

### INPUT:
A 32-year-old Black woman presented with a 1-year history of facial swelling, predominantly in the right preauricular and left submandibular regions. Her symptoms began after relocation to California and occurred more frequently at her home. However, she could not discern any environmental or dietary triggers. She reported pruritus and swelling, which were usually moderate but occasionally severe, prompting several emergency department visits. During an emergency department visit, she was diagnosed with acute parotitis based on clinical and radiographic findings of diffuse gland edema, without salivary stones or masses. Her symptoms responded to oral prednisone bursts and diphenhydramine, but not to second-generation antihistamines or montelukast. Her workup included immune serology and total immunoglobulin (Ig) E measurements, all of which were within normal limits. A differential blood cell count revealed 10% eosinophils (normal, <6%) and an absolute eosinophil count 500/µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Titers for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-Ro (SS-A), and anti-La (SS-B) were negative. Sialendoscopy of her right parotid and left submandibular glands found no obstructing stones or strictures. Concurrent steroid irrigation did not provide any substantial benefit. An open biopsy of the right parotid tail revealed nonspecific inflammatory changes and otherwise normal parenchyma. Given the frequency and severity of her symptoms along with multiple treatment failures, she opted to undergo a right superficial parotidectomy, which proceeded without complications. Further histologic examination of the surgical specimen revealed substantial periductal inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils, as seen in the Figure. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Eosinophilic sialodochitis,"Certainly, let's construct a 10-step differential diagnosis based on the provided case:

1. **IgG4-Related Disease**: Given the nonspecific inflammation and eosinophil infiltration observed in tissue.
2. **Chronic Allergic Reaction**: Persistent eosinophilia and lack of response to antihistamines.
3. **Angioedema**: Recurrent facial swelling, non-responsive to second-generation antihistamines.
4. **Sarcoidosis**: Chronic inflammation potentially exacerbated by the relocation to California.
5. **Sjogren’s Syndrome**: Salivary gland involvement, though the absence of specific antibodies (anti-Ro, anti-La) makes this less likely.
6. **Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA)**: Elevated eosinophils and recurrent inflammation.
7. **Lymphoma**: Chronic immunological disturbances and facial swelling; nonetheless, less likely given the lack of masses or significant findings on biopsy.
8. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: Could fit some immune disturbances; however, antibody profile (negative ANA) does not support this.
9. **Chronic Parotitis**: Persistent inflammation despite normal imaging, suggestive of an underlying chronic inflammatory process.
10. **Infectious Etiology (e.g., Tuberculosis)**: Chronic facial swelling and persistent inflammation despite negative routine tests.

Now, let's proceed to rerank these based on the full picture:

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA)**: Given the elevated eosinophils, chronic inflammatory symptoms and immune characteristics, EGPA stands as a prime hypothesis.
2. **IgG4-Related Disease**: Substantial inflammatory infiltration with eosinophils could fit this systemic condition known for such infiltrates.
3. **Angioedema**: The episodic, severe facial swelling and partial response to steroids suggest this as a possibility.
4. **Chronic Allergic Reaction**: Persistent eosinophilia, though less likely without clear environmental or dietary triggers.
5. **Sarcoidosis**: Chronic inflammation could fit, especially with new local environmental exposure, but less likely given the specific symptoms.
6. **Sjogren’s Syndrome**: Secondary consideration due to the gland involvement, but absence of typical autoantibodies reduces likelihood.
7. **Chronic Parotitis**: The consistent, treatment-resistant gland inflammation makes it a reasonable suspicion.
8. **Lymphoma**: Could account for chronic swelling; however, not supported by biopsy findings.
9. **Infectious Etiology (e.g., Tuberculosis)**: Persistent inflammation despite negative standard tests warrants consideration of more atypical infections.
10. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: Unlikely given negative ANA and specific antibody tests, though still a part of broad autoimmune differential.

### INPUT:
A 78-year-old White man was referred to our clinic for evaluation of an unexplained subjective decrease in vision for more than 6 months, more pronounced in the right eye, and insufficiently controlled intraocular pressure (IOP). Local antiglaucoma therapy with a fixed-combination prostaglandin and β-blocker was used regularly in both eyes owing to long-standing primary open-angle glaucoma. Uneventful cataract surgery with phacoemulsification and in-the-bag insertion of an intraocular lens was performed 10 years earlier in both eyes.  Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 1.0 and 0.5 (Snellen equivalent, 20/20 and 20/40) OD and OS, respectively. His manifest refraction revealed a difference of −0.75 D sphere compared with his own preexisting glasses in the right eye. IOP was 24 mm Hg in the right eye and 18 mm Hg in the left eye. Slitlamp examination revealed a milky substance in the retrolental space, more pronounced in the right eye (Figure) but evident in both. The rest of the slitlamp examination was unremarkable with moderate superficial punctate keratitis owing to ocular surface disease, an anterior chamber depth of Van Herick grade 4 (peripheral anterior chamber depth >1 corneal thickness), an absence of anterior chamber inflammation, and a moderate amount of Elschnig pearls in both eyes. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Late-onset postoperative capsular bag distension syndrome,"Let's proceed systematically through the differential diagnosis for this patient.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Pseudophakic Bullous Keratopathy (PBK)**
   - This condition could be associated with previous cataract surgery and subsequent complications affecting corneal clarity.

2. **Fuchs' Endothelial Dystrophy**
   - While the description doesn't specify endothelial details, this common condition in older adults could account for visual symptoms.

3. **Chronic Angle-Closure Glaucoma**
   - Despite an open-angle primary diagnosis, chronic angle-closure can sometimes present atypically and may be missed initially.

4. **Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome (PXF)**
   - PXF glaucoma can have similar presentations with higher IOP and possible lens deposits.

5. **Pigment Dispersion Syndrome**
   - Given the IOP not well controlled, pigment dispersion leading to secondary glaucoma must be considered.

6. **Cystoid Macular Edema (CME)**
   - Post cataract surgery, CME can cause visual decline despite successful surgery, particularly with longstanding cases.

7. **Diabetic Retinopathy**
   - Even if not explicitly stated, this is common in elderly and can cause substantial vision loss and retrolental findings.

8. **Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO)**
   - It could lead to vision decline and secondary complications in an elderly patient.

9. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**
   - Common in elderly adults and could explain subjective decrease in vision.

10. **Cataract Secondary Opacification (after-cataract)**
   - Although previously not specified, this could evolve over time and cause significant vision issues.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome (PXF)**
   - The milky substance and insufficient IOP control are suggestive, especially post-cataract surgery.

2. **Pigment Dispersion Syndrome**
   - Secondary glaucoma with currently uncontrolled IOP and previous cataract surgery make this plausible.

3. **Cataract Secondary Opacification (after-cataract)**
   - Common in patients post phacoemulsification, causing significant visual symptoms.

4. **Cystoid Macular Edema (CME)**
   - Post cataract surgery with visual decline fits well, especially long-term.

5. **Pseudophakic Bullous Keratopathy (PBK)**
   - Consideration due to past cataract surgery and subjective vision decline.

6. **Chronic Angle-Closure Glaucoma**
   - Can present subtly over a prolonged period with fluctuating IOP.

7. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**
   - Given his age and visual complaints, this ubiquitous issue for the elderly should be considered.

8. **Diabetic Retinopathy**
   - Any assumption about diabetes is tentative but worth ruling out considering its prevalence.

9. **Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO)**
   - Could present later with more overt symptoms but important to rule out.

10. **Fuchs' Endothelial Dystrophy**
   - While less likely due to its typical symptoms, it's worth considering given the age of the patient.

### INPUT:
A 55-year-old US-born man with a history of cataract surgery in both eyes 3 years ago presented with worsening blurriness, photopsia, floaters, and intermittent eye redness for the past year, worse in the left eye. He was otherwise well. The referring physician was treating him with prednisolone eye drops for cystoid macular edema after recent left Nd:YAG capsulotomy. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/30 OS with intraocular pressures of 20 mm Hg OD and 26 mm Hg OS. The anterior segments showed well-positioned posterior chamber intraocular lens implants with open posterior capsules. Dilated fundus examination revealed a small peripheral hypoautofluorescent chorioretinal scar in the right eye. In the left eye, there was trace vitreous haze and 2+ anterior vitreous cell. Multifocal chorioretinal scars extended from the left optic nerve into the macula in each quadrant (Figure 1). These lesions showed variable hypoautofluorescence and hyperautofluorescence. On indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), the confluent hypoautofluorescent lesions showed loss of the choriocapillaris and prominent large choroidal vessels, whereas the mottled hypoautofluorescence and hyperautofluorescent lesions appeared to block the underlying fluorescence. Routine laboratory testing was unremarkable except for a positive interferon-gamma release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A chest radiograph was normal. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Tuberculous serpiginouslike choroiditis,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Ocular Tuberculosis**: Given the positive interferon-gamma release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, ocular TB should be considered.
2. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Disease**: The presence of choroidal lesions and ocular inflammation can be seen in VKH disease.
3. **Presumed Ocular Histoplasmosis Syndrome (POHS)**: Multifocal chorioretinal scars can be characteristic of POHS.
4. **Sarcoidosis**: Chronic eye inflammation and chorioretinal scars can suggest ocular sarcoidosis.
5. **Toxoplasmosis**: The presence of chorioretinal scars and vitreous haze could be due to ocular toxoplasmosis.
6. **Birdshot Chorioretinopathy**: The varied autofluorescence lesions aligning with visual symptoms might indicate birdshot chorioretinopathy.
7. **Sympathetic Ophthalmia**: Post-surgical onset of uveitis and retinal involvement, especially after cataract surgery, can indicate sympathetic ophthalmia.
8. **Syphilitic Uveitis**: Multifocal chorioretinal scars and positive response to treatment can suggest syphilitic uveitis.
9. **Behçet’s Disease**: This condition can present with recurrent eye redness and can cause chorioretinal inflammation.
10. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis**: In immunocompetent individuals, this might present similarly though it's unlikely without immunosuppression.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Ocular Tuberculosis:** Positive interferon-gamma release assay and ocular involvement strongly support this diagnosis, especially with a chorioretinal scar and systemic relevance.
2. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Disease:** Fits the presentation of multifocal chorioretinal scars and ocular inflammation.
3. **Toxoplasmosis:** Common cause of multifocal chorioretinal scars that can explain the chronic eye symptoms and fundus findings.
4. **Presumed Ocular Histoplasmosis Syndrome (POHS):** The chorioretinal scars are typical, though less likely without clear infection history.
5. **Birdshot Chorioretinopathy:** Presents with multifocal chorioretinal lesions but is lower on the differential due to less typical presentation.
6. **Sarcoidosis:** Eye symptoms can align but require systemic involvement; less likely with normal labs.
7. **Syphilitic Uveitis:** Matches the ocular findings but relatively non-specific without corroborative systemic signs.
8. **Sympathetic Ophthalmia:** Less likely as typically bilateral and follows traumatic injury or surgery more acutely.
9. **Behçet’s Disease:** Recurrent inflammation fits, though systemic signs typically present.
10. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis:** Unlikely without immunosuppression but possible in severe cases.

By incorporating all patient details and test results, ocular tuberculosis remains the top suspected diagnosis given the positive interferon-gamma release assay and ocular findings, followed by entities closely mimicking the presentation of multifocal chorioretinal inflammation.","['Infectious Diseases', 'Macular Diseases', 'Ophthalmology', 'Tuberculosis', 'Choroidal Disorders']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,55.0,M

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old woman with a history of metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoid tumor (NET) status in remission after liver transplant was hospitalized for workup of a new pancreatic mass concerning for recurrence. Several days into her hospital course, she developed acute-onset severe bilateral periorbital swelling, chemosis, and ophthalmoplegia as well as occasional flushing and palpitations. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/70 in both eyes. Pupils, intraocular pressure, and color vision were normal. She had bilateral proptosis to 20/21 mm by Hertel exophthalmometer, −3 restriction of extraocular movements in all directions of gaze, diffuse punctate epithelial erosions, and mechanical lower lid entropion secondary to severe chemosis in both eyes (Figure 1A). Anterior segment examination and dilated ophthalmoscopy results were otherwise unremarkable.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Orbital Cellulitis** - Given the acute onset and severity of bilateral periorbital swelling, proptosis, and restricted extraocular movement.
2. **Allergic Reaction** - The symptoms of acute severe swelling and flushing are consistent with an allergic reaction.
3. **Systemic Mastocytosis** - The flushing and palpitations suggest potential systemic involvement that fits with mastocytosis.
4. **Recurrence of Neuroendocrine Tumor (NET)** - Considering her history, recurrence with orbital involvement could explain many of the symptoms.
5. **Orbital Metastasis** - While recurrent NET is considered, metastasis from another primary cancer could also be relevant.
6. **Thyroid Eye Disease (Graves' Ophthalmopathy)** - Exophthalmos and restricted eye movements are consistent, though other systemic signs and thyroid status would need evaluation.
7. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation (Orbital Pseudotumor)** - Comprehensive symptoms including severe chemosis and proptosis are possible in this condition.
8. **Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis** - Severe eye symptoms could be due to this condition, though it often presents with other neurological signs.
9. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome** - This syndrome could explain ophthalmoplegia, though bilateral presentation and other systemic findings need consideration.

### Reasoning:

1. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL)**: Presents with skin lesions, fatigue, night sweats, and weight loss, which are classic systemic symptoms associated with CTCL.
2. **Leukemia Cutis**: Involving systemic symptoms and characteristic skin lesions, it is common in older adults.
3. **Kaposi Sarcoma**: Can present with skin lesions, especially in patients with immunosuppression or HIV, but less likely in this demographic without known immunosuppression.
4. **Subcutaneous Panniculitis-like T-cell Lymphoma**: A type of lymphoma that can present with systemic symptoms and cutaneous lesions.
5. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**: Often involves systemic symptoms with an underlying malignancy, which can present with skin manifestations.
6. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Can present as enlarging skin lesions but is less likely to cause systemic symptoms like night sweats and weight loss.
7. **Disseminated Mycobacterial Infection**: Can cause skin lesions but typically involves a history of immunocompromise or known exposure.
8. **Infective Endocarditis with Osler Nodes/Janeway Lesions**: Unlikely without a history of recent infection or more significant cardiac findings.
9. **Secondary Syphilis**: Presents with a wide variety of skin lesions but usually has a history of potential exposure or primary lesion.
10. **Cryoglobulinemia**: Often involves systemic symptoms and skin lesions but requires a history of cold exposure or related conditions.

### INPUT:
A 51-year-old woman presented with a 24-hour history of severe dizziness that she described as “room spinning,” right aural fullness, and a subjective right-sided hearing loss. She denied any medical history of vertigo, recent upper respiratory infection, head trauma, or prior otologic surgery. A physical examination revealed no abnormalities on otoscopic evaluation; however, a strongly positive right-sided Dix−Hallpike test was elicited with rotary nystagmus; a subsequent Epley maneuver was performed. The patient’s symptoms subjectively worsened during the following several days. Therefore, an audiogram test (Figure 1) and computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone were performed. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pneumolabyrinth,"To proceed with a differential diagnosis, we can start with the most common causes of the described symptoms and then consider other possible diagnoses as more information becomes available. 

1. **Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)**: Given the positive Dix-Hallpike test and rotary nystagmus.

2. **Ménière’s Disease**: Due to the presence of aural fullness, subjective hearing loss, and vertigo.

3. **Vestibular Neuritis**: Often presents with acute onset of vertigo without hearing loss.

4. **Labyrinthitis**: Typically presents with vertigo and hearing loss following an infection.

5. **Acoustic Neuroma**: Typically presents with unilateral hearing loss and possible vertigo.

6. **Perilymph Fistula**: May present with dizziness and hearing loss often associated with a history of barotrauma or heavy lifting.

7. **Multiple Sclerosis**: Can present with vertigo and hearing loss in some cases.

8. **Otosclerosis**: Can present with conductive hearing loss and dizziness but less commonly with vertigo.

9. **Migraine-associated Vertigo (Vestibular Migraine)**: Can present with vertigo, hearing symptoms, and no significant findings on imaging.

10. **Stroke (specifically in the posterior circulation)**: Sudden onset vertigo with or without hearing loss, often needing imaging to rule out.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results
After considering the additional tests such as the audiogram and temporal bone CT:

1. **Ménière’s Disease**: Given the combination of aural fullness, subjective hearing loss, and vertigo, this diagnosis aligns well, especially if audiogram shows low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss typical of Ménière’s disease.
   
2. **Acoustic Neuroma**: Unilateral hearing loss and progressive symptoms; an audiogram showing asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss would heighten this suspicion.

3. **Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)**: Strongly suggested by the positive Dix-Hallpike test, though the worsening of symptoms post-Epley maneuver could suggest another diagnosis.

4. **Labyrinthitis**: If there are indications of recent or concurrent viral infection and comprehensive hearing loss, this could be suspected.

5. **Vestibular Neuritis**: With significant vertigo but no hearing loss, this would be less likely due to the reported hearing loss.

6. **Perilymph Fistula**: This might be considered, especially with a history suggesting trauma or significant pressure changes.

7. **Migraine-associated Vertigo (Vestibular Migraine)**: Lesser likelihood if no history of migraines is reported and audiogram results do not align.

8. **Multiple Sclerosis**: Considered if other neurological symptoms are present; requires further testing such as MRI.

9. **Otosclerosis**: Considered if conductive rather than sensorineural hearing loss is noted.

10. **Stroke**: Lower on the list but still a consideration if acute onset and especially if any other neurological deficits are present.

Detailed findings from the audiogram and CT scan would significantly narrow down these differential diagnoses.

### INPUT:
A 6-year-old boy with severe autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was brought to the hospital by his mother for whitening in the right eye. The patient was nonverbal at baseline and exhibited restrictive and repetitive behaviors. His diet consisted exclusively of cookies, apples, potato chips, and Gatorade. His mother noticed him frequently rubbing his eyes for several weeks, which she initially attributed to new-onset allergies. She did not describe any reduction in visual function or ability to perform low-luminance tasks. The patient was admitted and ophthalmology was consulted. He required an examination under sedation. His visual acuity could not be determined. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect in either eye. The eyelids were mildly erythematous with bilateral eyelash hypertrichosis. The conjunctiva and cornea appeared dry and leathery bilaterally. The right cornea was diffusely hazy with a 3-mm paracentral epithelial defect with 60% stromal thinning and a 1-mm infiltrate. There was a small crescentic fibrin deposit nasally in the right anterior chamber. The left cornea was diffusely hazy with a 1-mm epithelial defect without stromal thinning (Figure). Dilated examination showed bilateral grade 3 optic nerve head edema and otherwise normal retinal findings. Fortified vancomycin eye drops, 25 mg/mL, and tobramycin eye drops, 15 mg/mL, were initiated. Results of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were normal. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Xerophthalmia and keratomalacia from vitamin A deficiency,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis using the Provided Case Information

1. **Vitamin A Deficiency:** Given the patient's restrictive diet, limited in variety and likely lacking essential nutrients, Vitamin A deficiency is a prime candidate. This deficiency can lead to xerophthalmia, which is consistent with the dry, leathery conjunctiva and the corneal ulceration observed.

2. **Keratitis:** The hazy cornea with stromal thinning and infiltrate could indicate a form of keratitis (inflammation of the cornea), possibly due to infection or other underlying condition.

3. **Allergic Conjunctivitis:** The mother's initial suspicion of allergies due to frequent eye rubbing and mildly erythematous eyelids points to allergic conjunctivitis.

4. **Keratoconjunctivitis:** The combination of dry, leathery conjunctiva and corneal epithelial defects are consistent with forms of keratoconjunctivitis, such as Sjögren’s syndrome, though it is rare in children and typically would present with more systemic symptoms.

5. **Trichiasis:** The eyelash hypertrichosis could result in misdirected eyelashes (trichiasis) causing corneal abrasion and subsequent infections or irritations.

6. **Neurotrophic Keratopathy:** This would explain the absence of pain despite significant corneal pathology, as well as the epitheliopathy and stromal thinning.

7. **Infectious Keratitis:** Given the response to antimicrobial therapy, an infectious etiology, possibly bacterial, viral, or fungal keratitis, must be considered.

8. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS):** This severe mucocutaneous reaction could present with dry, leathery conjunctiva and corneal defects, although it usually presents with more systemic involvement and acute history.

9. **Cataract:** Though not fully consistent with all findings, the whiteness in the eye could consider a cataract, especially given the patient’s non-verbal status impeding clear communication about vision changes.

10. **Toxin or Chemical Exposure:** Ongoing eye rubbing could be tied to chronic irritation from an environmental toxin or chemical, potentially leading to chronic damage and infection.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis after Considering all Patient Information and Test Results

Based on the detailed patient history, clinical examination, and test results, here is the reranked list:
1. **Vitamin A Deficiency**
2. **Infectious Keratitis**
3. **Neurotrophic Keratopathy**
4. **Keratitis**
5. **Keratoconjunctivitis**
6. **Allergic Conjunctivitis**
7. **Trichiasis**
8. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)**
9. **Toxin or Chemical Exposure**
10. **Cataract**

These rankings give priority to conditions that explain the ocular and dietary history, the clinical severity of corneal findings, and are consistent with the examination findings. Vitamin A deficiency is particularly prioritized due to the specific dietary restrictions that could easily lead to such deficits, while infectious keratitis is emphasized because of the positive response to fortified antibiotics.","['Cornea', 'Nutrition', 'Ophthalmology', 'Psychiatry and Behavioral Health', 'Child and Adolescent Psychiatry']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6.0,M

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Morphea (localized scleroderma):** Considered due to the atrophic skin surrounded by an erythematous border.
2. **Granuloma Annulare:** Consider the annular configuration and erythematous border.
3. **Lupus Erythematosus (Discoid Lupus):** Due to erythema and atrophic changes.
4. **Lichen Sclerosus et Atrophicus:** Consider the atrophic appearance and chronic nature.
5. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica:** Due to annular rings with central atrophy.
6. **Chronic Cutaneous Sarcoidosis:** Due to chronicity and erythematous lesions.
7. **Dermatomyositis:** Skin involvement with erythema and atrophy.
8. **Erythema Annulare Centrifugum:** Erythematous, annular lesions with central clearing.
9. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides):** Consider due to chronic skin changes.
10. **Linear IgA Bullous Dermatosis:** Due to chronic erythematous lesions.

### Reranking of Differential Diagnoses:
Now, we'd rerank the diagnoses based on the comprehensive patient information available, focusing on the specific features: asymptomatic nature, lesion distribution, erythematous border, and atrophy.

1. **Morphea (localized scleroderma):** The most likely due to the clinical presentation with atrophic skin and erythematous border.
2. **Granuloma Annulare:** Likely due to the centrifugal progression and annular shape.
3. **Lupus Erythematosus (Discoid Lupus):** Possible due to erythema and atrophic centration pattern.
4. **Lichen Sclerosus et Atrophicus:** For the atrophic appearance and distribution pattern.
5. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica:** Based on the ring-shaped lesion with central atrophy.
6. **Chronic Cutaneous Sarcoidosis:** Possible due to chronic skin changes and erythema.
7. **Erythema Annulare Centrifugum:** Fits the centrifugal progression and erythematous nature.
8. **Dermatomyositis:** Less likely but considered for the atrophic and erythematous skin changes.
9. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides):** Less likely but possible due to chronic skin plaques.
10. **Linear IgA Bullous Dermatosis:** The least likely because it typically presents with blisters.

### INPUT:
A healthy 27-year-old woman received a COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccine (Moderna) on December 7, 2021. She had not experienced adverse effects after the first 2 vaccine doses on January 17 and February 5, 2021. Twelve days after the booster vaccination, she developed pruritic wheals on her face and bilateral, transient eyelid swelling. Over the next week, a pruritic rash spread over her neck, chest, trunk, and arms; each lesion faded without scarring within 24 hours. She did not experience lip, tongue, or neck swelling; shortness of breath; wheezing; chest pain; or palpitations. Application of pressure to her forearm in a circular motion using a pen cap elicited wheal and flare lesions (Figure, left panel). On physical examination, performed 17 days after the onset of rash, her vital signs were normal. She had no tongue, lip, or throat swelling, and her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Wheal and flare lesions developed on her upper eyelids during the examination and resolved after approximately 30 minutes (Figure, right panel). Light pressure applied to her skin with a tongue depressor elicited wheal and flare lesions within 3 to 5 minutes.

**Reranking differential diagnoses based on the patient information and test results:**

1. Urticaria (Most consistent with the immediate wheal and flare reaction seen with application of pressure and the transient nature of the rash)
2. Drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction (Potential delayed hypersensitivity could be mediated by the booster vaccination)
3. Mastocytosis (Though less likely, systemic involvement of mast cells can cause recurrent wheals)
4. Angioedema (Transient eyelid swelling, although she didn't have more severe systemic symptoms)
5. Urticarial vasculitis (Pruritic rash, although typically this condition involves longer-lasting lesions and potential systemic symptoms)
6. Contact dermatitis (Physical examination could exclude other potential contact allergens)
7. Erythema multiforme (Although usually associated with target lesions or an infectious antecedent)
8. Viral exanthem (Often post-viral rashes can present with pruritic wheals, albeit less likely given no associated systemic symptoms)
9. Systemic lupus erythematosus (Chronic autoimmune condition could present with rash, more unlikely without other systemic symptoms)
10. Atopic dermatitis (Chronic nature and distribution of the rash can match, though less likely without a prior history)

### INPUT:
A middle-aged patient with a remote history of bilateral juvenile cataracts after posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) placement presented with decreased vision in the right eye for several months. There was no recent ocular trauma or intraocular surgery. At the time of the initial examination, visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye, with a refraction of −1.50 diopters (D) sphere in both eyes. Examination was notable for a superonasal area of pigmentation with elevation of the conjunctiva and an inferotemporally subluxed PCIOL in the right eye. Results of the fundus examination were reported to be normal in both eyes and the anterior examination of the left eye was notable for only a well-positioned PCIOL. The patient was referred to a cornea specialist for further evaluation and treatment. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, specialty evaluation occurred 10 weeks later at which time the patient complained of progressive vision loss in the right eye. Visual acuity measured hand motion in the right eye with normal intraocular pressure. The PCIOL was subluxed inferotemporally with vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber (Figure 1A). A 4 mm × 3.1-mm superonasal pigmented scleral lesion was also noted (Figure 1B). The examination of the left eye was remarkable only for a well-centered PCIOL and iris transillumination defects. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Intraocular lens implant subluxation and extrascleral extension secondary to ciliochoroidal melanoma,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Lens Subluxation**: Given the inferotemporally subluxed PCIOL, the primary differential to consider is lens subluxation.
2. **Vitreous Prolapse**: Vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber is another immediate conclusion based on the clinical signs.
3. **Pigmented Scleral Lesion**: The superonasal pigmented scleral lesion introduces a differential for an ocular tumor such as a conjunctival melanoma.
4. **Progressive Vision Loss**: The hand motion visual acuity and progressive vision loss could be compatible with retinal detachment that was not evident on initial examination.
5. **Post-Surgical Complications**: Since the patient had PCIOL in position for years, one should consider chronic inflammatory conditions like uveitis.
6. **High Myopia**: The high myopia noted (−1.50 D) may suggest a predisposition to macular problems such as myopic maculopathy.
7. **Pigmentary Glaucoma**: Given the iris transillumination defects, pigment dispersion syndrome could be a consideration which may lead to pigmentary glaucoma.
8. **Intraocular Tumor Metastasis**: Metastasis from another primary site should be considered in the differential diagnosis for the pigmented lesion.
9. **Corneal Pathologies**: Corneal decompensation or edema secondary to previous surgeries.
10. **Retinal Vascular Occlusion**: The stepwise progression could also point toward retinal vein or artery occlusion.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Lens Subluxation**: Given the history and presentation, the inferotemporally subluxed PCIOL remains the most immediate concern.
2. **Vitreous Prolapse**: This directly supports the clinical presentation of the anterior chamber's vitreous prolapse.
3. **Pigmented Scleral Lesion**: Conjunctival melanoma or another ocular tumor is critical due to the pigmentation and elevation.
4. **Retinal Detachment**: With the progressive vision loss and no other apparent cause initially, this becomes a significant contender.
5. **Pigmentary Glaucoma**: Iris transillumination defects support this as an essential differential diagnosis.
6. **Post-Surgical Uveitis**: Chronic inflammation post-surgery is a logical consideration.
7. **High Myopia Complications**: The minimal myopia might have been underplayed but is essential for focal vision assessment.
8. **Intraocular Tumor Metastasis**: Given there's a pigmented lesion, a metastatic process cannot be ruled out.
9. **Corneal Decompensation**: Post-surgical changes might lead to progressive vision deterioration.
10. **Retinal Vascular Occlusion**: The vision loss trajectory is concerning for vascular issues that need further exploration.

### INPUT:
A 66-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and chronic hepatitis B treated with tenofovir presented to the emergency department for evaluation of digital erythema and painful finger ulcers, which developed 6 months prior but which had increased in number and become more painful in the past several weeks. She also reported dyspnea on exertion, which developed 6 months prior to presentation. On physical examination, her peripheral oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. Auscultation of her lungs revealed crackles at the bases bilaterally. She had normal strength throughout all muscle groups and full range of motion in the joints of her hands. The palmar surfaces of her hands revealed livedo racemosa, erythema, and retiform purpura; ulcers overlying her phalangeal joint creases and fingertips; and scale and fissures on several digits (Figure). On the dorsal surfaces there was a large ulcer on the right second metacarpophalangeal joint and erythematous papules over several metacarpophalangeal joints. Ulcers were also noted on her elbows. Laboratory testing showed a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL and normal creatine kinase level. The patient was admitted to the hospital for pain management and expedited workup of her progressive finger ulcerations. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Anti–melanoma differentiation–associated protein 5 (MDA5) antibody-positive dermatomyositis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma)**: Given the presentation of digital ulcers, livedo racemosa, and dyspnea, systemic sclerosis is a primary consideration.
2. **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)**: Finger ulcers and erythematous papules can be seen in severe cases of RA with secondary vasculitis.
3. **Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: The combination of skin findings with systemic symptoms (dyspnea) requires consideration of lupus.
4. **Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD)**: Presents with overlapping features of SLE, systemic sclerosis, and RA.
5. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis)**: Necrotizing vasculitis that could explain ulcerations and dyspnea.
6. **Cryoglobulinemia**: Chronic hepatitis B infection can lead to cryoglobulins causing vasculitis with ulcers and purpura.
7. **Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)**: Could present with ulcers due to impaired blood flow, especially in a diabetic patient.
8. **Diabetic Dermopathy**: Secondary to chronic diabetes, although less likely given the severity of skin findings.
9. **Chronic Hepatitis B-associated Vasculitis**: Vasculitis associated specifically with hepatitis B infection.
10. **Paraneoplastic Syndromes**: Some cancers can cause paraneoplastic syndromes with skin manifestations and systemic symptoms.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses Considering All Information:
1. **Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma)**: Leading consideration due to the specific digital findings (ulcers, erythema) and dyspnea suggesting potential interstitial lung disease.
2. **Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: Significant contender with the presence of purpura, ulcers, and systemic involvement.
3. **Cryoglobulinemia**: Chronic hepatitis B increases the risk of cryoglobulinemia causing vasculitis and ulcers.
4. **Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)**: Important to consider in a diabetic with ulcers, although physical examination may suggest more systemic involvement.
5. **Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD)**: Given overlapping symptoms of various autoimmune conditions.
6. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis)**: Dyspnea and necrotizing vasculitis could explain findings.
7. **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)**: Erythematous papules and ulcers could be due to severe RA vasculitis.
8. **Chronic Hepatitis B-associated Vasculitis**: Considering her hepatitis B status, although secondary to cryoglobulinemia.
9. **Diabetic Dermopathy**: Reduced likelihood due to more severe and systemic ulcerations but still a differential due to her diabetic status.
10. **Paraneoplastic Syndromes**: While less likely in absence of identified malignancy, should be considered if the diagnosis remains elusive.

The patient’s presentation suggests an autoimmune or vascular etiology due to the nature of the ulcers, systemic involvement, and prior medical history. Systemic sclerosis tops the differential due to the classical cutaneous findings and associated pulmonary symptoms. Further rheumatologic investigations and imaging are required for a definite diagnosis.","['Pulmonary Medicine', 'Rheumatology', 'Connective Tissue Disease of the Skin', 'Dermatology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,66.0,F

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old man presented with a history of previous left superficial parotidectomy 10 years before for a Warthin tumor. His histology results showed a 5-cm Warthin tumor, with a focus of nodular oncocytic hyperplasia in the adjacent parenchyma and reactive intraparotid lymph nodes. He presented to the ear, nose, and throat clinic and complained of pain in the operative site of 6 months duration. This occurred intermittently once a week and lasted for a few minutes each time. It was associated with a small lump over the left neck, and the pain was worse on touch and head turning. On examination, there was a 3-mm nodularity palpated deep to the neck wound along the mid sternocleidomastoid muscle. It was associated with focal tenderness. His facial nerve function was otherwise normal, and sensation in the ear lobe was intact. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was performed, and the results showed no focal lesion in either parotid glands or at the area of interest over the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. The patient was counseled for an excisional biopsy of the left neck nodule. The intraoperative photograph of the neck and the excised specimen is shown in Figure 1. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Greater auricular nerve neuroma,"Let's proceed step by step to create a differential diagnosis list for the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

**Step 1:** **Recurrence of Warthin Tumor**
- History of Warthin tumor and previous surgery in the area.

**Step 2:** **Oncocytic Carcinoma**
- Given the nodular nature and previous histology showing oncocytic hyperplasia.

**Step 3:** **Nerve Entrapment Syndrome**
- Pain exacerbated by touch and head movement could suggest nerve involvement.

**Step 4:** **Scar Tissue/Neuroma**
- Post-surgical changes and pain at the operative site.

**Step 5:** **Lymphoma**
- Small lump in the neck and intraparotid lymph node involvement noted previously.

**Step 6:** **Infection/Abscess**
- Intermittent pain and tenderness suggestive of possible low-grade infection or abscess formation.

**Step 7:** **Metastatic Disease**
- New nodule in a patient with a history of a parotid tumor. Need to rule out metastatic spread from any primary neoplasm.

**Step 8:** **Chronic Sialadenitis**
- Chronic inflammation possibly due to previous surgery, leading to the formation of a small nodule.

**Step 9:** **Sialolithiasis**
- A stone in the salivary duct could present as a small, painful nodule.

**Step 10:** **Benign Lymphoepithelial Lesion**
- Benign lesion that can mimic malignancies and is prevalent in the parotid region.

---

### Reranking Using All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Scar Tissue/Neuroma** - Post-surgical changes with focal tenderness and no significant findings on MRI make this a likely possibility.
2. **Nerve Entrapment Syndrome** - Pain related to touch and head movement is consistent with nerve involvement.
3. **Recurrence of Warthin Tumor** - Given the history and focal nodularity, but less likely without focal lesion on MRI.
4. **Oncocytic Carcinoma** - Previous history of oncocytic hyperplasia and ongoing symptoms could suggest malignancy, though rare.
5. **Metastatic Disease** - Consider for any new lump in a patient with a history of a tumor, but MRI shows no lesion.
6. **Lymphoma** - New nodule in the neck with previous lymph node involvement, though MRI findings make this less likely.
7. **Chronic Sialadenitis** - Chronic inflammatory process could explain the small nodule and pain.
8. **Infection/Abscess** - Less likely without suggestive imaging findings, but still a possibility.
9. **Sialolithiasis** - Unlikely without suggestive imaging findings and absence of typical stone symptoms.
10. **Benign Lymphoepithelial Lesion** - Least likely given the patient’s history and imaging results.","['Otolaryngology', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Pain Medicine', 'Neurology', 'Neuromuscular Diseases']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,63.0,M

### INPUT:
A woman in her 60s with a history of hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and chronic migraines presented with 9 months of progressively worsening left-sided ptosis, which was more notable at night and with fatigue. She denied experiencing pain, diplopia, muscle weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, difficulty breathing, or other neurologic deficits. On examination, corrected visual acuity was 20/20 bilaterally, with normal color vision, visual fields, intraocular pressure, extraocular movements, alignment, and pupils. External examination was notable for left upper eyelid ptosis (Figure 1), with a margin-to-reflex distance 1 of 3.5 mm on the right and 0.5 mm on the left, intact levator function, and no fatiguability on sustained upgaze. There was no evidence of eyelid edema, erythema, or tenderness to palpation. There were no palpable adnexal masses or orbital rim deformities, but there was mild fullness in the left superior sulcus and mildly increased left-sided resistance to retropulsion. However, Hertel exophthalmometry did not reveal any relative proptosis. No lacrimal gland abnormalities or conjunctival masses were seen with upper eyelid eversion. There was no palpable preauricular or cervical lymphadenopathy. Slitlamp and fundus examination findings were normal. Serological testing results for antiacetylcholine receptor antibody were negative. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Unilateral ptosis secondary to mantle cell lymphoma of the left lacrimal gland,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Myasthenia Gravis (MG)**: Initially considered due to ptosis and exacerbation with fatigue, but serological testing for antiacetylcholine receptor antibody negates this diagnosis.
   
2. **Horner's Syndrome**: Given ptosis and potential mild enophthalmos, but the absence of miosis and anhidrosis reduces likelihood.
   
3. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)**: Ptosis with normal eye movements, though CPEO usually involves other eye movement limitations.
   
4. **Levator Palpebrae Superioris Dysfunction (LPS Dysfunction)**: Ptosis without fatigue or other symptoms, but typically secondary to other conditions.
   
5. **Orbital Myositis**: Might explain resistance to retropulsion, but lack of pain or redness makes it less likely.
   
6. **Orbital Tumor (e.g., Lymphoma)**: Mild fullness in the superior sulcus and resistance to retropulsion supports the possibility.
   
7. **Structural Eyelid Abnormality (Dermatochalasis)**: Common in older adults, causing ptosis, but would be bilateral and symmetrical eyelid skin redundancy.
   
8. **Blepharoptosis**: General term for ptosis, which includes neurogenic, myogenic, aponeurotic, or mechanical causes.
   
9. **Neurofibromatosis (NF1)**: Can cause unilateral ptosis in older age, but lacks characteristic café-au-lait spots, Lisch nodules or neurofibromas.
   
10. **Graves' Ophthalmopathy**: Fullness and resistance to retropulsion could suggest this, but no proptosis or other typical signs.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Orbital Tumor (e.g., Lymphoma)**: Most supported by mild fullness and increased resistance to retropulsion. Requires imaging to confirm.
2. **Horner's Syndrome**: Needs pharmacologic testing despite missing some clinical features, still a possible diagnosis.
3. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)**: Ptosis fits, but usually has progressive ophthalmoplegia.
4. **Orbital Myositis**: Despite lack of pain, inflammation could cause resistance to retropulsion.
5. **Blepharoptosis**: Includes varied causes of ptosis; needs further classification.
6. **Graves' Ophthalmopathy**: Typical signs absent, but should still be considered.
7. **Myasthenia Gravis**: Less likely due to negative antibody test, but rare seronegative MG.
8. **Neurofibromatosis (NF1)**: Less likely without other systemic signs.
9. **Levator Palpebrae Superioris Dysfunction (LPS Dysfunction)**: Needs further evaluation to confirm.
10. **Structural Eyelid Abnormality (Dermatochalasis)**: Unlikely due to unilateral ptosis and age-related expected appearance.

Further diagnostic imaging such as MRI or CT scan of the orbit is warranted to better elucidate the underlying cause, particularly to rule out an orbital tumor.","['External Eye Disease', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Lymphomas']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,60.0,F

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy man in his 20s presented to the dermatology department with thickening and swelling of hands after immersion in water, accompanied by burning pruritus for 3 years. The lesions occurred as symmetrical white and transparent papules, white keratosis, excessive wrinkling on the dorsum of hands after water immersion and worsened in summer, and remitted in winter. He was treated with topical tretinoin ointment intermittently per a diagnosis of chronic eczema at the local clinic with little improvement. The lesions gradually aggravated, and the affected area dispersed to wrists and elbows during past the 1.5 years. He attributed these changes to the need for washing hands frequently in the period of the COVID-19 epidemic. He had no family history of similar skin problems and did not have a history of hyperhidrosis, cystic fibrosis, atopy, or trauma to the hands. Physical examination showed some changes emerged on both hands after water immersion contrasting with any other condition (Figure, A and B). We took a skin biopsy specimen from white papules on the right hand, and representative histopathologic features are shown in the Figure, C and D. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma,"Given the provided clinical history and physical examination findings, we'll proceed with a systematic differential diagnosis approach. Here’s a 10-step differential diagnosis considering the presented information and evidence:

1. **Aquagenic Palmoplantar Keratoderma (APK)**
2. **Dyshidrotic Eczema**
3. **Contact Dermatitis**
4. **Psoriasis**
5. **Palmoplantar Keratodermas (other types)**
6. **Pitted Keratolysis**
7. **Lichen Simplex Chronicus**
8. **Tinea Manuum**
9. **Keratosis Pilaris**
10. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (Cutaneous)**

To rerank these differentials considering all the provided patient information and test results (history of lesions that worsen in summer, improve in winter, symmetry, presence of keratosis, exacerbation with water exposure, and negative family history), the revised ranking would be:

1. **Aquagenic Palmoplantar Keratoderma (APK)** - This fits the description most closely, especially given the exacerbation with water exposure and the specific morphology of the lesions.
2. **Palmoplantar Keratodermas (other types)** - Could have similar presentation but less strongly associated with water exposure.
3. **Dyshidrotic Eczema** - Could present similarly but often involves pruritic vesicles that don't fit as well with the described symptoms.
4. **Contact Dermatitis** - He washes his hands often, but chronic symptoms and specific presentation less likely.
5. **Pitted Keratolysis** - Features of bacterial involvement, creating pitting rather than the described thickening and wrinkling.
6. **Psoriasis** - Could present with thickened skin but usually doesn't primarily worsen with water exposure and has a different lesion morphology.
7. **Tinea Manuum** - Fungal infection presenting with scaling and pruritus but usually with other signs of a fungal infection.
8. **Lichen Simplex Chronicus** - Result of chronic scratching, unlikely without significant pruritus and primary lichenification.
9. **Keratosis Pilaris** - Common but presents with small follicular keratotic papules usually on upper arms and thighs, not hands.
10. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (Cutaneous)** - Presents with a wide array of skin manifestations, but less specific to water exposure and the morphology described.",['Dermatology'],1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,20.0,M

### INPUT:
On the day of giving birth via a normal vaginal delivery, a healthy woman in her 20s developed painful swelling on her right thigh, at the site of a methergine injection administered 1 day prior. Despite 3 days of treatment with an oral antibiotic (cefalexin), her thigh pain and swelling did not improve, and she was readmitted to the hospital and intravenous clindamycin was started. Wound cultures and blood cultures obtained during incision and drainage performed on hospital day 1 were negative for bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal organisms. The following day, her temperature was 39.4 °C (102.9 °F), blood pressure was 86/42 mm Hg, and heart rate was 131/min. She was transferred to the intensive care unit for presumed septic shock, and her antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and meropenem. Surgical debridement of the right thigh was performed on hospital day 3. On hospital day 4, a new purple dusky border developed along the wound edge, and the patent underwent a second surgical debridement. After debridement on hospital day 5, her temperature was 39.8 °C (103.6 °F), and she required vasopressor infusion with norepinephrine for shock. Her right thigh had a deep 9 × 8–cm ulcer with a dusky violaceous border extending 2 to 5 cm from the wound edge (Figure, left), with many 1- to 2-mm pustules (not visible in Figure). Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 30 000/μL (88% neutrophils); lactate level, 77.5 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L); and procalcitonin level, 16.1 ng/mL (reference, <0.1 ng/mL). Histologic examination of the tissue obtained during the second surgical debridement revealed ulceration with extensive neutrophilic inflammation (Figure, right). Stains for microorganisms, and tissue and blood cultures, remained negative. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Necrotizing pyoderma gangrenosum,"Let's proceed with the differential diagnosis using the clinical information provided:

1. **Necrotizing Fasciitis** - Consider the possibility of this rapidly progressing bacterial infection that causes necrosis of the muscle fascia and subcutaneous tissues, especially given the severe systemic symptoms, lack of response to antibiotics, and the dusky violaceous border.

2. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum** - This is an inflammatory condition characterized by painful ulcers with a purplish border and is often associated with a systemic inflammatory response.

3. **Gas Gangrene (Clostridial Myonecrosis)** - Despite negative cultures, the clinical presentation and rapid deterioration could suggest this severe infection caused by Clostridium species.

4. **Thrombophlebitis** - Infection or inflammation of a vein that causes pain and swelling in the affected limb.

5. **Ecthyma Gangrenosum** - A rare cutaneous infection, typically caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, leading to necrotic ulcers.

6. **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) with Compartment Syndrome** - This combines the risk of thrombosis with subsequent pressure build-up in the thigh compartments leading to ischemic tissue damage.

7. **Autoimmune Vasculitis** - Inflammatory destruction of blood vessels that can lead to significant tissue damage and ulceration.

8. **Drug Reaction/Injection Reaction** - An adverse reaction to the methergine injection or cephalexin, leading to severe local inflammation and systemic symptoms.

9. **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)** - AML could present with such skin lesions (leukemia cutis) and severe systemic symptoms, especially given the high white blood cell count.

10. **Cutaneous Anthrax** - Although rare, this infection can present with a characteristic black eschar and severe systemic symptoms.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
Given all patient information and test results, we now reevaluate and prioritize the most likely diagnoses:

1. **Necrotizing Fasciitis** - The rapidly progressive nature and severe systemic involvement make this the top consideration despite negative cultures.
2. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum** - Given the ulceration with a dusky violaceous border and extensive neutrophilic inflammation, and the systemic inflammatory response.
3. **Gas Gangrene (Clostridial Myonecrosis)** - The rapid deterioration and necrotic nature of the lesion must keep this high on the list despite negative cultures.
4. **Ecthyma Gangrenosum** - Needs to be considered given the clinical appearance and potential for severe systemic symptoms.
5. **Drug Reaction/Injection Reaction** - A possible severe local reaction to methergine or cephalexin.
6. **Autoimmune Vasculitis** - Could present with severe systemic symptoms and similar appearance on the skin.
7. **Thrombophlebitis** - Not as common and usually not associated with such severe systemic symptoms.
8. **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)** - High WBC could be suggestive but less likely without previous indications of hematological abnormalities.
9. **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) with Compartment Syndrome** - Ulceration and appearance more suggestive of other causes.
10. **Cutaneous Anthrax** - Least likely, given rarity and lack of exposure history typically associated with anthrax.","['Dermatology', 'Surgery', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,20.0,F

    ",Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) with rapidly progressive pauci-immune glomerulonephritis (RPGN),"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Rheumatoid Arthritis**
   - Chronic pain in the small joints (hands, wrists, feet) without redness, warmth, or swelling, but with nasal deformity, may suggest rheumatoid arthritis despite normal x-rays.

2. **Erosive Osteoarthritis**
   - Persistent hand and wrist pain with degenerative changes on radiographs but no bone erosions.

3. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus**
   - Multiple joint pain along with unremarkable physical examination; potential systemic involvement.

4. **Psoriatic Arthritis**
   - Polyarthritis involving hands and feet, possible without visible skin manifestations.

5. **Wegener’s Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**
   - Nasal deformity and joint pain, though no other systemic symptoms present.

6. **Relapsing Polychondritis**
   - Nasal bridge deformity and joint pain; usually with systemic inflammation and episodic chondritis.

7. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Joint pain and nasal deformity but lack of typical systemic signs.

8. **Gout**
   - Chronic joint pain, typically more sudden onset and with acute flares, but may be considered due to foot involvement.

9. **Lyme Disease**
   - Arthritis-like symptoms, though typically accompanied by erythema migrans or other systemic involvement.

10. **Sjögren’s Syndrome**
    - Chronic arthritis-like symptoms, though typically with dry eyes and mouth which are not present in this case.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

Based on the comprehensive patient information and test results provided:

1. **Rheumatoid Arthritis**
   - While no redness, warmth, or swelling is evident, the chronic nature, involvement of small joints, and nasal deformity may fit early or atypical presentations.

2. **Relapsing Polychondritis**
   - The nasal deformity and joint pain are significant indicators. This could fit especially if episodic nature not entirely ruled out.
  
3. **Erosive Osteoarthritis**
   - Degenerative changes in radiographs and a history of osteoarthritis, though no new distinct joint features like erythema or swelling noted.

4. **Wegener’s Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**
   - Nasal deformity cues, and multi-joint involvement suggest further evaluation might be warranted.

5. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus**
   - Even with unremarkable examination, multi-system disease can present subtly; requires further serological assessment.

6. **Psoriatic Arthritis**
   - Fits polyarthritis, though absence of psoriatic plaques or typical sausage digits lowers priority.

7. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Multi-system disease possibility, especially with nasal involvement, though less likely without other systemic signs or findings.

8. **Gout**
   - Recurrent pain usually more acute, but can present chronically; relevant considering foot involvement.

9. **Lyme Disease**
   - Unlikely without systemic symptoms or history of tick exposure despite arthritis-like presentation.

10. **Sjögren’s Syndrome**
    - Lower likelihood due to absence of sicca symptoms, although joint pain is consistent.

The final diagnosis would warrant careful review of serological tests, MRI if needed, and possibly a rheumatology consultation for pinpoint assessment given the complex presentation.","['Nephrology', 'Rheumatology', 'Pulmonary Medicine']",0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,63.0,F

### INPUT:
A 65-year-old woman was referred with a 6-week history of blurry vision, ocular pain, and subconjunctival yellow discoloration in the left eye. Suspicious retinal detachment and intraocular mass were identified, which raised concerns for choroidal melanoma. No symptoms or signs were reported in the right eye. Her ocular history included bilateral cataract surgery 5 years prior. Review of systems yielded negative results, including for ocular trauma, jaundice, and cutaneous melanoma. She had no history of tobacco use. On examination of the left eye, visual acuity was hand motion, and intraocular pressure was 8 mm Hg. The anterior segment showed diffuse conjunctival chemosis of yellow hue, low-grade aqueous reaction, and pseudophakia (Figure 1A). On the fundus evaluation, large pockets of subretinal fluid suggested choroidal effusion based on marked fluid shifting with head position. B-scan ultrasonography confirmed 4-quadrant choroidal hemorrhage and partially mobile serous retinal detachment. B-scans also exhibited a solid lesion from the 6- to 10-o’clock meridians with irregular shape and variable internal reflectivity, measuring 5.8 mm in height. Magnetic resonance imaging was requested to delineate the mass from the surrounding clot (Figure 1B). In the interim, she received oral steroids aiming to contain the abundant exudation and topical atropine for pain, evolving with minimal clinical improvement on these features. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Choroidal metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps

1. **Choroidal Melanoma**: Due to the presence of an intraocular mass identified on B-scan ultrasonography and MRI, and because it is a leading cause of uveal malignant tumors.
   
2. **Choroidal Hemangioma**: This benign vascular tumor can present as an intraocular mass and is a differential to consider alongside melanoma.

3. **Metastatic Carcinoma to the Choroid**: Common in elderly patients, especially with an intraocular mass and past cancer history.
   
4. **Primary Intraocular Lymphoma**: Rare but possible, given intraocular mass, retinal detachment, and symptoms like blurry vision and ocular pain.

5. **Hemorrhagic Choroidal Detachment**: B-scan showing choroidal hemorrhage can be due to spontaneous hemorrhagic detachment.

6. **Posterior Scleritis**: Presents similarly with ocular pain, exudative retinal detachment, and a solid lesion on imaging.

7. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome**: Given the patient's marked subretinal fluid shifting with head position, low intraocular pressure, and yellow conjunctival chemosis.

8. **Amelanotic Nevus**: This can appear as a solid, poorly defined intraocular mass but is usually benign and asymptomatic till it enlarges.
   
9. **Choroidal Granuloma**: Tuberculosis or sarcoidosis can present this way, with choroidal involvement visible on imaging.
   
10. **Choroidal Osteoma**: This rare benign ossifying tumor could mimic the imaging findings, although the patient's presentation is less typical.

1. **Choroidal Melanoma**: Strongest suspicion due to the solid lesion on imaging, unique pattern of internal reflectivity, and higher likelihood in this demographic.
  
2. **Hemorrhagic Choroidal Detachment**: Supported by B-scan ultrasonography confirming choroidal hemorrhage and serous retinal detachment.

3. **Posterior Scleritis**: Solid lesion and clinical presentation including pain strongly suggest inflammatory etiology which can be controlled by steroids.

4. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome**: Considered for the significant exudation and matching clinical presentation, marked fluid shift with head position.
   
5. **Choroidal Hemangioma**: Could explain the intraocular mass and associated vascular changes but typically does not cause hemorrhage.

6. **Metastatic Carcinoma to the Choroid**: Considered less likely without a history of systemic cancer but still in the differential due to age and intraocular mass.

7. **Primary Intraocular Lymphoma**: Lower down as it’s rare and steroid treatment effect may differ from clinical course seen here.

8. **Amelanotic Nevus**: Typically does not present with acute symptoms and exudation noted in this patient.

9. **Choroidal Granuloma**: Unlikely given the lack of systemic signs or history suggestive of tuberculosis or sarcoidosis.

10. **Choroidal Osteoma**: Uncommon and the clinical course and imaging findings are atypical for this condition.

By integrating all patient information, clinical features, imaging results, and response to initial treatment, choroidal melanoma remains the most probable diagnosis, with other differentials prioritized accordingly.","['Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Lung Cancer', 'Choroidal Disorders', 'Retinal Disorders']",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,65.0,F

### INPUT:
A patient in their 60s with a medical history of hypertension was referred for new-onset fluctuating diplopia and worsening right upper eyelid ptosis. The patient underwent right-sided ptosis repair at another hospital less than 1 year earlier without improvement. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/30 OU, and pupil examination revealed no anisocoria or afferent pupillary defect. Color vision was full in both eyes. External examination revealed a margin reflex distance 1 (MRD1) of 0 mm OD, 4 mm OS without fatigability in extended upgaze (Figure 1A). The patient had a small exotropia in primary gaze with a −2 supraduction deficit. No proptosis was observed. An ice pack was applied in the clinic to the ptotic eyelid for 2 minutes, which led to a 1.5-mm improvement (Figure 1B) in ptosis and no appreciable change in strabismus. The patient reported no associated headache, weakness, or difficulty swallowing.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Myasthenia Gravis** - Fluctuating diplopia, ptosis without fatigability, and positive ice pack test highly suggest myasthenia gravis.
   
2. **Oculomotor Nerve Palsy** - Ptosis and exotropia with supraduction deficit but less likely without pupil involvement.
   
3. **Microvascular Cranial Nerve Palsy** - Common in patients with hypertension, though less likely given fluctuating symptoms and response to ice pack test.
   
4. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)** - Considered due to progressive ophthalmoplegia but less likely given no proptosis and fluctuation in symptoms.
    
5. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - Can cause diplopia and ptosis; however, the improved ptosis with ice pack test points away from this diagnosis.
   
6. **Horner’s Syndrome** - Ptosis and miosis are hallmark features, but no anisocoria in this patient.
    
7. **Brainstem Lesion** - Possible but less likely without other neurological signs and normal color vision.
    
8. **Graves’ Ophthalmopathy** - Typically involves proptosis, which is not observed here.
   
9. **Orbital Myositis** - Less likely in absence of pain and inflammation.

### INPUT:
A teenaged boy presented to the outpatient clinic with a 1-year history of asymptomatic cutaneous lesions on the face that had progressively spread to the trunk and extremities. He also had asthenia and mild intermittent arthralgias. Physical examination revealed multiple millimetric erythematous to hyperpigmented monomorphic keratotic papules involving the head, trunk, and extremities. Symmetric annular brown erythematous plaques on the cheeks and temples were also seen. There were no vesicles or pustules (Figure, A and B). Laboratory investigations revealed a normal white blood cell count, mild anemia (hemoglobin level, 11.3 g/dL; normal level 12.50-15.50 g/dL; to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), hypocomplementemia, and moderate proteinuria. Autoimmune serology results showed raised levels of antinuclear antibodies (>1:160), anti-Smith antibodies, SSA/Ro antibodies, SSB/La antibodies, and anti-U1RNP antibodies. Anti-dsDNA antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, rheumatoid factor, IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibody, and anti-β2 glycoprotein 1 antibody results were negative.

### OUTPUT:
    ",Nonbullous neutrophilic lupus erythematosus,"Sure, let's proceed step by step to create a differential diagnosis for this case and then rank these based on the given patient information.

#### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
2. **Dermatomyositis**
3. **Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (SCLE)**
4. **Sarcoidosis**
5. **Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD)**
6. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)**
7. **Lichen Planus**
8. **Lupus Panniculitis**
9. **Antiphospholipid Syndrome**
10. **Erythema Multiforme**

#### Reranking based on the Patient Information:

1. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE):** This is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's serology results (high antinuclear antibodies, anti-Smith antibodies, SSA/Ro antibodies, SSB/La antibodies, and anti-U1RNP antibodies), hypocomplementemia, moderate proteinuria, and clinical features including cutaneous lesions and joint symptoms.

2. **Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (SCLE):** The symmetric annular erythematous plaques, mild arthralgias, and positive SSA/Ro antibodies are suggestive of SCLE, a variant of lupus with predominant skin involvement.

3. **Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD):** MCTD is characterized by the presence of anti-U1RNP antibodies and features overlapping SLE, scleroderma, and polymyositis, making it a considerable differential diagnosis given the positive anti-U1RNP antibody and systemic symptoms.

4. **Dermatomyositis:** Given the cutaneous involvement, arthralgias, and the possibility of systemic involvement, dermatomyositis should be considered, though the specificity of the antibodies points more towards lupus.

5. **Sarcoidosis:** The annular erythematous plaques and systemic involvement may mimic sarcoidosis, although the specific antibody profile and hypocomplementemia are less typical for this condition.

6. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides):** This disease can present with skin lesions that resemble those described, but does not account for the systemic symptoms and serological findings.

7. **Lichen Planus:** The skin lesions can sometimes resemble those of lichen planus, but the systemic symptoms and specific antibody profile are less consistent with this diagnosis.

8. **Lupus Panniculitis:** A form of lupus that presents with deep nodules and plaques, typically on the upper arms, face, and buttocks, but the patient's main described symptoms align more closely with systemic lupus.

9. **Antiphospholipid Syndrome:** This can occur in association with SLE and present with intermittent arthralgias and proteinuria, but it is generally characterized by recurrent thrombosis and pregnancy-related complications, which were not mentioned.

10. **Erythema Multiforme:** Typically presents with more acute and target-like lesions and is usually triggered by infections or medications; the chronic and progressive nature of the lesions and systemic symptoms in this case make it less likely.

Considering all provided information and test results, **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** remains the most likely diagnosis.","['Dermatology', 'Connective Tissue Disease of the Skin', 'Pediatrics', 'Adolescent Medicine']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1.0,M

### INPUT:
A 20-year-old woman presented with complaints of blurred vision in her left eye over several weeks and a growing, bulging left-eye mass. Her history was notable for bilateral colobomas involving the iris, optic nerve, and retina; congenital cataracts after lensectomy of the left eye; retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy of the left eye requiring a scleral buckle and silicone oil; and intractable glaucoma in the left eye requiring a superior trabeculectomy, an inferotemporal Ahmed tube implant, and multiple diode cyclophotocoagulation treatments. Because of the high risk of retinal redetachment, the silicone oil was retained throughout the glaucoma procedures. The patient presented 9 months after the last cyclophotocoagulation procedure. At presentation, she was taking dorzolamide-timolol, brimonidine, netarsudil, and latanoprost for her left eye. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 OD and light perception OS. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were 11 mm Hg OD and 20 mm Hg OS. Examination of the left eye revealed a large, firm, pink subconjunctival mass inferotemporally near the Ahmed valve (Figure 1). There was a left hypertropia of more than 45° by Hirschberg test. The anterior chamber was deep with fine silicone oil bubbles superiorly. The aphakic left eye revealed a well-positioned tube. Cup-disc ratios were 0.7 OD and 0.8 OS. The retina was centrally attached under silicone oil with a stable peripheral tractional retinal detachment. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Subconjunctival silicone oil granuloma,"Let's proceed with the differential diagnosis based on the patient’s presentation step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Conjunctival cyst:** Initial suspicion might arise due to the pink subconjunctival mass inferotemporally near the Ahmed valve.
2. **Blebitis:** The history of multiple glaucoma treatments and a subconjunctival mass could raise concern for infection related to prior surgical interventions.
3. **Conjunctival lymphoma:** The growing nature of the mass and its firmness may suggest a neoplastic process.
4. **Pyogenic granuloma:** This can present as a vascular, pink mass, especially after surgical procedures.
5. **Choroidal melanoma:** This could potentially spread to the subconjunctival space causing a mass effect.
6. **Orbital cellulitis:** Although more painful and typically with systemic symptoms, the location and inflammation could be considered.
7. **Orbital pseudotumor:** Inflammatory conditions like this can cause similar appearing masses.
8. **Retinoblastoma:** It's rare, especially in adults, but an intraocular mass with her history could be concerning.
9. **Metastatic disease:** Secondary tumors could present in similar fashions given her complex ocular history.
10. **Conjunctival Kaposi sarcoma:** More common in immunocompromised patients, but should be on the differential for any unexplained ocular mass.

### Rerank with Patient Information:

Given the detailed patient history and clinical findings, we can reorder the differential diagnoses more appropriately:

1. **Conjunctival lymphoma:** Given the characteristics of the mass (growing, firm, pink) and patient’s complex surgical history, this possibility rises up on our list.
   
2. **Pyogenic granuloma:** This is common after surgeries and matches well with the short duration and appearance of the mass.
   
3. **Blebitis:** Considering her history of glaucoma procedures and location of the mass near the Ahmed valve.
   
4. **Metastatic disease:** Due to the patient's history of multiple intraocular surgeries and systemic issues, metastatic disease should not be ruled out.
   
5. **Conjunctival cyst:** Though less likely given the firmness of the mass, cysts can sometimes present in this manner.
   
6. **Orbital pseudotumor:** An inflammatory pseudotumor is possible, given the history and presentation.
   
7. **Choroidal melanoma:** Given the ophthalmic history, intraocular malignancies could present with extruding masses.
   
8. **Conjunctival Kaposi sarcoma:** More likely in an immunocompromised individual, but still a differential given the appearance.
   
9. **Orbital cellulitis:** Unlikely without systemic signs, though infection-related complications from her surgeries can’t be ruled out entirely.
   
10. **Retinoblastoma:** Highly unlikely due to patient’s age but still considered due to the patient’s significant ocular history.

This revised differential diagnosis takes into account the history of complex ocular disease, multiple surgeries, appearance, and characteristics of the current presentation.","['Ophthalmology', 'Retinal Disorders']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,F

### INPUT:
A woman in her mid-20s presented with cardiogenic shock. On presentation, she was afebrile with cool extremities; her blood pressure was 75/51 mm Hg, heart rate was 147 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 99% on mechanical ventilation. Her chest examination revealed bilateral coarse breath sounds and distant heart sounds. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 10% with elevated filling pressures and no significant valvular abnormalities. Owing to hemodynamic instability, the patient was given venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with the peripheral ventricular assist device (pVAD) Impella CP (Abiomed) and was administered high-dose intravenous corticosteroids. Endomyocardial biopsy showed lymphocytic viral myocarditis. There was significant hemodynamic improvement within 48 hours; transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained and showed impressive recovery of the left ventricular function to an ejection fraction of 45%. As a result, ECMO was decannulated after 72 hours. Left pVAD support was maintained alone for another 24 hours. In the interim, her vitals remained unchanged, but the patient developed hematuria and laboratory parameters suggestive of hemolysis. Chest radiography showed pulmonary edema, and low-flow alarms sounded on the device console. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe mitral regurgitation (MR), and a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed to evaluate pVAD positioning (Figure and Video). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Iatrogenic mitral regurgitation,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Acute Viral Myocarditis** 
   - Given the endomyocardial biopsy results showing lymphocytic viral myocarditis and impaired ventricular function.
   
2. **Cardiogenic Shock**
   - Presenting signs include low blood pressure, high heart rate, cool extremities, and reduced ejection fraction.
   
3. **Severe Mitral Regurgitation (MR)**
   - Late echocardiogram findings indicate severe MR, contributing to hemodynamics instability.
   
4. **Pulmonary Edema**
   - Chest radiography indicating pulmonary edema, a common complication of heart failure and cardiogenic shock.
   
5. **Hemolysis**
   - Laboratory parameters and hematuria, potentially a complication of mechanical support devices like ECMO/pVAD.
   
6. **Device Malposition**
   - Low-flow alarms and severe MR on imaging suggesting possible positioning issues with the pVAD.
   
7. **Stress Cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo Syndrome)**
   - Considered due to acute and severe ventricular dysfunction in a young female with rapid recovery.
   
8. **Sepsis-induced Cardiomyopathy**
   - Less likely given afebrile state and lack of infection signs, but always considered in hemodynamically unstable patients.
   
9. **Autoimmune Myocarditis**
   - Consideration given the need for corticosteroids and lymphocytic infiltrate, though viral myocarditis is confirmed.
   
10. **Toxic Myocarditis**
    - Rule out history of substance abuse or toxic exposure, though less likely given viral etiology confirmed via biopsy.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Acute Viral Myocarditis** 
   - Biopsy confirmation, rapid response to corticosteroids, and initial presentation strongly support this diagnosis.
   
2. **Severe Mitral Regurgitation (MR)**
   - Severe MR detected on echocardiogram consistent with worsening hemodynamic status.
   
3. **Device Malposition**
   - Given low-flow alarms and severe MR, repositioning of the pVAD is critical.
   
4. **Pulmonary Edema**
   - Confirmed on chest radiograph, secondary to heart failure.
   
5. **Hemolysis**
   - Likely linked to mechanical trauma from the implanted device, evidenced by lab parameters and hematuria.
   
6. **Cardiogenic Shock**
   - Initial primary presentation, resolved with mechanical support and corticosteroids.
   
7. **Stress Cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo Syndrome)**
   - Differential based on rapid initial ventricular recovery but less likely due to clear viral myocarditis biopsy.
   
8. **Sepsis-induced Cardiomyopathy**
   - Still considered but less likely since infection markers and fever are absent.
   
9. **Autoimmune Myocarditis**
   - Lymphocytic infiltrate considered, but viral etiology confirmed.
   
10. **Toxic Myocarditis**
    - Less likely, considered only if there was a relevant history of exposure, which isn't noted here.","['Urology', 'Cardiology', 'Medical Devices and Equipment', 'Nephrology', 'Acute Coronary Syndromes']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,25.0,F

### INPUT:
A white man in his early 80s with history of autoimmune pancreatitis, recurrent colon polyps, and benign prostatic hyperplasia developed rapid, painless vision loss of both eyes over a 2-week period 6 months after cataract surgery. Vision was 20/250 OD and 20/60 OS. The anterior segment was unremarkable in either eye, while the posterior segment examination noted 1+ vitreous cell, asteroid hyalosis, and a multilobulated, serous retinal detachment (RD) in the right eye and trace vitreous cell and a multilobulated, serous RD in the left eye. Imaging included B-scan, optical coherence tomography, and fundus autofluorescence, which revealed diffuse choroidal and ciliary body thickening, multifocal pockets of subretinal fluid, and speckled hyperautofluorescence and hypoautofluorescence in both eyes (Figure 1). No poliosis or skin changes were noted. A review of systems was unremarkable, most notably a lack of any pulmonary symptoms. A focused laboratory evaluation identified a significantly elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level and antinuclear antibody titer, but serum lysozyme, syphilis, and tuberculosis testing had negative results. To better differentiate between Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, a lymphoproliferative disorder, or sarcoidosis as the underlying cause of the vitreous inflammation and multilobulated, serous RD in both eyes, a computed tomographic scan was performed. It showed marked lymphadenopathy throughout the mediastinum and diffuse scleral thickening in both eyes. The institute’s radiologists believed these computed tomography findings were nonspecific and could be indicative of either sarcoidosis or intraocular lymphoma. 
### OUTPUT:
    ","Biopsy-proven, Harada-like ocular sarcoidosis in both eyes","### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Sarcoidosis** - Given the elevated ACE levels, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and diffuse scleral thickening, sarcoidosis is a significant consideration.
   
2. **Primary Intraocular Lymphoma (PIOL)** - Due to the multilobulated, serous retinal detachment and B-scan findings, PIOL must be considered despite normal pulmonary symptoms.
   
3. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Syndrome** - The presence of bilateral serous retinal detachment and choroidal thickening make VKH a probable diagnosis.
   
4. **Autoimmune Uveitis** - A history of autoimmune pancreatitis and the presence of vitreous cells could indicate another autoimmune-related uveitis.
   
5. **Choroidal Melanoma** - Though less likely, the possibility of a melanoma presenting with choroidal thickening should be considered.
   
6. **Sympathetic Ophthalmia** - The timing after cataract surgery and bilateral findings could suggest a rare case of sympathetic ophthalmia.
   
7. **Metastatic Carcinoma** - Considering the patient's age, a metastatic process causing intraocular findings should be ruled out.
   
8. **Tubulointerstitial Nephritis and Uveitis (TINU) Syndrome** - Though rare, it can cause both ocular inflammation and systemic symptoms.
   
9. **Acute Posterior Multifocal Placoid Pigment Epitheliopathy (APMPPE)** - Multifocal subretinal fluid pockets and the pattern of autofluorescence changes might suggest this diagnosis.
   
10. **Syphilitic Uveitis** - Despite negative testing, consider repeating tests if the clinical suspicion remains high.

### Re-ranking Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Sarcoidosis** - Elevated ACE levels, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and nonspecific CT findings align strongly with sarcoidosis, making it the top consideration.
   
2. **Primary Intraocular Lymphoma (PIOL)** - Given the combination of vitreous cells, serous RD, and diffuse findings, PIOL remains high on the list.
   
3. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Syndrome** - Given the bilateral involvement and autoimmune history, VKH is also a strong contender.
   
4. **Autoimmune Uveitis** - The ocular findings combined with the patient's history of autoimmune pancreatitis support this diagnosis.
   
5. **Sympathetic Ophthalmia** - The timeframe post cataract surgery and bilateral features keep this as a differential, though lower in probability.
   
6. **Metastatic Carcinoma** - Age-related risk and the presentation necessitate this differential, though with less likelihood due to lack of systemic cancer history.
   
7. **Choroidal Melanoma** - Lesser likely due to multilobulated, serous RD presentation, but must be considered.
   
8. **Tubulointerstitial Nephritis and Uveitis (TINU) Syndrome** - Less likely without renal involvement or history, but still a consideration.
   
9. **Acute Posterior Multifocal Placoid Pigment Epitheliopathy (APMPPE)** - The ocular findings are slightly aligned, but lack of other systemic signs lowers probability.
   
10. **Syphilitic Uveitis** - Despite negative tests, remains in differential due to possibility of false negatives and mimicking presentation.","['Ophthalmology', 'Retinal Disorders']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,80.0,M

### INPUT:
A patient in their 50s presented with asymptomatic keratotic papules, first noticed on the left middle and ring fingers and left toe web spaces more than 10 years earlier. The papules progressed proximally over the subsequent decade to involve the forearm, arm, scapular area, ankle, shin, and thigh, but only affected the left side of the body. The patient’s face, palms, soles, and entire right side of the body were spared. The patient has a history of rosacea being treated with topical metronidazole gel for flares but was otherwise asymptomatic. The patient did not have any alopecia, night blindness, or dry eyes or skin. There was no history of any exposure to radiation or arsenic, nutritional deficiency, inflammatory skin disease, or malignant neoplasm. There was no family history of a similar condition. Examination revealed multiple, submillimeter, skin-colored to yellowish keratotic spiny projections over the aforementioned areas, only on the left side of the body (Figure, A and B). Punch biopsy from a lesion showed orthokeratosis with parakeratotic columns emerging from an epidermal invagination. The epidermis was mildly acanthotic and with a normal granular layer. There was a sparse superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Adjacent hair follicles were unaffected (Figure, C). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis,"Based on the detailed clinical presentation and biopsy findings, here is a 10-step differential diagnosis process:

1. **Linear Porokeratosis**: Given the unilateral distribution and keratotic nature of the lesions, and the biopsy showing parakeratotic columns within an epidermal invagination.

2. **Linear Epidermal Nevus**: Milder acanthosis and presence of orthokeratosis can be seen, but typically would have hypergranulosis rather than a normal granular layer.

3. **Nevus Comedonicus**: Presents similarly with keratotic lesions, but typically involves comedones rather than spiny projections, and biopsy would show keratin-filled invaginations without parakeratosis.

4. **Epidermolytic Hyperkeratosis**: Can present with keratotic lesions, but histologically shows epidermolytic changes which are not mentioned here.

5. **Lichen Nitidus**: May present with small papules, but typically are smooth and dome-shaped rather than spiny, and involves different histology.

6. **Focal Dermal Hypoplasia (Goltz Syndrome)**: Typically shows asymmetrical involvement, but histology and clinical presentation with fat herniation and atrophic skin are distinct.

7. **Acrokeratosis Verruciformis of Hopf**: Presents with keratotic papules, tends to involve dorsal hands and feet, histology is similar but more wart-like.

8. **Darier Disease**: Keratotic papules can be seen but usually has greasy scaly crusts, histology shows acantholytic dyskeratosis which is not described here.

9. **Unilateral Palmoplantar Verrucous Nevus**: Usually localized to palms or soles, with verrucous rather than spiny papules, histology is also different.

10. **Lichen Spinulosus**: Presents with keratotic spiny papules, however tends to be symmetrically distributed and often associated with hair follicles.

Upon thorough review and ranking of all differentials:

### INPUT:
A White woman in her 40s was referred to an outside ophthalmologist after developing nausea and a headache following a dilated eye examination. She was found to have narrow angles in both eyes and a laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) was performed in her left eye. Two weeks later she developed flickering photopsias and a temporal scotoma progressing to a “brown tint” of her vision in her left eye. Her vision had decreased in her left eye and macular and optic nerve edema were noted and she was subsequently referred to us. In our clinic, her visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/50 OS, and she had normal intraocular pressure, a shallow anterior chamber but open angle in both eyes, a patent LPI in the left eye, and clear crystalline lenses in both eyes. The rest of her anterior segment was unremarkable. The posterior examination was notable for shifting subretinal fluid with choroidal detachments without retinal breaks, inflammation, or optic nerve edema and leopard spotting, while her right eye was unremarkable (Figure, A). Fluorescein angiography was unrevealing, while optical coherence tomography showed shallow subretinal fluid and an irregular and thickened choroid (Figure, B). Ultrasonography showed an axial length of 20.0 mm, thickened sclera, anteriorly rotated ciliary body, and 360° of ciliochoroidal detachments in both eyes but worse in the left eye. Results of a systemic laboratory evaluation for infectious and noninfectious disorders were unremarkable. Systemic corticosteroids failed to resolve the subretinal fluid and her vision declined.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis
1. **Idiopathic Uveal Effusion Syndrome** - Given the specific findings of thickened sclera, shifted subretinal fluid, and choroidal detachments, this is the most consistent diagnosis.
2. **Posterior Scleritis** - Thickened sclera and anteriorly rotated ciliary body hint toward this, despite the lack of severe pain.
3. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Disease** - Although some features match, lack of systemic findings and laboratory evidence make it less likely.
4. **Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma** - The initial presentation and findings (narrow angles, LPI) fit here, but does not fully explain ongoing symptoms.
5. **Choroidal Detachment secondary to Hypotony** - Could be considered but intraocular pressures are normal.
6. **Posterior Uveitis** - Some overlapping features, but would expect inflammation signs in posterior segment.
7. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy** - The presentation aligns but doesn't fully explain bilateral choroidal detachments.
8. **Sympathetic Ophthalmia** - This is possible but rare, especially given unilateral intervention.
9. **Inflammatory Choroidal Neovascularization** - The chronic process and imaging findings are less consistent.
10. **Malignant Hypertension** - Systemic evaluation was unremarkable, so this is least likely.

By analyzing the presenting symptoms, imaging findings, and lack of response to corticosteroids, **Idiopathic Uveal Effusion Syndrome** appears to be the most fitting diagnosis for this patient.","['Glaucoma', 'Ophthalmology', 'Choroidal Disorders', 'Retinal Disorders']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,40.0,F

### INPUT:
A man aged 57 years presented to the emergency department after 3 weeks of bilateral periorbital pain and swelling with associated headaches. He reported diplopia and pain with extraocular movement. There were no constitutional, dermatologic, or neurologic symptoms. The patient endorsed a history of Crohn disease, and his medication had been changed from infliximab to ustekinumab 6 weeks prior owing to persistent intestinal inflammation. Clinical examination revealed bilateral periorbital edema, diplopia with decreased abduction in the right eye and decreased adduction in the left eye, chemosis, proptosis, and conjunctival hyperemia (Figure 1A). Visual acuity and neurologic and fundus examination findings were otherwise normal with no sign of optic neuropathy. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Medication-induced orbital myositis secondary to ustekinumab,"### Step by Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Orbital cellulitis**: Given the periorbital swelling, pain, and proptosis, this bacterial infection of the orbital tissues needs to be considered.
2. **Thyroid eye disease (Graves' ophthalmopathy)**: Characterized by bilateral proptosis and diplopia, though typically associated with thyroid dysfunction.
3. **Idiopathic orbital inflammation (Orbital pseudotumor)**: Non-infectious inflammatory process that can lead to bilateral orbital pain and proptosis.
4. **Sarcoidosis**: Can present with orbital involvement, although it often has systemic manifestations.
5. **Wegener's granulomatosis**: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis can affect orbital tissues and present with similar eye symptoms.
6. **Tolosa-Hunt syndrome**: Painful ophthalmoplegia due to inflammation of the cavernous sinus or superior orbital fissure.
7. **Lymphoma**: Orbital lymphoma can present with proptosis and periorbital swelling, considering the patient’s immunosuppressive background.
8. **Orbital metastases**: Given the systemic nature, metastatic disease could involve the orbit, although no history of primary malignancy here.
9. **Mucocele of the paranasal sinuses**: Can lead to compression symptoms of the orbit if large enough.
10. **Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the lacrimal gland**: Presents with progressive orbital symptoms and pain often delayed in onset.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

Based on the presentation, including bilateral periorbital pain and swelling, history of Crohn's disease, medications, clinical findings, and absence of systemic symptoms:

1. **Idiopathic orbital inflammation (Orbital pseudotumor)**: Strongly considered due to the bilateral nature, pain, and lack of systemic symptoms.
2. **Lymphoma**: A history of immunosuppression (Crohn's disease medications) raises concern for orbital lymphoma.
3. **Orbital cellulitis**: Although typically more acute, chronic cases need consideration especially with inflammation.
4. **Wegener's granulomatosis**: Given the potential for naso-orbital involvement and similar presentation.
5. **Tolosa-Hunt syndrome**: Given the painful ophthalmoplegia and cranial nerve involvement.
6. **Thyroid eye disease**: Though less likely given no thyroid disease history, still considerable for bilateral proptosis.
7. **Orbital metastases**: Systemic malignancies can metastasize to the orbit and cause similar pictures.
8. **Mucocele of the paranasal sinuses**: Can compress orbital structures and present similarly.
9. **Sarcoidosis**: Orbital and systemic involvement possible but less likely without other systemic disease signs.
10. **Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the lacrimal gland**: Rare and progresses slowly which might fit the timeline.","['Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology', 'Gastroenterology', 'Inflammatory Bowel Disease', 'Adverse Drug Events', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,57.0,M

### INPUT:
A woman in her 40s with a medical history of multiple sclerosis consulted for the sudden development of 2 adjacent nodules on the left arm. An excision with 1-cm margins of the left arm demonstrated desmoplastic melanoma with a Breslow thickness of 1 mm, and a left axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) had been performed 3 weeks before under general anesthesia. The patient was also being treated with subcutaneous interferon beta 1a for the multiple sclerosis. Physical examination revealed 2 indurated and mobile subcutaneous nodules on the anterior surface of the arm 5 cm distal to the surgical scar, the larger of them measuring 15 mm in diameter (Figure, A) and the smaller of them measuring 4 mm. When the arm was abducted to 90°, the patient denied pain but described a subtle tightness sensation on the arm. An excisional biopsy from the larger lesion was performed (Figure, B-D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Axillary web syndrome,"To proceed with a differential diagnosis, we can monitor the clinical data provided and step-by-step test results to arrive at the most likely diagnosis.

1. **Local Recurrence of Melanoma**: Given the patient's history of desmoplastic melanoma and the appearance of new nodules near the initial surgical site.
2. **Metastasis to Lymph Nodes or Soft Tissue**: It is important to consider the possibility of melanoma metastasis, especially in the setting of a positive SLNB.
3. **Lymphadenopathy**: This can occur secondary to the SLNB procedure or could be related to another underlying condition such as infection or inflammation.
4. **Infection or Abscess Based on Procedure History**: Infection could be linked to the recent surgeries and potentially complicated by immune-modulating treatment.
5. **Foreign Body Granuloma**: Reaction to suture material or other foreign bodies used during the surgical procedures.
6. **Subcutaneous Nodules Associated with Interferon Therapy**: Interferon therapy can sometimes cause local reactions manifesting as subcutaneous nodules.
7. **Lipoma**: Although less likely given the patient's history and presentation, benign lipomas could present as subcutaneous nodules.
8. **Systemic Sarcoidosis**: Could present with subcutaneous nodules and an underlying chronic disease such as multiple sclerosis might predispose to granulomatous diseases.
9. **Fibromatosis**: Benign growths in soft tissue could form as a result of surgical intervention trauma or chronic inflammation.
10. **Cutaneous Metastases from an Unknown Primary Cancer**: Although melanoma is the primary consideration, other cancers can metastasize to the skin.

### Rerank All 10 Differential Diagnoses Using All Information:

1. **Local Recurrence of Melanoma**: High likelihood due to history of melanoma and appearance of similar nodules.
2. **Metastasis to Lymph Nodes or Soft Tissue**: Likely due to known melanoma potential to metastasize and the location of nodules.
3. **Subcutaneous Nodules Associated with Interferon Therapy**: Considerable likelihood given the ongoing interferon treatment for multiple sclerosis.
4. **Foreign Body Granuloma**: Possible due to recent biopsies and likelihood of foreign material.
5. **Infection or Abscess Based on Procedure History**: Could develop post-surgery or due to immune modulation from interferon.
6. **Lymphadenopathy**: Possible due to previous SLNB and surgery.
7. **Fibromatosis**: Less likely but possible secondary to chronic inflammation from MS and surgeries.
8. **Systemic Sarcoidosis**: Uncommon but systemic conditions can present with skin manifestations.
9. **Lipoma**: Unlikely given more probable potential diagnoses but possible.
10. **Cutaneous Metastases from an Unknown Primary Cancer**: Least likely provided a known primary cancer with a higher likelihood of recurrence.

### INPUT:
A man in his 40s was seen in clinic for a long history of palpitations. He had a history of cardiac arrest after receiving adenosine for sustained supraventricular tachycardia and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. The patient was also noted to have episodes of atrial flutter. Transthoracic echocardiogram displayed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 63% and mild aortic and mitral regurgitation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in sinus rhythm showed mild left ventricle thickening (up to 14 mm) and was otherwise normal. The patient was hospitalized for initiation of sotalol, given that he experienced frequent episodes of atrial arrhythmia. Figure 1A shows sinus rhythm prior to sotalol initiation. Figure 1B shows telemetry during administration of sotalol. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Latent accessory pathway (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome),"### Initial Differential Diagnosis (10 Steps):

1. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy**:
   - Reasoning: Mild left ventricular thickening observed; history of arrhythmias.

2. **Atrial Fibrillation**:
   - Reasoning: Frequent episodes of atrial arrhythmia; noted history of palpitations.

3. **AVNRT (Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia)**:
   - Reasoning: History of sustained supraventricular tachycardia; adenosine administration.

4. **Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome**:
   - Reasoning: Recurrent supraventricular tachycardia; consider a pre-excitation syndrome.

5. **Brugada Syndrome**:
   - Reasoning: History of cardiac arrest; need to rule out idiopathic ventricular fibrillation syndromes.

6. **Dilated Cardiomyopathy**:
   - Reasoning: History of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy; might have progressed.

7. **Atrial Flutter**:
   - Reasoning: Documented episodes of atrial flutter.

8. **Sarcoidosis**:
   - Reasoning: Non-specific thickening of LV; possible infiltrative cardiomyopathy.

9. **Long QT Syndrome**:
   - Reasoning: Initiation of sotalol which affects QT interval; history of cardiac event after adenosine.

10. **Myocarditis**:
   - Reasoning: Need to rule out infectious or inflammatory causes of cardiac symptoms and LV thickening.

### Re-ranked Differential Diagnosis:

After considering the entire clinical scenario along with patient history, physical examination findings, and diagnostic test results, the differential diagnoses are reranked based on likelihood:

1. **Atrial Flutter**:
   - Most directly supported by the clinical history and episodic atrial arrhythmias.

2. **Atrial Fibrillation**:
   - Common cause of palpitations and history of atrial arrhythmias.

3. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy**:
   - Mild left ventricular thickening up to 14 mm points towards this diagnosis.

4. **AVNRT (Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia)**:
   - History of supraventricular tachycardia; can present with similar symptoms.

5. **Brugada Syndrome**:
   - Given history of cardiac arrest after adenosine, need to rule this out.

6. **Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome**:
   - Consideration for recurrent SVT; however, less typical presentation.

7. **Long QT Syndrome**:
   - Important given the initiation of sotalol, but requires specific ECG changes.

8. **Sarcoidosis**:
   - Infiltrative disease considerations due to mild LV thickening, less likely without other systemic symptoms.

9. **Dilated Cardiomyopathy**:
   - History of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, but current LV function is relatively preserved.

10. **Myocarditis**:
    - Least likely without more direct evidence of infection or inflammation.

### INPUT:
A 55-year-old man with advanced primary open-angle glaucoma presented with 1 day of decreased vision and eye pain. He had undergone trabeculectomy and 5-fluorouracil injection 1 month prior. On initial examination, his visual acuity was 20/25. He had diffuse conjunctival hyperemia without bleb purulence or leakage and more than 50 cells per high-power field of a 1 × 1-mm area of light on slitlamp biomicroscopy. He was treated for blebitis with topical fortified antibiotics but subsequently developed vitritis. He underwent vitreous tap and injection of vancomycin and amikacin followed by pars plana vitrectomy with bleb revision. Separate vitreous samples from each procedure were sent for Gram stain and bacterial and fungal culture on chocolate and Sabouraud agar with no growth. His eye pain worsened significantly, and ultrasound biomicroscopy showed scleral thickening (Figure 1A). Lab workup for autoimmune scleritis including tests for rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies was negative. He was admitted to the hospital and started intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam treatment. His vision continued to decline to counting fingers because of the development of a dense cataract with retrolenticular plaque (Figure 1B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Aspergillus fumigatus endophthalmitis and scleritis,"To establish a differential diagnosis for the 55-year-old man with advanced primary open-angle glaucoma who presents with decreased vision, eye pain, and complications post-trabeculectomy, here is a step-by-step approach based on the available patient information:

### Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps:
1. **Postoperative Endophthalmitis** - Common complication following eye surgery characterized by inflammation within the eye.
2. **Sterile Endophthalmitis** - Inflammation without infectious etiology, possibly triggered by surgery or medication.
3. **Bleb-Associated Endophthalmitis** - Infection of the filtering bleb created during trabeculectomy.
4. **Bleb Leaks and Hypotony** - Post-surgical complications where the bleb leaks, leading to low intraocular pressure and vision issues.
5. **Non-infectious Uveitis/Scleritis** - Inflammation of the uveal tract or sclera, can be due to autoimmune conditions.
6. **Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS)** - Inflammatory response to non-infectious agents introduced into the anterior chamber during surgery.
7. **Retinal Detachment** - Can occur after eye surgeries, leading to vision loss and pain.
8. **Cataract Formation/Post-surgical Cataract** - Surgery or inflammation can induce cataract formation.
9. **Chronic Blebitis** - Persistent inflammation and infection of the bleb leading to complications.
10. **Phthisis Bulbi** - End-stage eye disease with shrinking and dysfunction of the eye after severe conditions or surgeries.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on Patient Information and Test Results:

**1. Sterile Endophthalmitis:** Given negative cultures from vitreous samples and inflammation without purulent exudate, a sterile inflammation is highly probable.
**2. Non-infectious Uveitis/Scleritis:** Lab tests were negative for autoimmune markers, yet the scleral thickening on ultrasound suggests non-infectious scleritis.
**3. Cataract Formation/Post-surgical Cataract:** Development of a dense cataract with retrolenticular plaque leading to significant vision decline.
**4. Postoperative Endophthalmitis:** Initially treated as infectious with antibiotics, though cultures were negative.
**5. Bleb-Associated Endophthalmitis:** Frequently happens post-trabeculectomy, but absence of bleb purulence points away from it.
**6. Phthisis Bulbi:** Considering worsening eye pain, vision decline, and scleral thickening, could indicate progression towards this end-stage eye.
**7. Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS):** Post-surgical inflammation could be non-infectious as TASS.
**8. Chronic Blebitis:** Recurrent inflammation without overt pus, though less likely due to significant visual decline.
**9. Retinal Detachment:** Less likely given the absence of typical detachment signs on initial imaging and examination.
**10. Bleb Leaks and Hypotony:** Was not strongly supported by examination indicating no leakage.

This list will help prioritize further diagnostic evaluations and therapeutic interventions tailored to the patient's current presentation and progression.","['Fungal Infections', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Ophthalmology', 'Glaucoma']",0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,55.0,M

### INPUT:
A 57-year-old man presented to the emergency department with 5 months of epigastric pain and a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss. He had no fevers or night sweats. Physical examination was notable for oral thrush and mild epigastric tenderness. Results of a fourth-generation HIV Ab/Ag combination assay were positive, and subsequent testing showed a CD4 cell count of 16/mm3 and an HIV viral load greater than 10 million copies/mL. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed thickening of the walls of the stomach, duodenum, and colon as well as multiple masses in the right hepatic lobe measuring up to 6.9 cm in diameter. A core biopsy of one of the liver masses demonstrated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. He started antiretroviral therapy with bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir/alafenamide and chemotherapy with rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (R-EPOCH). Four weeks after initiation of chemotherapy, the patient developed sudden onset of bright red blood per rectum, tachycardia, and hypotension. Mesenteric computed tomography angiography demonstrated active extravasation in the jejunum from a branch of the superior mesenteric artery. After unsuccessful coil embolization, he underwent open resection of 40 cm of distal small intestine; pathological examination of a stained section showed acute inflammation of the lamina propria, with crypt epithelial apoptosis and numerous cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions with an “owl eye” appearance (Figure 1, left panel). Five weeks later, he developed blurred vision, and visual acuity testing revealed 20/50 vision in the left eye and 20/70 in the right eye. A dilated retinal examination revealed extensive macular hemorrhage in the left eye, with peripapillary whitening and perivascular hemorrhage with whitening along the superior vascular arcade (Figure, right panel). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis and hemorrhagic enteritis,"Given the intricate and evolving clinical scenario, we'll start with the initial list of differential diagnoses based on presenting symptoms and progressively refine our understanding based on further diagnostic revelations until we reach a final, refined list.

### Initial Differential Diagnosis

1. **Epigastric Pain and Weight Loss:**
   - **Gastric Cancer**

2. **Oral Thrush and Immunocompromised State:**
   - **HIV/AIDS**

3. **HIV Positive with Low CD4 Count and High Viral Load:**
   - **Opportunistic Infections (e.g., Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia)**

4. **Thickening of Stomach, Duodenum, Colon and Liver Masses:**
   - **Lymphoma**

5. **Patient Undergoing Chemotherapy with R-EPOCH regimen:**
   - **Drug-induced Mucositis**

6. **Acute GI Bleeding with Histology Showing “Owl Eye” Inclusions:**
   - **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection**

7. **Post-Chemotherapy Blurred Vision and Retinal Changes:**
   - **CMV Retinitis**

8. **Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) post-ART:**
   - **IRIS**

9. **Persistent Epigastric Pain despite Negative Cancer Screening and GI Symptoms:**
   - **Peptic Ulcer Disease**

10. **Complicated HIV and AIDS with Systemic Inflammatory Findings:**
    - **Disseminated Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC)**

### Reranked Final Differential Diagnosis

Based on the more comprehensive information and specific test results provided, this would be the most likely sequence of differential diagnoses:

1. **Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (confirmed via biopsy of the liver masses)**
2. **HIV/AIDS (confirmed via HIV Ab/Ag testing and viral load/CD4 count)**
3. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (owl eye inclusion bodies found in biopsy)**
4. **CMV Retinitis (blurred vision and characteristic retinal findings)**
5. **Opportunistic Infections (general category for varied infections due to low CD4 counts)**
6. **Drug-induced Mucositis (due to chemotherapy with R-EPOCH)**
7. **Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS post-ART initiation)**
8. **Peptic Ulcer Disease (differential for persistent epigastric pain)**
9. **Disseminated Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC) (less likely based on the specific findings)**
10. **Gastric Cancer (initial considered due to epigastric pain and weight loss, but ruled out later due to other diagnostic confirmations)**

### Conclusion
The key diagnosis for this patient is **Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma** and **HIV/AIDS** with secondary complications from **CMV infection** and **CMV Retinitis**, alongside treatment-related side effects and possible secondary opportunistic infections and conditions due to profound immunosuppression.

A 49-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, intravenous drug abuse, and multiple sexual partners presented to the emergency department with painless vision loss in both eyes for 10 days, left eye worse than right eye, and photophobia in both eyes. His visual acuity was count fingers OD and 20/70 OS. Intraocular pressure was 20 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. There were 1+ (10-12 cells/high-power field) anterior chamber cells in both eyes with very hazy posterior pole details in the right eye and minimal vitreous haze in the left eye. There was a hazy view to the posterior pole in the right eye with disc edema and multiple flame hemorrhages surrounding the nerve. Examination of the posterior pole in the left eye revealed partial obstruction of all vessels and a complete halo on the disc with numerous flame hemorrhages emanating from and surrounding the optic nerve, along with a few dot blot hemorrhages within the macula (Figure). His blood pressure was 173/137 mm Hg, but the rest of his vital signs were normal. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Syphilitic panuveitis and optic neuritis,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis

1. **Diabetic Retinopathy**
2. **Hypertensive Retinopathy**
3. **HIV Retinopathy** (due to history of multiple sexual partners and intravenous drug use)
4. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis** (considering immunocompromised status from potential HIV)
5. **Syphilitic Uveitis** (due to risky sexual behavior)
6. **Endogenous Endophthalmitis** (due to intravenous drug use)
7. **Toxoplasmic Retinochoroiditis**
8. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)**
9. **Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma with Ocular Involvement**
10. **Sarcoidosis with Ocular Involvement**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis after Considering All Patient Information

1. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis**
    - The patient's history of intravenous drug use and multiple sexual partners increases the likelihood of being immunocompromised (e.g., HIV/AIDS). CMV retinitis is common in individuals with advanced immunosuppression.

2. **HIV Retinopathy**
    - History suggests a potential HIV infection, which could manifest as HIV retinopathy.

3. **Syphilitic Uveitis**
    - Due to the patient's high-risk sexual behavior, syphilitic uveitis remains a significant consideration.

4. **Diabetic Retinopathy**
    - The patient's diabetes and the ocular presentations are characteristic of this condition.

5. **Endogenous Endophthalmitis**
    - Intravenous drug abuse increases the risk of systemic infections that can seed the eye, leading to endogenous endophthalmitis.

6. **Hypertensive Retinopathy**
    - The significantly elevated blood pressure (173/137 mm Hg) aligns with findings of hypertensive retinopathy.

7. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)**
    - The symptoms and examination findings, particularly the hemorrhages, are consistent with CRVO.

8. **Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma with Ocular Involvement**
    - Considered due to possibility of systemic malignancies that can affect the eye.

9. **Toxoplasmic Retinochoroiditis**
    - Although less likely given the other findings and history, it should still be considered.

10. **Sarcoidosis with Ocular Involvement**
    - Due to multifocal presentation and possible systemic involvement, though less likely here based on patient's risk factors.

In rethinking these diagnoses, it's clear that immunocompromising conditions such as HIV/AIDS (possibly disclosed through behaviors like IV drug use and multiple sexual partners) top the list, particularly leading to opportunistic infections such as CMV retinitis and HIV retinopathy.","['Infectious Diseases', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections', 'Retinal Disorders', 'Ophthalmology']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,49.0,M

### INPUT:
A male in his late teens presented with asymptomatic congenital papules, plaques, and nodules in a linear bilateral distribution following Blaschko lines on the scalp and face region. The papules and nodules appeared to grow as the boy grew, and some pedunculated lesions tended to fall off spontaneously. He had not received any prior treatment. The patient had no other significant medical history and denied having a family history of similar lesions. Clinical examination findings revealed multiple skin-colored, nontender soft papules of varying sizes protruding from the skin surface on the right cheek, forehead, and jaw, as well as on the anterior surface of the scalp, distributed along Blaschko lines, with sparse vellus hairs and multiple hair follicles on the lesions (Figure, A and B). However, no hair was observed on the lesion because the patient had shaved the hair on his face. An incisional biopsy of a pedunculated lesion above the left eyebrow was performed (Figure, B).

6. **Pilomatricoma**
7. **Juvenile Xanthogranuloma**
8. **Neurofibromatosis**
9. **Keratoacanthoma**
10. **Intradermal Nevus**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on Complete Information

1. **Epidermal Nevus** - Consistent with the presentation of congenital lesions following Blaschko lines, which are characteristic of this type of nevus.
2. **Nevus Sebaceous** - Presents with congenital papules and nodules often located on the scalp and face, potentially explaining the hair follicle involvement and growth with patient age.
3. **Syringocystadenoma Papilliferum** - Often arises within nevus sebaceous and can present similarly on the scalp and face but typically shows a more nodular or cystic appearance.
4. **Trichofolliculoma** - Hair follicle tumors that could explain the multiple hair follicles and the pedunculated nature of the lesions.
5. **Juvenile Xanthogranuloma** - Typically presents in children and could present with papules and nodules, but less likely to follow Blaschko lines.
6. **Intradermal Nevus** - Common benign growth but less likely to have a linear, bilateral distribution along Blaschko lines.
7. **Seborrheic Keratosis** - May present as papules but usually occurs later in life and not typically in a congenital, linear pattern.
8. **Pilomatricoma** - Typically solitary calcified nodules, thus less likely given the bilateral distribution.
9. **Keratoacanthoma** - Generally presents as a solitary lesion, usually not congenital.
10. **Neurofibromatosis** - Characterized by café-au-lait spots and neurofibromas rather than the papules and nodules described, and usually involves a family history.

The reranking considers the typical presentation, age of onset, and specific distribution pattern of the lesions observed. The biopsy results will further help to pinpoint the exact diagnosis but, based on current information, Epidermal Nevus tops the list.","['Dermatology', 'Hair Disorders', 'Nevi', 'Pediatrics', 'Adolescent Medicine']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1.0,M

10. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**
   - The age, broad spectrum of neurological symptoms (headache, dysarthria, double vision, dizziness), and MRI findings with T2 hyperintense lesions are consistent with MS, particularly since it is a common cause of such presentations in young individuals.

2. **Brainstem Glioma**
   - The location and appearance of the lesion are characteristic of a brainstem glioma, although the absence of rapid progression and more severe localization symptoms might weigh against this.

3. **Infectious Encephalitis (due to a virus or bacteria)**
   - The patient’s travel history could be indicative of an infectious etiology, though lack of fever and systemic symptoms is less supportive.

4. **Primary CNS Lymphoma**
   - Broad neurological signs and lesion characteristics could align with CNS lymphoma, though it is less common in a young, previously healthy individual with such a presentation and without known immunosuppression.

5. **Stroke (Ischemic or Hemorrhagic)**
   - The hyperintense lesion in the pons could indicate a stroke, although the clinical presentation and imaging without diffusion restriction make this less likely.

6. **Neuro-Behçet’s Disease**
   - Could explain focal neurological deficits, but absence of systemic signs like oral/genital ulcers makes it less likely.

7. **Neurosarcoidosis**
   - Less common, could present with CNS involvement without other systemic signs but can mimic various neurological conditions.

8. **Wernicke's Encephalopathy**
   - Presents with neurological symptoms, though typically associated with a nutritional deficiency which wasn’t indicated in the history.

9. **Relapsing-Remitting Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (RIPD)**
   - A rare cause for this particular pattern, but could explain varied neurological deficits.

10. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**
    - Presents with diverse neurological symptoms but generally would expect systemic signs of an underlying malignancy which are absent.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 20s was referred for evaluation of a 4-year history of recurrent pustular eruptions on her face, which initially presented while she was vacationing in Florida. She noted mild associated pruritus but denied burning sensation. The eruptions occurred intermittently, appearing as erythematous papules with prominent pustules, and were exacerbated by sunlight. On average, her lesions would resolve in 3 to 4 days with only mild background erythema by 5 to 7 days. Even mild sun exposure would induce the eruption, leading to frequent recurrences in summer months but long periods of remission in the fall through spring. Trials with various broad-spectrum sunscreens in combination with topical and oral antibiotics and topical ivermectin did not prevent flares or mitigate severity of eruptions when they occurred. She denied joint pain, fever, fatigue, changes in urine color, use of other topical or systemic medications, or presence of rashes elsewhere. She was otherwise healthy without other medical history. On physical examination, she was well appearing with numerous 1- to 2-mm monomorphous pustules over background erythema on the medial cheeks, chin, and nose (Figure, A). No nail fold capillary changes or mucosal lesions were observed. Serum analysis results for antinuclear, anti-SSA/Ro, and anti-SSB/La antibodies were negative. A 4-mm punch biopsy was taken from a representative lesion along the right jawline (Figure, B-D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Actinic folliculitis,"Sure, let’s go through the differential diagnosis step by step:

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Polymorphous Light Eruption (PMLE)**
2. **Acne Vulgaris**
3. **Rosacea**
4. **Pustular Psoriasis**
5. **Lupus Miliaris Disseminatus Faciei**
6. **Malassezia (Pityrosporum) Folliculitis**
7. **Contact Dermatitis**
8. **Seborrheic Dermatitis**
9. **Demodicosis**
10. **Hidradenitis Suppurativa**

### Reranking with Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Polymorphous Light Eruption (PMLE):** Given the exacerbation by sunlight, the seasonal pattern of appearance and remission, and the nature of erythematous pustular eruptions, PMLE is the most likely diagnosis.
   
2. **Acne Vulgaris:** While acne can present with pustules and erythema, its association with sunlight and seasonal variation makes it less likely.

3. **Rosacea:** Rosacea can present with pustules and erythema and can worsen with sunlight. However, the lack of telangiectasia and classic distribution lowers its priority.

4. **Malassezia (Pityrosporum) Folliculitis:** This can present similarly to acne and is often associated with humid climates like Florida, yet it's less likely without history of scaling, itching, or a positive KOH test.

5. **Pustular Psoriasis:** This is less likely due to its usual appearance in areas other than the face, and its more chronic, non-seasonal nature.

6. **Seborrheic Dermatitis:** It could present with erythematous lesions, particularly on sebaceous-rich areas like the nose and cheeks, but it wouldn't typically present with pustules and the seasonal pattern is less common.

7. **Demodicosis:** Caused by Demodex mites, it can result in pustular eruptions, but again, the clear seasonal pattern and sunlight exacerbation are less consistent.

8. **Lupus Miliaris Disseminatus Faciei:** Could present similarly with pustules and erythema, notable more for chronicity and less clear seasonal pattern.

9. **Contact Dermatitis:** Unlikely due to the lack of response to broad-spectrum sunscreens and antibiotics, and a typically more pruritic nature.
  
10. **Hidradenitis Suppurativa:** Unlikely as it commonly affects intertriginous areas (axilla, groin) and doesn't have the seasonal or sunlight-related pattern.

### Conclusion:
The most likely diagnosis given the patient history and clinical examination is Polymorphous Light Eruption (PMLE). Further tests like phototesting or photopatch testing could be done to confirm PMLE.",['Dermatology'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,F

### INPUT:
A 39-year-old healthy woman without family history of malignancy found a mass in her right breast at 38 weeks of pregnancy. Prior to delivery, she underwent diagnostic ultrasound of the right breast, which showed a possible mass in the location of the palpable lesion that was most consistent with a normal island of fibroglandular tissue. Follow-up mammogram and ultrasound of the right breast (without axillary evaluation) were performed 6 months later, which showed an irregular 17-mm mass with associated pleomorphic calcifications in the same area. Ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed. Pathology showed high-grade, estrogen receptor–positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). On postbiopsy physical examination, the patient had a palpable 2.5-cm right breast mass at the 3-o’clock position without palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. Surgical treatment with lumpectomy was recommended, and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed prior to surgery to evaluate the extent of disease (Figure). Axial T2-weighted MRI at the level of the axilla revealed edema surrounding 2 enlarged, morphologically abnormal right level-1 axillary lymph nodes; axial postcontrast T1 fat-saturated MRI of the right breast revealed an irregular mass with irregular margins at the site of biopsy-proven DCIS. The patient reported receiving her second dose of COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) in the right arm the day before the breast MRI. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Vaccination-associated reactive lymphadenopathy,"### Stepwise Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS)** - Diagnosed through biopsy, high-grade, estrogen receptor–positive.
2. **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma** - To be considered if there are aggressive features or invasive components.
3. **Fibroadenoma** - Could present as a palpable mass, though less likely with irregular margins and calcifications.
4. **Phyllodes Tumor** - A rarer breast tumor that can present with similar characteristics on imaging.
5. **Breast Abscess** - Less likely given mammogram and ultrasound features but could account for mass and lymphadenopathy.
6. **Fat Necrosis** - Can mimic malignancy on imaging.
7. **Lobular Carcinoma in Situ (LCIS)** - Often found incidentally, can present similarly on imaging.
8. **Granulomatous Mastitis** - Rare, inflammatory condition; patient's vaccine history could influence this.
9. **Benign Post-Vaccination Lymphadenopathy** - Given recent COVID-19 vaccination, consider this for axillary lymph node findings.
10. **Metastatic Disease** - Though no family history, consider due to aggressive imaging findings.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS)** - Confirmed diagnosis via biopsy.
2. **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma** - Needs further pathology to rule out any invasive component.
3. **Benign Post-Vaccination Lymphadenopathy** - Recent COVID-19 vaccine history strongly supports this for lymph node changes.
4. **Granulomatous Mastitis** - Inflammatory changes could be due to recent events (e.g., vaccination).
5. **Phyllodes Tumor** - Rare but has similar imaging features.
6. **Lobular Carcinoma in Situ (LCIS)** - Another non-invasive cancer, generally doesn't present with palpable masses but considered.
7. **Fat Necrosis** - Could mimic malignancy on imaging, though less likely given biopsy results.
8. **Fibroadenoma** - Less likely due to irregular, calcified nature of the mass.
9. **Breast Abscess** - Least likely given current imaging and pathology.
10. **Metastatic Disease** - Low likelihood given no family history and less common presenting features.

### INPUT:
A 12-year-old girl presented for assessment of abnormal gait. A year prior, she was found to have bilateral panuveitis with occlusive retinal periphlebitis involving all quadrants of the central and peripheral retina with capillary nonperfusion (Figure 1). Her subsequent workup revealed elevated inflammatory markers and subcentimeter chest and abdominal lymph nodes. Given a positive interferon-γ release assay, therapy was initiated with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol (RIPE) and corticosteroids for presumed tuberculosis. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pediatric neurosarcoidosis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Tuberculosis (TB):** Given her initial presentation with bilateral panuveitis, occlusive retinal periphlebitis, elevated inflammatory markers, subcentimeter lymph nodes, and a positive interferon-γ release assay, TB was initially diagnosed and treated.
   
2. **Sarcoidosis:** The presence of bilateral uveitis, elevated inflammatory markers, and lymphadenopathy is consistent with sarcoidosis.

3. **Behçet's Disease:** Panuveitis and vasculitis are common in Behçet's disease, which also often affects younger individuals.

4. **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA):** Patients with JIA can present with uveitis. The presence of systemic inflammation also aligns with this diagnosis.

5. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Disease:** This condition can cause bilateral panuveitis and has systemic manifestations similar to those seen in the patient's case.

6. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE):** SLE can present with a wide array of symptoms, including uveitis, systemic inflammation, and lymphadenopathy.

7. **Lymphoma:** The presence of lymphadenopathy, systemic inflammation, and retinal involvement may suggest an underlying malignancy such as lymphoma.

8. **Infectious Diseases (other than TB):** Various infectious agents (e.g., Bartonella, Syphilis) can cause similar eye inflammation and systemic symptoms.

9. **Idiopathic Uveitis:** When no other systemic cause is identified, idiopathic uveitis is considered.

10. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's):** This vasculitis can cause both eye involvement and systemic symptoms including lymphadenopathy.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Considering All Information and Test Results

After analyzing all patient information and test results, here’s the reranked differential diagnosis:

1. **Tuberculosis (TB):** Given the positive interferon-γ release assay and initial response to anti-TB therapy.
   
2. **Sarcoidosis:** Due to the bilateral panuveitis, systemic inflammation, and lymphadenopathy, this remains a strong consideration.

3. **Behçet's Disease:** Young age, panuveitis, and vasculitis keep this in consideration.

4. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Disease:** The constellation of systemic symptoms and eye involvement fits this diagnosis.

5. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE):** Although less likely than the above, the multisystem involvement and uveitis suggest it should still be considered.

6. **Lymphoma:** Rare, but the systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy warrant keeping it in the differential.

7. **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA):** Given the uveitis and systemic inflammation, it stays in the differential but is less likely without joint symptoms.

8. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's):** The possibility of vasculitis and systemic involvement keeps it in consideration.

9. **Infectious Diseases (other than TB):** Considering the positive TB test, other infectious agents drop in the list, but are not completely ruled out.

10. **Idiopathic Uveitis:** Considered when all other diagnoses are ruled out.

Considering the scope of the initial findings, it appears that despite the potential for other serious conditions, the treatment path initiated with TB being the probable diagnosis was appropriate. Further tests and monitoring should continue to confirm or adjust the course as additional symptoms or test results arise.","['Adolescent Medicine', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Intraocular Inflammation']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,12.0,F

### INPUT:
A 51-year-old woman presented with a 1-month history of intense and worsening polyarthralgia and swelling of bilateral fingers and toes. There was no history of alopecia, oral ulcers, rashes, or Raynaud phenomenon. She did not report preceding fever, diarrhea, or dysuria. There was no history of weight loss or anorexia. Medical history included tertiary hyperparathyroidism related to end-stage kidney disease from chronic glomerulonephritis. The patient had successfully received an ABO-incompatible kidney transplant 1 year ago, but this was complicated by invasive fungal (Volvariella volvacea) infection of the central nervous system. Medications included tacrolimus (0.5 mg twice daily), prednisolone (10 mg daily), cinacalcet (12.5 mg daily), and voriconazole (500 mg daily). On examination, her fingers and toes were symmetrically and diffusely swollen and tender. There was no rash, enthesitis, psoriatic nail changes, clubbing, or lower limb edema. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Alkaline phosphatase level was elevated at 640 U/L (10.69 μkat/L) (reference range, 40-130 U/L [0.67-2.17 μkat/L]). Corrected calcium and parathyroid hormone levels were 10.88 mg/dL (2.71 mmol/L) (reference range, 8.6-10.2 mg/dL [2.15-2.55 mmol/L]) and 23.7 pmol/L (reference range, 1.3-9.3), respectively. Serum bilirubin, aspartate transferase, alanine transferase, creatinine, and phosphate levels were within reference ranges. Free thyroxine and thyrotropin levels were normal. Results of testing for rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibody were negative. Her chest radiograph was unremarkable. Radiography of her hands was performed (Figure). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Voriconazole-induced periostitis,"### Initial Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)**
   - Despite negative rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies, seronegative RA can still be considered given the symmetrical swelling and tenderness.

2. **Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA)**
   - Polyarthralgia and finger swelling raise the suspicion for PsA, although there are no skin or nail changes at present.

3. **Gout**
   - This could be considered given polyarthralgia, but absence of acute inflammatory episodes and joint aspiration not done yet for crystal analysis.

4. **Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition Disease (CPPD)**
   - Given the patient's history of hyperparathyroidism and elevated calcium levels, CPPD could present as polyarthralgia.

5. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
   - Though no classic signs, SLE can present variably and could be considered given widespread joint involvement.

6. **Reactive Arthritis**
   - Considered given polyarthralgia, though absence of preceding infection history lowers its likelihood.

7. **Vasculitis**
   - Given kidney transplant and immunosuppressive therapy, vasculitis could be a differential, though no systemic signs are present.

8. **Infective Endocarditis**
   - Immunosuppressed state with kidney transplant could predispose to infective endocarditis presenting with polyarthralgia.

9. **Drug-Induced Arthralgia**
   - Given multiple medications, one causing arthralgia is possible (e.g., voriconazole).

10. **Amyloidosis**
    - Secondary amyloidosis can present with polyarthralgia and should be considered.

### Re-ranked Differential Diagnoses Based on All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition Disease (CPPD)**
   - Elevated calcium and parathyroid hormone levels with hyperparathyroidism history and bilateral symmetrical joint involvement support CPPD.

2. **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)**
   - Despite the negative antibodies, the bilateral symmetrical presentation keeps RA high on the list.

3. **Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA)**
   - Still a consideration due to polyarthralgia and joint swelling, though no skin/nail findings are evident.

4. **Drug-Induced Arthralgia**
   - Various medications, especially long-term immunosuppressants, could contribute to polyarthralgia.

5. **Amyloidosis**
   - Potential due to chronic kidney disease background and possible secondary amyloidosis.

6. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
   - Needs to be in consideration due to its variable presentation.

7. **Infective Endocarditis**
   - Though less likely without systemic signs, the immunosuppressed state warrants its consideration.

8. **Reactive Arthritis**
   - Lower on the differential due to the absence of preceding infection history.

9. **Gout**
   - Lower given the absence of classic acute inflammatory episodes and the requirement of crystal analysis for confirmation.

10. **Vasculitis**
    - Less likely without systemic signs but considered due to immunosuppression.

A 58-year-old man was referred for evaluation of a retinal detachment in his left eye. His visual acuity on presentation was 20/20 in the right eye and hand motion only in the left eye. Examination of the right eye was normal. Anterior segment examination of the left eye revealed around 30 cells per high-power field of a 1 mm × 1 mm light beam and diffuse stellate-appearing keratic precipitates. Posterior examination results showed a vitreous cell that precluded a clear view of the posterior pole and inferior snow banking.

### Reranking Using All Patient Information

1. **Primary Vitreoretinal Lymphoma** - Given the large, white, preretinal lesion and shifting subretinal fluid without a retinal break, this is highly suggestive.
2. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis** - Considered due to the extensive retinal involvement and high suspicion with retinal detachment in immunocompromised patients.
3. **Acute Retinal Necrosis** - Retinal detachment with vitreous cells and keratic precipitates can be seen in this condition.
4. **Toxoplasmosis Retinochoroiditis** - Diffuse retinal involvement with vitreous inflammation may suggest this, especially with the patient's age.
5. **Sarcoidosis** - granulomatous uveitis with retinal detachment can also point towards this diagnosis.
6. **Syphilitic Uveitis** - Can present with a variety of ocular inflammations including posterior uveitis and retinal detachment.
7. **Tuberculosis Uveitis** - Retinal and vitreous manifestations might suggest this in certain endemic regions or patient history.
8. **Behçet’s Disease** - Could be considered due to the retinal detachment and uveitis, less likely without systemic symptoms.
9. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Disease** - Less likely but possible in context with posterior uveitis and shifting subretinal fluid.
10. **Pars Planitis** - Although commonly seen in younger patients, the presence of vitreous cell and inferior snow banking makes it a differential.

A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain with and without gadolinium contrast was degraded by motion and orthodontic artifact but was suggestive of optic nerve enhancement consistent with optic neuritis. Results of serology tests and cerebral spinal fluid analysis were negative for infectious and inflammatory etiologies, including syphilis, sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, viral etiologies, multiple sclerosis, and lupus.

2. **Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO)** - Although more common with concurrent spinal cord involvement, it should still be considered given the optic neuritis-like presentation.
3. **Autoimmune Optic Neuropathy** - Even with negated typical causes, autoimmunity can still play a role and warrant further specific testing.
4. **Mitochondrial Optic Neuropathy** (including LHON) - Genetic testing could reveal mitochondrial involvement.
5. **Compressive Optic Neuropathy** - Despite negative MRI findings for mass, persistent and severe symptoms may require repeat imaging or other techniques to rule out compression.
6. **Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AION)** - Typically seen in older adults, but could be possible due to vascular causes.
7. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)** - Uncommon without severe headaches or other signs but should still be considered.

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old man presented with acute-onset weakness of his bilateral lower limbs for 3 days, accompanied by ascending numbness to just below his nipples. Three weeks prior, he had developed acute urinary retention. Neurological examination revealed weakness in bilateral lower limbs (Medical Research Council grade 4 on the right and grade 3 on the left), extensor plantar responses, and a sensory level at T6. Magnetic resonance imaging of his thoracic spine was performed 10 days after the onset of weakness and did not show any signal abnormalities or restricted diffusion. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis findings were remarkable for elevated protein (0.14 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]) but white cell count (5 cells/mm3) and glucose levels (54.05 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]) were normal. Cytology and flow cytometry were negative for malignancy. Antibodies to aquaporin 4 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein were not detected. The patient developed a sudden worsening of weakness in his legs 2 weeks after initial presentation. Repeated thoracic spine imaging showed an area of T2 hyperintensity in the left posterolateral cord at T7, which did not enhance with contrast or show restricted diffusion (Figure 1A). Notably, he had a 4-year history of an asymptomatic papular skin eruption with more lesions developing in the last 4 months. These were distributed on the neck, trunk, and limbs, sparing his face, scalp, and genitalia (Figure 1B). Findings of extensive workup for malignancy, including full-body computed tomography scan, paraneoplastic antibody panel, and systemic autoimmune diseases (antinuclear antibody, antidouble stranded DNA, and myositis antibody panel), were negative. The skin papules were biopsied.

### Reranking After Considering All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Neurosarcoidosis**
   - Justification: The patient's neurological deficits, imaging findings (T2 hyperintensity), negative germline for malignancy, and biopsy of skin lesions suggestive of granulomatous inflammation align well with neurosarcoidosis.

2. **Transverse Myelitis**
   - Justification: Classic presentation with bilateral limb weakness, sensory level, and transverse myelitis on imaging. However, the chronicity and associated skin lesions are less typical.

3. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**
   - Justification: Demyelinating disease with lesions in the CNS; however, the lack of aquaporin-4 Antibodies and timing with skin lesions is less characteristic.

4. **Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)**
   - Justification: Ascending weakness and albuminocytologic dissociation in CSF are typical, but the sensory level and imaging findings are atypical.

5. **Paraneoplastic Myelopathy**
   - Justification: Negative malignancy workup and lack of typical antibodies. 

6. **Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)**
   - Justification: Negative antibodies for aquaporin-4 and presentation not typical for NMOSD.

7. **Primary Central Nervous System (CNS) Lymphoma**
   - Justification: Imaging and CSF do not support lymphoma, and malignancy workup is negative.

8. **Subacute Combined Degeneration (Vitamin B12 Deficiency)**
   - Justification: Presents with neurological deficits but is less likely given the history and specific findings.

9. **Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)**
   - Justification: ADEM typically follows infections or vaccinations and affects a broader CNS area, less likely here.

10. **Spinal Cord Infarction**
   - Justification: Sensory level and acute presentation could match, but lack of vascular risk factors and imaging findings less typical.

    ",Cutaneous aspergillosis,"Let's develop a 10-step differential diagnosis for this patient step by step.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD):**
   - Given the chronic nature of nodules and involvement of skin and lungs, CGD is a consideration.

2. **Sarcoidosis:**
   - Granulomatous disease that can present with skin nodules and pulmonary involvement.

3. **Cutaneous Tuberculosis:**
   - Chronic nodular lesions on the skin and lung involvement could indicate mycobacterial infection.

4. **Chronic Actinic Dermatitis:**
   - Can cause skin changes in individuals with significant sun exposure, may present with nodules.

5. **Farmer’s Lung (Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis):**
   - Exposure to hay dust with respiratory symptoms points toward hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

6. **Aspiration Pneumonia:**
   - Mucus production and chronic respiratory symptoms can be related to recurrent aspiration.

7. **Fungal Infection (Aspergillosis):**
   - Brownish sputum with nodular lesions; Aspergillus species are common in people with chronic respiratory conditions and can form nodules.

8. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA):**
   - Proptosis, nodular skin lesions, and lung involvement can point to this vasculitis.

9. **Chronic Sinusitis:**
   - Potentially causing proptosis and chronic respiratory symptoms due to post-nasal drip.

10. **Nocardiosis:**
    - Chronic suppurative nodules and lung involvement are characteristic.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

After reviewing the information and test results (including histopathological and microbiological examinations):

1. **Fungal Infection (Aspergillosis):**
   - Confirmed by brownish sputum, nodular opacities on imaging, and nodule biopsy findings demonstrating fungal elements.
  
2. **Farmer’s Lung (Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis):**
   - Symptoms exacerbated by exposure to hay dust, chronic respiratory signs, and radiographic findings.

3. **Nocardiosis:**
   - Chronic nodules, pulmonary involvement, and environmental exposure are in favor of Nocardia species isolation.
  
4. **Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD):**
   - Chronic skin and lung infections/co-infections in an immunocompromised individual are possible.

5. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA):**
   - Proptosis, skin nodules, lung involvement align with GPA, but less likely if fungal infection confirmation is strong.

6. **Chronic Sinusitis:**
   - Associated with dental caries and respiratory symptoms, though less likely primary cause here.

7. **Cutaneous Tuberculosis:**
   - Possible with chronic skin nodules, but less likely if non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection rules out TB.

8. **Aspiration Pneumonia:**
   - Even though he has respiratory symptoms, the chronicity and nodule presentation reduce this likelihood.

9. **Chronic Actinic Dermatitis:**
   - Unlikely given the lack of other actinic changes and more suggestive histopathological results.

10. **Sarcoidosis:**
    - Less likely due to the presence of fungi in biopsy and lack of systemic sarcoidosis evidence.","['Dermatology', 'Fungal Infections', 'Infectious Diseases']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30.0,M

### INPUT:
A 69-year-old man presented with a 1-month history of progressive skin discoloration. His medical history included chronic kidney disease, chronic hepatitis C infection, cirrhosis, ischemic cardiomyopathy with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and atrial fibrillation with prophylactic apixaban. He had recurrent staphylococcus bacteremia due to infection of an ICD lead and had been treated for the past 6 months with minocycline, 100 mg twice daily. His arms had been purple and bruise-like for several years but turned a near black color 1 month ago. He reported no discoloration of his sweat or urine. He had no history of malnutrition and reported infrequent alcohol use. Physical examination showed dense blue-black skin pigmentation of his forearms, dorsal hands, legs, and dorsal feet, as well as blue discoloration of his sclerae and teeth (Figure 1). He had normal-colored nails and oral mucosa. Laboratory studies showed white blood cell count of 15 800/μL (reference range, 4000-11 000/μL), hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL (reference, 13.5-17.5 g/dL), platelet count of 58 000/μL (reference, 150 000-400 000/μL), and INR of 1.8 (reference, 0.8-1.1). Complete metabolic panel showed increased creatinine (1.51 mg/dL; reference, 0.64-1.27 mg/dL) and elevated total bilirubin (1.7 mg/dL; reference range, 0.3-1.2 mg/dL). His estimated glomerular filtration rate was 40 mL/min/1.73 m2.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation**: Given the long-term usage of minocycline, which is a known cause of hyperpigmentation.
2. **Chronic liver disease**: The patient has a known history of cirrhosis, often associated with skin changes.
3. **Chronic kidney disease-related pruritus and pigmentation**: Chronic kidney disease can lead to skin pigmentation changes.
4. **Porphyria cutanea tarda**: Given the liver disease and typical skin findings in sun-exposed areas.
5. **Amyloidosis**: Can cause blue-gray skin discoloration and is associated with chronic diseases.
6. **Argyria**: Chronic exposure to silver or silver-containing compounds can cause permanent skin discoloration.
7. **Hemochromatosis**: Iron overload condition, although less likely given the pattern of pigmentation.
8. **Addison's disease**: Hyperpigmentation due to increased ACTH, though less likely given the distribution of pigmentation.
9. **Melanoma with systemic involvement**: Skin discoloration due to metastatic melanoma, although no primary lesion is noted.
10. **Drug-induced pigmentation from amiodarone**: Although the patient is not currently known to be on amiodarone, but it's a potential cause of similar symptoms.

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old man presented with a 2-week history of a persistent blurred area in his right lower visual field of both eyes. He noticed colors surrounding the dark area that lasted 2 to 3 minutes at a time and occurred multiple times per day. His medical history was significant for dyslipidemia for which he took rosuvastatin. He also reported feeling lethargic, with polydipsia and a dull mild holocephalic headache during this period. Ophthalmological examination revealed a visual acuity of 20/20 OU, pupils were equal and reactive to light with no relative afferent pupillary defect, and color vision was normal. Dilated fundus examination was normal. Humphrey 24-2 Swedish interactive threshold algorithm fast visual field testing revealed a right homonymous hemianopia denser inferiorly (Figure, A). An urgent noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head was obtained and was normal (Figure, B). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was initially reported as normal but revealed subtle abnormal T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity involving the left occipital cortex after further review (Figure, B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Homonymous hemianopia secondary to nonketotic hyperglycemia,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Ischemic Stroke**  
Given the focal neurological deficits (right homonymous hemianopia), an ischemic stroke, especially affecting the left occipital lobe, is high on the differential diagnosis list.

2. **Intracranial Neoplasm**  
A brain tumor, specifically in the occipital cortex, could present similarly with visual field defects and subtle MRI changes.

3. **Multiple Sclerosis**  
Multiple sclerosis can present with T2 hyperintensities and visual field anomalies. The chronic and recurring nature of symptoms could point towards a demyelinating disease.

4. **Migrainous Visual Phenomena**
Migraine with aura could present with visual disturbances and headaches, although persistent visual field defects are less typical.

5. **Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)**
PRES might cause similar radiographic findings and visual disturbances, often in the context of blood pressure fluctuations, which could be related to dyslipidemia treatment.

6. **Metabolic Encephalopathy**
Conditions such as hyperglycemia could lead to visual disturbances and nonspecific MRI changes.

7. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**
Although less common, paraneoplastic neurological syndromes can present with visual disturbances and brain imaging changes.

8. **Vasculitis**
CNS vasculitis could lead to ischemic signs and subtle imaging findings, resulting in visual field deficits.

9. **Toxic or Medication-induced Encephalopathy**
Statins, like rosuvastatin, although rare, can sometimes cause central nervous system side effects, including visual disturbances and subtle MRI changes.

10. **Autoimmune Encephalitis**
Autoimmune processes affecting the brain can present with subtle MRI changes and visual field deficits.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Ischemic Stroke**  
The patient’s presentation (right homonymous hemianopia, subtle T2 hyperintensity in the left occipital cortex) strongly suggests an ischemic event affecting the occipital lobe.

2. **Intracranial Neoplasm**  
Given the visual deficits and abnormal MRI findings, a tumor remains a significant consideration.

3. **Vasculitis**  
CNS vasculitis could mimic stroke with localized ischemic changes on MRI.

4. **Migrainous Visual Phenomena**
While less likely due to persistent visual field defect, migraines can cause visual disturbances and associated MRI changes.

5. **Multiple Sclerosis**  
T2 hyperintensity and visual disturbances may indicate a demyelinating event, although persistent isolated visual field defects are less typical.

6. **Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)**
The MRI findings and visual disturbances could fit with PRES, especially given the underlying dyslipidemia treatment which can affect blood pressure.

7. **Autoimmune Encephalitis**
Subtle MRI changes and visual symptoms might also suggest an autoimmune process.

8. **Metabolic Encephalopathy**
Though less likely due to the specific MRI findings, metabolic issues related to blood sugar dysregulation could present similarly.

9. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**
This is a rare cause but still worth consideration given the atypical presentation and visual field findings.

10. **Toxic or Medication-induced Encephalopathy**
While very rare, it is still within the realm of possibility given his medication and the described symptoms.

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old woman was referred by optometry after waking up with cloudy vision in the left eye and an ache around the left brow. Visual acuity was 20/20 OD and light perception OS. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 15 mm Hg OD and 54 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination of the left eye was remarkable for a large cystic iris stromal lesion from the 2- to 7-o’clock position with iris-cornea touch. The anterior chamber was shallow in the area of the enlarged cystic lesion with a large amount of pigmented cells. The pupil was irregular with blood at the pupillary margin. Her intraocular lens was not visible because of occlusion by a cystic lesion behind the iris (Figure 1). Her ocular history was notable for indiscriminate trauma to her left eye, primary open-angle glaucoma in both eyes treated with dorzolamide hydrochloride and brimonidine tartrate, and pseudophakia in both eyes. Four years prior, an inferior cystic iris stromal lesion was discovered in the left eye that measured approximately 5 × 2 mm in basal dimensions at the slitlamp. Fine-needle aspiration was negative for malignancy, and the lesion was managed by close follow-up. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Secondary angle-closure glaucoma due to sudden enlargement of a cystic iris stromal lesion,"Sure, let's start with developing a differential diagnosis step by step for this patient, followed by a reranking based on all the available information and test results.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma (PACG):**
   - Given the patient's elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) of 54 mm Hg OS and a shallow anterior chamber, PACG is a strong consideration.

2. **Iris Cyst:**
   - The presence of a large cystic iris stromal lesion is highly indicative of an iris cyst. This correlates with her ocular history and current findings.

3. **Secondary Glaucoma:**
   - The elevated IOP and iris stromal lesion could indicate secondary glaucoma, specifically angle-closure due to the mass effect of the cyst.

4. **Uveitis-Glaucoma-Hyphaema (UGH) Syndrome:**
   - The iris cyst with pupillary margin blood and past history of trauma raise the possibility of UGH syndrome, especially if the intraocular lens is compromised or displaced.

5. **Intraocular Tumor:**
   - Though previous biopsy was negative, the current symptoms merit a reassessment for a benign or malignant intraocular tumor, given the lesion's growth and effects.

6. **Pseudophakic Malignant Glaucoma:**
   - The patient's pseudophakic status and elevated IOP could make pseudophakic malignant glaucoma a consideration.

7. **Neovascular Glaucoma:**
   - Blood at the pupillary margin and elevated IOP can also suggest neovascular glaucoma, secondary to possible ischemic ocular events or the iris cyst.

8. **Traumatic Glaucoma:**
   - The history of ocular trauma and current elevated IOP indicate a potential for traumatic glaucoma.

9. **Iris Nevus Syndrome (Cogan-Reese):**
   - Considering the lesion's characteristics, one must consider iris nevus syndrome, which often involves similar presentations but less mass effect.

10. **Iridocorneal Endothelial Syndrome (ICE):**
    - ICE syndrome should be on the list due to its association with anterior segment abnormalities and secondary glaucoma, although less likely given the context.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on Complete Information and Test Results

1. **Secondary Glaucoma (Angle-Closure):**
   - The combination of high IOP, cystic lesion causing physical obstruction, and previous benign biopsy makes this the foremost diagnosis.

2. **Iris Cyst:**
   - The patient's history and current findings strongly support the presence of an iris cyst affecting the eye's structure and function.

3. **Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma (PACG):**
   - The presentation of acute angle-closure, given the shallow anterior chamber due to the cyst, supports this strong contender.

4. **Traumatic Glaucoma:**
   - Considering the history of trauma, secondary complications leading to altered anatomy and increased IOP align well with this diagnosis.

5. **Uveitis-Glaucoma-Hyphaema (UGH) Syndrome:**
   - Given blood at the pupillary margin and potential lens compromise, UGH syndrome remains a significant possibility.

6. **Intraocular Tumor:**
   - An expanding intraocular lesion, while previously benign, necessitates revaluation for a potential misclassified tumor.

7. **Pseudophakic Malignant Glaucoma:**
   - Noting her pseudophakia and current IOP issue, this diagnosis stands relevant but less likely than others.

8. **Neovascular Glaucoma:**
   - Although possible due to blood presence, the cyst's mechanical effect better explains the presentation than new vessel growth.

9. **Iris Nevus Syndrome:**
   - Rare but still a contender given the pigmentation and lesion characteristics, though less likely due to less severe obstruction typically associated.

10. **Iridocorneal Endothelial Syndrome (ICE):**
    - Least likely but possible upon excluding more probable diagnoses, given secondary glaucoma factors.

### INPUT:
A 72-year-old woman presented with new-onset decreased vision in the right eye. Her ocular history included pseudoexfoliation syndrome and glaucomatous optic neuropathy in the right eye. Past ocular surgery included uncomplicated trabeculectomy in the right eye treated with mitomycin C (3 months prior) and no ocular surgery history in the left eye. Her medical history included pulmonary Mycobacterium avium infection secondary to hypogammaglobulinemia. Computed tomography scan 2 months prior exhibited reactivation and she started treatment with clarithromycin (1000 mg/d), ethambutol (15 mg/kg/d), and rifabutin (300 mg/d). Best-corrected visual acuity was hand motions OD and 20/20 OS. Intraocular pressures were 4 mm Hg ODand 13 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination of the right eye showed substantial conjunctival hyperemia and substantial cellular response in the anterior chamber (2 to 3+) along with a 1-mm hypopyon. There was no leak at the trabeculectomy bleb (negative Seidel test). B-scan ultrasonography showed no retinal detachment or mass. Presumed diagnosis of bleb-related infectious endophthalmitis was made and she was referred for treatment. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed, including vitreous sampling, and showed very light growth of Staphylococcus aureus in 1 colony on 1 plate, which was highly suspicious for contaminant. Intravitreal amikacin and vancomycin were administered after vitreous sampling was performed. Postoperatively, the patient initiated treatment with topical antibiotics and corticosteroids. Her visual acuity returned to 20/30. Two months later, she presented again with a similar acute vision loss in the left eye (counting fingers). Anterior segment examination showed conjunctival hyperemia, cellular reaction, and a small hypopyon (Figure). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Rifabutin-associated uveitis,"Let's develop a step-by-step differential diagnosis for the patient's presentation, considering her medical history, ocular history, and symptoms.

1. **Infectious Endophthalmitis**
   - Given her history of recent ocular surgery and the presence of anterior segment inflammation, infectious endophthalmitis must be considered.

2. **Drug-Induced Uveitis**
   - Considering her treatment with ethambutol and rifabutin, drug-induced uveitis should be evaluated as these medications can cause ocular inflammation.

3. **Reactivation of Mycobacterial Infection**
   - Given her pulmonary Mycobacterium avium infection and hypogammaglobulinemia, reactivation could also involve ocular components.

4. **Anterior Uveitis**
   - Primary anterior uveitis (not related to infection or drugs) could present with similar ocular findings.

5. **Autoimmune Uveitis**
   - Underlying autoimmune diseases such as sarcoidosis or lupus can cause uveitis.

6. **Herpetic Eye Disease**
   - Given the episodic nature of her symptoms, herpetic uveitis (either from HSV or VZV) should be considered, especially if there are corneal findings.

7. **Ocular Toxoplasmosis**
   - Toxoplasmosis can present with recurrent uveitis and hypopyon.

8. **Inflammatory Pseudophakic Endophthalmitis**
   - Although the patient did not receive intraocular lens implantation recently, certain types of intraocular surgeries can predispose to this condition.

9. **Metastatic Infection**
   - Systemic infections can metastasize to the eye, particularly under conditions like hypogammaglobulinemia.

10. **Masquerade Syndromes (e.g., intraocular lymphoma)**
   - Persistent, recurrent uveitis in an elderly patient should prompt evaluation for masquerade syndromes like intraocular lymphoma.

Now, let's rank these differentials based on the combined patient history, examination findings, and clinical course:

1. **Drug-Induced Uveitis**
2. **Reactivation of Mycobacterial Infection**
3. **Infectious Endophthalmitis**
4. **Anterior Uveitis**
5. **Autoimmune Uveitis**
6. **Herpetic Eye Disease**
7. **Ocular Toxoplasmosis**
8. **Inflammatory Pseudophakic Endophthalmitis**
9. **Masquerade Syndromes (e.g., intraocular lymphoma)**
10. **Metastatic Infection**

6. **Bacillary Angiomatosis**
7. **Pyogenic Granuloma**
8. **Lymphangioma**
9. **Peripheral Arterial Disease-Related Ulcers**
10. **Pigmented Basal Cell Carcinoma**

Now, let's re-rank them using all patient information and test results.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Kaposi Sarcoma** - Dark violaceous plaques are a classic presentation, even in the absence of HIV.
2. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans** - Considered due to the longstanding nature and nodularity of the lesion.
3. **Vascular Malformation (e.g., Hemangioma)** - Given the color and subcutaneous nature.
4. **Mycosis Fungoides (Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma)** - Long symptom duration and plaque characteristics.
5. **Lymphangioma** - Swelling and appearance fit, but less likely due to lack of historical presence since childhood.
6. **Melanoma** - Considered despite being asymptomatic and longstanding because of the darkening of plaques.
7. **Pigmented Basal Cell Carcinoma** - Could present similarly, though typically more superficial.
8. **Bacillary Angiomatosis** - Less likely given normal serology and patient's overall health.
9. **Pyogenic Granuloma** - Less likely due to asymptomatic and longstanding nature.
10. **Peripheral Arterial Disease-Related Ulcers** - Very unlikely given the patient’s normal metabolic panel and no history of atherosclerotic disease.

### INPUT:
A 57-year-old man with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) refractory to multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ie, imatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib) presented for subacute-onset blurry vision in both eyes. He had been admitted for an upcoming bone marrow transplant. The patient had floaters without flashes and denied any eye pain. A review of symptoms found chronic fatigue and a new, mild headache beginning a few days prior. On examination, his visual acuity was 20/50 OU; intraocular pressures were 15 mm Hg OD and 13 mm Hg OS; and pupils were equal, round, and reactive, without a relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular movements, confrontational visual fields, and Ishihara color plates were full. An anterior segment examination had normal results. A fundus examination revealed clinically significant peripapillary intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages obscuring the optic disc margins of both eyes (Figure 1). A peripheral retinal examination of both eyes had normal results. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Terson syndrome in a patient with CML with central nervous system involvement,"Given the patient's history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) refractory to multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors, presenting with subacute-onset blurry vision, floaters without flashes, new mild headache, and peripapillary intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages, a differential diagnosis process could be outlined as follows:

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)**: Given the intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages obscuring the optic disc margins, combined with the patient's age and symptoms.
  
2. **Leukemic Retinopathy**: Considering the patient has a history of CML, leukemic retinopathy can present with similar fundoscopic findings.

3. **Hypertensive Retinopathy**: Chronic hypertension can lead to retinal hemorrhages, particularly relevant in patients with systemic illnesses.

4. **Diabetic Retinopathy**: Although not mentioned, diabetes can cause similar retinal findings and should be ruled out if there's any history suggesting it.

5. **Valsalva Retinopathy**: Caused by acute rise in intraocular venous pressure, though there is no direct mention of Valsalva maneuver in the history.

6. **Optic Disc Drusen**: These can cause elevated optic discs and hemorrhages, though typically different in presentation.

7. **Papilledema**: Secondary to increased intracranial pressure, often presents with blurred disc margins and headache.

8. **Posterior Uveitis**: Can cause retinal hemorrhages but usually would present with more intraocular inflammation/irritation.

9. **Ocular Ischemic Syndrome**: Secondary to carotid artery insufficiency, leads to similar symptoms of visual disruption and retinal hemorrhages.

10. **Radiation Retinopathy**: If the patient had previous radiation therapy, it could account for the retinal hemorrhages seen.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis After Considering All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Leukemic Retinopathy**: Given the CML history and clinical presentation, this remains the highest suspicion.
2. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)**: High on the list due to the hemorrhages and visual symptoms.
3. **Papilledema**: The presence of headache increases the consideration for papilledema.
4. **Hypertensive Retinopathy**: Possible, especially with systemic disease consideration.
5. **Valsalva Retinopathy**: Less likely due to lack of Valsalva activity in the history but still considered.
6. **Ocular Ischemic Syndrome**: Given his systemic disease status, this remains relevant.
7. **Posterior Uveitis**: Less likely due to absence of significant inflammation signs.
8. **Optic Disc Drusen**: Less likely given the acute nature and the rest of the patient history.
9. **Radiation Retinopathy**: Unlikely without a direct history of radiation therapy but still considered.
10. **Diabetic Retinopathy**: Lower on the list without a firm diabetic history, based on initial information.

A 42-year-old woman was referred for ophthalmologic evaluation after developing blurry vision in the right eye 30 days prior. She had a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and migraine headaches. Her medications included atorvastatin, carvedilol, and norethindrone. Dilated-fundus examination of the right eye showed a single cotton-wool spot (indicating local retinal ischemia), with intraretinal hemorrhage in the inferotemporal quadrant. Ultrawide-field imaging showed a cotton-wool spot on the left fundus (Figure 1A, right) and a peripheral arterial occlusion in the right eye (Figure 1A, left), and fluorescein angiographic study of the right eye demonstrated an area of blockage corresponding to intraretinal hemorrhage and venous hyperfluorescence (Figure 1B). The patient was afebrile, with pulse 110 beats/min and blood pressure of 188/99 mm Hg. Auscultation over the heart apex revealed a holosystolic ejection murmur (grade 2/6). Laboratory testing showed normal complete blood cell count and thyrotropin level and negative results for autoantibodies against Sm, SSA, SSB, Scl-70, Jo-1, centromere, chromatin, ribonucleoprotein, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was mildly elevated (30 mm/h). Results of testing for antinuclear antibodies were positive at low titer (1:40, homogenous pattern) with positive dsDNA (5.0 IU/mL; negative if <4.0 IU/mL). Blood cultures were negative for bacterial or fungal growth after 5 days. An echocardiogram revealed pedunculated and mobile aortic valve vegetations.

9. **Toxic Retinopathy (medication-induced)**
10. **Multiple Sclerosis (less likely)**

Now, let’s rerank the differential diagnosis based on the patient's information and test results:
1. **Infective Endocarditis** - Given the echocardiogram finding of mobile aortic valve vegetations together with the retinal signs and cardiac findings, this is highly likely.
2. **Hypertensive Retinopathy** - With blood pressure significantly elevated (188/99 mm Hg) and history of hypertension, hypertensive retinopathy is plausible.
3. **Lupus Retinopathy** - Positive antinuclear antibodies and dsDNA suggest autoimmune involvement which raises the likelihood.
4. **Branch Retinal Artery Occlusion** - Peripheral arterial occlusion in the right eye seen on imaging supports this as differential.
5. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion** - The intraretinal hemorrhage and venous hyperfluorescence noted on angiography align with this.
6. **Giant Cell Arteritis** - Given elevated ESR, although the demographic and other presenting symptoms make it less likely compared to higher ranked differentials.
7. **Hypercoagulable State (Antiphospholipid Syndrome)** - Positive dsDNA raises suspicion for lupus-related hypercoagulable conditions.
8. **Diabetic Retinopathy** - No history of diabetes, this is less likely but still considered as part of the wider differential.
9. **Toxic Retinopathy** - Medication history could potentially contribute although less likely given the findings.
10. **Multiple Sclerosis** - Ophthalmologic manifestations like optic neuritis can occur, but unlikely given the rest of the clinical picture.

The rankings are based on matching the clinical picture, which highly supports both Infective Endocarditis and Hypertensive Retinopathy, followed by autoimmune-related conditions given the laboratory findings.","['Coagulation Disorders', 'Hematology', 'Valvular Heart Disease', 'Cardiology', 'Ophthalmology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,42.0,F

### INPUT:
A 68-year-old man presented to the clinic with bilateral eye redness and pain for the past 6 months. He had a history of dry eye disease for which he was treated with preservative-free artificial tears. He also noted a medical history of well-controlled HIV with highly active antiretroviral therapy. His last CD 4 lymphocyte count was 750 cells/mm3 with an undetectable viral load. A review of system produced negative results, including absence of weight loss, fevers, headache, joint pain, respiratory symptoms, or skin rash. The patient reported having unprotected sexual contact with multiple male partners in the past few years. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination demonstrated diffuse scleral injection in both eyes without any scleral thinning. The redness did not blanch after administration of phenylephrine, 10% (Figure 1). Both eyes appeared to be moderately tender to touch. The rest of the anterior segment examination was within normal limits without any evidence of intraocular inflammation. Dilated fundus examination was also unremarkable in both eyes. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Bilateral syphilitic scleritis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Chronic Scleritis**: Given the pain and redness not responding to phenylephrine, and the diffuse scleral injection without thinning.
   
2. **Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (Severe Dry Eye Disease)**: History of dry eye disease and possible severe manifestation compound symptoms.
   
3. **Ocular Syphilis**: Unprotected sexual contact with multiple male partners and the chronic nature of symptoms necessitating investigation for syphilis.
   
4. **Herpes Simplex Keratitis**: Chronic HIV infection can predispose patients to viral reactivations affecting the eye.
   
5. **Sarcoidosis**: Chronic bilateral eye symptoms and the systemic inflammatory nature can affect ocular structures.
   
6. **Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA)**: An older adult presenting with chronic eye pain and redness; though systemic symptoms are absent, ocular manifestation can sometimes precede.
   
7. **Uveitis**: Unremarkable intraocular findings suggest that anterior uveitis might be missed; however, it typically shows some indication in exams.
   
8. **Tuberculosis-related Scleritis**: Given potential exposure risks, TB should be considered for persistent eye inflammation.
   
9. **Peripheral Ulcerative Keratitis**: Consider for chronic ocular symptoms without a clear marked intraocular inflammation.
   
10. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: Chronic systemic inflammatory diseases can present primarily with ocular symptoms.

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information

1. **Chronic Scleritis**: Most aligned with the symptoms of chronic bilateral pain, redness not blanching with phenylephrine, and moderate tenderness.
   
2. **Ocular Syphilis**: High-risk sexual behavior places him at risk, making this a significant differential despite the absence of systemic symptoms.
   
3. **Herpes Simplex Keratitis**: HIV and chronic symptoms need strong consideration but often show more distinct corneal involvement.
   
4. **Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca**: Chronic dry eye might exacerbate into significant redness and pain, though less commonly this severely.
   
5. **Sarcoidosis**: Chronic inflammatory condition fits well but typically shows more broader systemic involvement.
   
6. **Tuberculosis-related Scleritis**: Given geographic and exposure risks associated with TB, consider persistent ocular issues.
   
7. **Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA)**: Even without systemic aspects, GCA’s ocular manifestations in older adults warrant consideration but less likely without additional symptoms.
   
8. **Uveitis**: Typically, uveitis would show some evidence on examination, making this less likely.
   
9. **Peripheral Ulcerative Keratitis**: Unlikely given the limited evidence of corneal erosion or distinct ulcerative conditions.
   
10. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: Fits the chronic inflammatory profile but lower on the list due to absence of broader systemic symptoms.

The diagnosis process should now follow targeted investigations, likely beginning with serologic tests for syphilis, additional imaging (B-scan ultrasonography), and possible referral to a rheumatologist to confirm or rule out the stated diseases.","['External Eye Disease', 'HIV', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Ophthalmology', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,68.0,M

### INPUT:
A woman in her 50s with a history of nasal-type natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (diagnosed 2 years prior; treated with pembrolizumab and methotrexate, ifosfamide, etoposide, dexamethasone, and pegaspargase) and chronic pulmonary coccidiomycosis being treated with fluconazole was admitted for fever, hypotension, and rash. Three months prior, pembrolizumab treatment was stopped because of a widespread morbilliform reaction, which had resolved completely 6 to 8 weeks before admission. The new widespread, asymptomatic skin eruption had been ongoing for 1 to 2 weeks and appeared different from her pembrolizumab reaction. A complete blood cell count was notable for a normal white blood cell count of 4100/μL, normal absolute neutrophil count of 2940/μL, chronic normocytic anemia (hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL), and chronic thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 62 ×103/μL). Blood culture results showed no growth at 1 week. Serum β-D-glucan, galactomannan, Coccidioides antibody by complement fixation, and immunodiffusion results were negative. Respiratory viral panel and SARS-CoV-2 test results were negative. Total body skin examination findings were notable for widespread, nontender, erythematous patches and thin plaques, some with prominent overlying telangiectases and hyperpigmentation (Figure, A). A punch biopsy of a representative lesion was performed (Figure, B-D). 
### OUTPUT:

**Step 7:** Autoimmune rash

**Step 8:** Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma

**Step 9:** Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)

**Step 10:** Vasculitis

**Reranked Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma** - Given her history of nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphoma and the characteristics of the skin lesions, this is a strong possibility.
  
2. **Drug reaction** - Although pembrolizumab was stopped and the previous reaction resolved, a delayed drug reaction or a reaction to fluconazole could still be considered.
  
3. **Malignancy recurrence** - The patient's history of lymphoma raises the concern for recurrence or secondary malignancy.

4. **Autoimmune rash** - Given the recurrent nature and morphology of the lesions, an autoimmune etiology is possible.

5. **Paraneoplastic syndrome** - Often associated with underlying malignancies and can present with diverse skin manifestations.

6. **Secondary infection** - Despite negative cultures and serum tests, some infections might still not be excluded completely.

7. **Fungal infection** - Chronic pulmonary coccidiomycosis is being treated, but disseminated fungal infection should be ruled out.

8. **Viral exanthem** - Negative for respiratory viruses and SARS-CoV-2, but other viruses might still be relevant.

9. **Vasculitis** - Could present with erythematous patches and plaques, though less likely without supportive lab findings.

10. **GVHD** - Unlikely given no history of transplantation, but it is placed here for completeness.","['Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Lymphomas', 'Skin Lymphomas']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,50.0,F

### INPUT:
A 59-year-old man presented with progressive hoarseness and dyspnea over a 2-month period. Fifteen months previously, he had undergone allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) with a matched related donor for treatment of fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3) internal tandem duplication–mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The patient had been diagnosed with chronic gastrointestinal graft-vs-host disease after a workup for diarrhea. Results of a restaging bone marrow biopsy 2 weeks prior to presentation showed no evidence of leukemia. Physical examination findings revealed no neck masses or abnormalities, but the patient was noted to be severely dysphonic and stridulous. Flexible laryngoscopy findings demonstrated a right vocal fold neoplasm crossing the posterior commissure with associated bilateral vocal fold motion impairment and obstruction of the glottic airway (Figure, A). Awake tracheostomy was performed for airway protection, and biopsy of the neoplasm was obtained via operative microlaryngoscopy (Figure, B). Histologic findings demonstrated diffuse infiltrate of large cells with irregular nuclear contours, vesicular chromatin, and prominent nucleoli (Figure, C). Immunohistochemical stains showed CD33, CD43, and CD117 positivity, with a subset positive for CD7 and myeloperoxidase. Stains were negative for CD3, CD20, and cytokeratin expression. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Extramedullary myeloid sarcoma of the larynx,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Laryngeal Cancer** – Progressive hoarseness and dyspnea with a neoplasm obstructing the glottic airway.
2. **Recurrent AML** – The history of FLT3-mutated AML may suggest recurrence in an unusual site.
3. **Graft-vs-Host Disease (GvHD) of the Larynx** – Given the history of chronic GvHD, involvement might be an unusual manifestation.
4. **Lymphoma** – Large cells with irregular nuclear contours; involvement of extranodal sites.
5. **Infectious Laryngitis** – Immunocompromised patient post-allo-SCT; potential for fungal or viral infection.
6. **Kaposi Sarcoma** – Immunocompromised post-transplant can have atypical Kaposi sarcoma involving the larynx.
7. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** – Common malignancy in the larynx, secondary possibility.
8. **Metastatic Disease** – Unusual site but possible metastasis to larynx.
9. **Sarcoma** – Histologic appearance of large cells might suggest sarcomatous changes.
10. **Plasmacytoma** – Immunocompromised patient; plasma cell neoplasm with possible atypical presentation.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Lymphoma** – Histological findings of large cells with CD33, CD43, CD117 positivity with a subset positive for CD7 and myeloperoxidase match more closely with hematologic malignancy.
2. **Recurrent AML** – Considering the immunohistochemical staining characteristics and history of AML.
3. **Graft-vs-Host Disease (GvHD) of the Larynx** – Uncommon, but history and symptoms align.
4. **Sarcoma** – Histology consistent with large irregular cells, although less likely without further characteristic markers.
5. **Laryngeal Cancer** – Malignant neoplasm is a common cause of voice changes and airway obstruction.
6. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** – Typical laryngeal malignancy, but contradicts the presented histologic findings.
7. **Metastatic Disease** – Potential but less likely without primary source information.
8. **Kaposi Sarcoma** – Less likely without characteristic histology and immunochemistry.
9. **Plasmacytoma** – Possible given post-transplant immunocompromised status but immunohistochemical staining is not characteristic.
10. **Infectious Laryngitis** – Unlikely due to histologic findings; should have signs of infection on biopsy.","['Laryngology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematology', 'Oncology']",0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,59.0,M

A 40-year-old man presented with a large left neck mass in the setting of recently treated mixed nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) of the right testicle with metastasis to the retroperitoneal and mediastinal lymph nodes. He was treated with a right radical orchiectomy and 4 cycles of etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (VIP) chemotherapy with resulting reduction in metastatic tumor burden and normalization of α-fetoprotein and β-human chorionic gonadotropin. The patient’s neck swelling, which initially decreased in size while undergoing chemotherapy, progressively enlarged shortly after concluding treatment. He underwent magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography of the neck that showed a clearly defined, bulky supraclavicular mass confined to left neck levels 3, 4, and 5 (Figure).

1. **Metastatic recurrence of mixed nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT)**
2. **Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma** (still considering the patient’s cancer history and possible secondary malignancy)
3. **Lymphoma** (secondary lymphoid malignancy)
4. **Thyroid carcinoma** (less likely but possible due to anatomical proximity)

A 14-year-old boy was referred to us because of ocular and periocular pain with photophobia in his right eye for the last 5 days. Aside from atopic dermatitis, his medical history was unremarkable. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Slitlamp examination of the right eye disclosed conjunctival hyperemia and ciliary congestion, anterior chamber flare 2+, and a few nongranulomatous keratic precipitates; the left anterior segment was quiet. Intraocular pressure was 15 mm Hg OU. Pupillary light responses were normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed 1+ of vitritis (binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy score) in the right eye and swelling of the optic disc in both eyes, to a greater extent in the right eye (Figure, A). Routine blood tests, including full blood cell count, plasma glucose levels, liver function test, and kidney function test, were performed on the same day and showed a serum creatinine level of 1.57 mg/dL (reference range: 0.5-1.0 mg/dL; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4). Antibodies anti–Treponema pallidum were tested and the results were negative. 
### OUTPUT:

1. **Acute Anterior Uveitis** (due to the presence of anterior chamber flare and keratic precipitates)
2. **Optic Neuritis** (due to swelling of the optic disc and unilateral photophobia)
3. **Sarcoidosis** (considering systemic association with optic nerve involvement and uveitis)
4. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease** (multisystem disorder that can present with bilateral optic disc swelling)
5. **Tubulointerstitial Nephritis and Uveitis (TINU) syndrome** (because of elevated serum creatinine level and uveitis)
6. **Infectious Endophthalmitis** (should be considered given vitritis and acute onset)
7. **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis** (in a young patient with ocular pain and photophobia)
8. **Leber's optic neuropathy** (hereditary optic neuropathy that can rapidly affect both eyes)
9. **Multiple sclerosis** (due to optic neuritis association)
10. **Behçet's disease** (due to systemic inflammatory disease with uveitis)

### Reranked List Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Tubulointerstitial Nephritis and Uveitis (TINU) syndrome** (elevated serum creatinine level strongly supports this)
2. **Acute Anterior Uveitis** (consistent with clinical eye examination findings)
3. **Optic Neuritis** (optic disc swelling and photophobia)
4. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease** (bilateral optic disc swelling consideration)
5. **Sarcoidosis** (systemic involvement with uveitis)
6. **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis** (age-related consideration)
7. **Multiple sclerosis** (optic neuritis association)
8. **Infectious Endophthalmitis** (rapid onset with vitritis)
9. **Behçet's disease** (systemic inflammatory disease relevance with uveitis)

### INPUT:
A woman in her mid-60s, who was in remission following successful combination chemotherapy for Burkitt lymphoma 8 years previously, presented with dyspnea, fatigue, general malaise, and presyncope. On examination, she was normotensive, afebrile, and clinically euvolemic. Laboratory testing showed a hemoglobin level of 12.1 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10), white blood cell count of 9900/µL (to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001), erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 76 mm/h, lactate dehydrogenase level of 139 U/L (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167), and normal coagulation profile. Serum immunoglobulin quantitation showed normal immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgA, and IgM levels of 1590 mg/L, 303 mg/L, and 94 mg/L, respectively (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 0.01). Blood culture findings were negative. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography (Figure 1 and Video) showed a large echogenic mass on the inferior aspect of the interatrial septum with infiltration of the coronary sinus, anterior mitral valve annulus, and aortic root. The mass protruded into the left ventricular outflow tract without causing valve obstruction. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a bilobed interatrial mass measuring 5.6 × 3.1 × 3.8 cm with patchy late gadolinium enhancement of the lesion. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a left hilar mass encasing the left upper lobe bronchus with extension into the left main pulmonary artery, a nodular soft tissue lesion along the anterior nasal septum, and no abdominal or pelvic disease. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a left paraclinoid mass lesion consistent with a meningioma and right Meckel cave lesions.

Step 10: Lymphoid hyperplasia of the nasal septum

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Metastatic recurrence of Burkitt lymphoma**: Given the patient's history and the presence of multiple masses in different locations, the recurrence of Burkitt lymphoma is plausible.
2. **Lung cancer with cardiac metastases**: The large echogenic cardiac mass, combined with the left hilar mass encasing the bronchus, suggests a primary lung malignancy with metastases to the heart.
3. **Primary cardiac sarcoma**: A rare but possible primary tumor given the cardiac mass and involvement of the mitral valve annulus and aortic root.
4. **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis**: Systemic disease that could present with multiple lesions, including the cardiac and pulmonary findings.
5. **Meningioma with extracranial metastases**: Although rare, meningiomas can metastasize, and multiple cranial and extracranial masses suggest this possibility.
6. **Cardiac myxoma**: The location and presentation could align with this diagnosis, although other findings make metastatic disease more likely.
7. **Amyloidosis**: Multi-organ involvement with masses could suggest amyloidosis, though less common in this pattern.
8. **Sarcoidosis**: Could explain multiple organ involvement; however, the specific lesion characteristics seen here are less typical.
9. **Lymphoid hyperplasia of the nasal septum**: The isolated nasal lesion could hint at lymphoid hyperplasia, but other systemic findings are less compatible.

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old woman, with dyslipidemia, presented to the emergency department with sudden vision loss in the right eye. Visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/20 OS. Anterior segment, tonometry, and pupillary light reflex were unremarkable. Ophthalmoscopy of the right eye showed discretely blurred optic disc margins, tortuous and dilated retinal veins, and intraretinal hemorrhages in all quadrants; the left eye was unremarkable. An optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan showed a cystoid macular edema (CME) in the right eye; the left was unremarkable. Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was 133 μm OD and 82 μm OS (reference value, 95.4 ± 10.48 μm).1 A fluorescein angiography was scheduled. One week later, the patient returned to our department due to multiple episodes of amaurosis fugax in left eye. By that time, ophthalmoscopy disclosed a mild optic disc swelling, tortuous venous vessels, and retinal hemorrhages bilaterally (Figure 1). The OCT scan showed a CME spontaneous resolution in the right eye while the left eye was unremarkable. Fluorescein angiography revealed a slight delay in venous filling but no capillary nonperfusion areas. These features were compatible with bilateral nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), with spontaneous reperfusion in the right eye. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Occult tumor presenting with bilateral CRVO,"### Initial 10-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)**
2. **Diabetic Retinopathy**
3. **Hypertensive Retinopathy**
4. **Optic Neuritis**
5. **Giant Cell Arteritis**
6. **Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO)**
7. **Ocular Ischemic Syndrome**
8. **Retinal Artery Occlusion**
9. **Amaurosis Fugax secondary to Carotid Artery Stenosis**
10. **Retinal Vasculitis**

### Re-Evaluated and Prioritized Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO):** The primary findings such as intraretinal hemorrhages, tortuous and dilated veins, and macular edema are classic for CRVO.
  
2. **Amaurosis Fugax secondary to Carotid Artery Stenosis:** Given the patient's episodes of transient vision loss in the left eye, carotid artery stenosis is a significant differential to consider.

3. **Hypertensive Retinopathy:** The presence of tortuous veins and hemorrhages can be consistent with changes seen in hypertensive retinopathy, especially overlapping with patient’s dyslipidemia.

4. **Ocular Ischemic Syndrome:** Symptoms like retinal hemorrhages and transient vision loss could point towards ocular ischemic syndrome, especially with a delay in venous filling seen in fluorescein angiography.

5. **Diabetic Retinopathy:** Even though our patient hasn't been diagnosed with diabetes, dyslipidemia can often co-exist with diabetes, warranting consideration of early diabetic retinopathy changes.

6. **Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO):** Although features seem widespread, BRVO might present similarly but generally would be more focal than diffuse changes seen here.

7. **Retinal Vasculitis:** While less likely in this case, retinal vasculitis can present with similar ocular findings, especially with a bilateral presentation.

8. **Giant Cell Arteritis:** Despite being less typical here due to age and presentation, GCA can cause similar optic nerve changes and needs ruling out in sudden vision changes.

9. **Retinal Artery Occlusion:** Although primary findings suggest venous involvement, any delay or obstruction in blood flow should consider this differential.

10. **Optic Neuritis:** Less likely due to the absence of pain and typical demyelination signs, but inflammation of the optic nerve can present with disc swelling and visual acuity changes.

### Conclusion:
Bilateral nonischemic CRVO, possibly driven by systemic vascular risk factors (e.g., dyslipidemia), remains the leading diagnosis. Concurrent vascular events like amaurosis fugax necessitate evaluation for carotid artery stenosis or other ischemic conditions.","['Coagulation Disorders', 'Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Retinal Disorders', 'Ophthalmology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,47.0,F

### INPUT:
A 13-year-old male presented to the pediatric otolaryngology clinic with a 2-year history of a right neck mass that had slowly increased in size. He denied any associated symptoms of pain, fevers, chills, malaise, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, prior history of neck masses, recent upper respiratory tract infections, or skin lesions. He was the product of a full-term pregnancy with up-to-date immunizations. Physical examination revealed a 2.5-cm firm, ovoid, mobile, and nontender mass at the apex of the posterior triangle of the right neck without any associated overlying skin changes. The remainder of the head and neck examination was unremarkable. Doppler ultrasonography revealed a 1.9 × 1.8 × 0.9-cm hypoechoic mass, and subsequent fine-needle aspirates demonstrated cells with elongated nuclei and eccentric blue cytoplasm in a background of myxoid stroma. The mass was excised in entirety without issue. At the time of surgery, the deep surface of the mass was found to be adherent to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The lesion was resected with a cuff of muscle and sent for permanent histopathological examination. This revealed proliferation of bland spindle cells with plump nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged as loose fascicles in a background of myxoid stroma (Figure 1). These cells were positive for mucin 4 (MUC4), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and transducing-like enhancer of split 1 (TLE1) immunohistochemical stains. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed a positive FUS (16p11) gene rearrangement.

1. **Nodular Fasciitis**: Given the histopathological and immunohistochemical features (MUC4, EMA, TLE1 positivity) and the FUS gene rearrangement, Nodular Fasciitis is a strong contender.
2. **Desmoid Tumor**: This could present similarly but less likely given the MUC4 and TLE1 positivity.
3. **Myxoid Liposarcoma**: The myxoid stroma and spindle cells align with this diagnosis, but the age and location make it less likely.
4. **Schwannoma**: This could have a similar appearance but is less likely due to the specific histopathological findings.
5. **Pediatric Fibrosarcoma**: The spindle cells in a myxoid background align, but it’s less likely given the benign nature of the cells.
6. **Fibromatosis**: Shares some histological features but less likely due to the immunohistochemical profile.
7. **Solitary Fibrous Tumor**: Could present similar histologic features but typically does not show FUS rearrangement.
8. **Neurofibroma**: While this could present similarly, the immunohistochemical findings and FUS rearrangement make it less likely.
9. **Hemangioma**: Typically would have a more vascular appearance on imaging and histology.
10. **Lipoma**: Generally consists of mature fat cells, which do not correlate with the current histopathological findings.

### INPUT:
A 45-year-old woman was referred to the medical retina service for evaluation of bilateral macular atrophy noted by her general ophthalmologist. Medical history was positive for bilateral sensorineural hearing loss with cochlear origin as determined by an otolaryngologist and headache since age 35 years. She had no history of longer-term use of medications. There was no family history of hearing and vision loss in all immediate family members. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/63 OS. Her pupils were round and reactive. The anterior segment was unremarkable. Fundus examination confirmed the presence of bilateral macular atrophy. Fundus autofluorescence revealed a fairly symmetric loss of autofluorescence in the macula and in the regions surrounding the optic disc (Figure). In proximity of these areas of reduced autofluorescence, a speckled fundus autofluorescence pattern of alternating spots of increased and decreased autofluorescence was also noted. Optical coherence tomography displayed the presence of a bilateral atrophy of the outer retina and retinal pigment epithelium (Figure). The patient’s family underwent a complete ophthalmologic evaluation, which did not display any alteration. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and strokelike episodes–related syndrome,"Given the clinical presentation of bilateral macular atrophy, sensorineural hearing loss, and consistent ophthalmologic findings, here is the differential diagnosis list, considering one potential diagnosis per step.

### Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps

1. **Usher Syndrome**: Given the combination of hearing loss and retinal degeneration.

2. **Stargardt Disease**: Macular atrophy with speckled fundus autofluorescence can be consistent with this inherited retinal dystrophy, though lacks hearing loss association.

3. **Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis (LCA)**: Early onset retinal dystrophy typically with severe visual impairment; can have sensorineural hearing loss as a part of syndromic forms but less likely at patient's age onset.

4. **Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP)**: Progressive retinal degeneration, though typically involves peripheral vision initially. Syndromic forms can include hearing loss.

5. **Choroideremia**: X-linked condition causing retinal degeneration but usually has choroidal atrophy, though it typically affects males more often.

6. **Adult-onset Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy (AVMD)**: Often presents with bilateral macular changes, but not typically associated with hearing loss.

7. **Cone-Rod Dystrophy**: Presents with macular atrophy and can present with variable vision loss but is typically sporadic.

8. **Central Areolar Choroidal Dystrophy (CACD)**: Progressive retinal atrophy and decreased central vision.

9. **Batten Disease**: Neurodegenerative disorder; juvenile forms could present with vision and hearing loss.

10. **Maternally Inherited Diabetes and Deafness (MIDD)**: Mitochondrial disorder involving hearing loss, diabetes, and potential retinal changes.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

Taking into account all the patient information and the findings (bilateral macular atrophy, specific autofluorescence patterns, sensorineural hearing loss, lack of family history), here's the refined differential diagnosis ranking:

1. **Usher Syndrome**
2. **Retinitis Pigmentosa (Syndromic Form)**
3. **Stargardt Disease**
4. **Cone-Rod Dystrophy**
5. **Maternally Inherited Diabetes and Deafness (MIDD)**
6. **Adult-onset Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy (AVMD)**
7. **Central Areolar Choroidal Dystrophy (CACD)**
8. **Choroideremia**
9. **Batten Disease**
10. **Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis (LCA)**

Usher Syndrome ranks highest due to the combination of retinal degeneration and sensorineural hearing loss typically associated with this genetic disorder, while the others are considered less likely but still pertinent to investigate further.","['Dermatology', 'Pediatrics', 'Otolaryngology', 'Audiology and Hearing', 'Retinal Disorders']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,45.0,F

### INPUT:
A school-aged boy experienced generalized erythematous rashes for 4 years. Skin examination showed ichthyosiform brownish plaques on his lower extremities and multiple erythematous confluent papules and plaques on his trunk and face (Figure, A and B). Topical steroid and pimecrolimus were administered, but their effects were limited. In addition, painful distal and proximal interphalangeal joints were noted for 2 years, and the patient could not clench his fists. Uveitis in both eyes was also diagnosed by an ophthalmologist. Microscopic examination of his hair showed no trichorrhexis invaginata or trichorrhexis nodosa. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained and submitted for further histopathologic analysis (Figure, C and D).

9. **Seborrheic Dermatitis**
10. **Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL)**

### Re-Evaluated Diagnosis Based on Patient Information and Test Results

#### Most likely diagnosis given patient history, symptoms, and examinations:

1. **Psoriasis**: The combination of ichthyosiform plaques, erythematous papules, plaques on the trunk and face, joint pain, and uveitis strongly suggests psoriasis, especially psoriatic arthritis.
2. **Dermatomyositis**: This could present with skin changes and joint pain but typically involves muscle weakness. Painful joints and ichthyosiform plaques are less typical.
3. **Ichthyosis Vulgaris**: The ichthyosiform plaques fit, but this usually does not involve joint pain or uveitis.
4. **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)**: Joint pain and uveitis fit well, but typical skin findings do not include ichthyosiform plaques or the described rashes.
5. **Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL)**: Could present with persistent plaques and has systemic manifestations but is less likely given the uveitis and joint implications.
6. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: Could involve joint pain, skin rash, and uveitis, but skin involvement is typically different from ichthyosiform plaques.
7. **Atopic Dermatitis**: Chronic skin changes and plaques are possible, but it's less likely with the unresponsive nature to treatments and additional systemic symptoms.
8. **Sarcoidosis**: This can cause skin, joint, and eye involvement, but usually has characteristic granulomas on biopsy.
9. **Lichen Planus**: Presents with papules and plaques but less typical features such as ichthyosiform plaques and uveitis.
10. **Seborrheic Dermatitis**: Less severe condition often localized to oily regions, not consistent with the patient's severe and prolonged symptoms.","['Dermatology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Rheumatology', 'Pediatrics']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,-1.0,M

### INPUT:
A 70-year-old woman with an ocular history of primary open-angle glaucoma on latanoprost, bilateral trabeculectomies, and argon laser trabeculoplasties presented with several months of worsening vision in the left eye. On examination, her best-corrected distance visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/60 OS (baseline 20/40 OU). Pupils were equally round and reactive, without afferent pupillary defect. Findings of Amsler grid testing were notable for a small area of distortion inferiorly in the left eye. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were 13 mm Hg in both eyes. Findings of anterior segment examination were unremarkable. Findings of dilated fundus examination were notable for cup-disc ratio of 0.9 in the right eye and 0.85 in the left eye with temporal thinning, stable from prior, and new intraretinal thickening in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the left eye revealed schiticlike separation of the outer plexiform and outer nuclear layers extending from the temporal edge of the optic nerve head to the fovea (Figure 1A), continuous with the peripapillary nerve sheath. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Macular retinoschisis in the setting of glaucomatous optic atrophy,"Let's develop a 10-step differential diagnosis and then rerank these considering all patient information and test results. 

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Macular Edema**: The presence of intraretinal thickening and changes in OCT suggest a swelling of the macula.
2. **Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy**: Given the schitic-like separation observed in OCT imaging, this could be a consideration.
3. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR)**: Fluid accumulation and specific OCT findings could point towards CSCR.
4. **Epiretinal Membrane (ERM)**: Distortion and thickening suggest the presence of ERM.
5. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**: Worsening vision and findings on Amsler grid are common in AMD.
6. **Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)**: While there's no mention of diabetes, DME should be included as a possibility.
7. **Macular Hole**: Could explain the evidence of schisis and other changes on OCT.
8. **Retinal Vein Occlusion**: Can lead to changes in retina structure including intraretinal thickening.
9. **Uveitic Macular Edema**: Although no inflammation noted, it can cause similar OCT findings.
10. **Myopic Maculopathy**: Relevant if the patient has a high degree of myopia, given the structural changes seen in OCT.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Macular Edema**: Primary hypothesis given the intraretinal thickening and schitic-like separation in OCT.
2. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**: Supported by patient's age and visual changes; retinal changes on Amsler.
3. **Epiretinal Membrane (ERM)**: Distortion and thickening are classic signs; very plausible given OCT findings.
4. **Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy**: The OCT findings are somewhat suggestive; but this is less common in older adults.
5. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR)**: OCT finding compatible but less likely in elderly women.
6. **Retinal Vein Occlusion**: Needs to be considered due to intraretinal thickening.
7. **Macular Hole**: OCT findings partially support this, though less definitive without further details.
8. **Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)**: Given no evidence or history of diabetes, less likely but still a differential.
9. **Uveitic Macular Edema**: The absence of inflammation makes this less likely.
10. **Myopic Maculopathy**: Less likely without explicit mention of myopia but possible given structural changes.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 20s with a history of daily soft contact lens (CL) wear was referred by her local ophthalmologist for a recalcitrant central corneal ulcer in her left eye. She had no history of eye trauma, did not sleep in her CLs, and stopped using CLs at symptom onset. Of note, she had recently been swimming in a freshwater lake prior to the onset of the ulcer. She was initially treated with topical besifloxacin and followed up daily. She appeared to improve clinically with resolution of her epithelial defect after 3 days, and topical loteprednol was added. Results of initial corneal cultures were negative. One week later, she presented with worsening pain and vision, which prompted referral to our cornea clinic where, 2 weeks after her initial presentation, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/150 OS. Left-eye examination demonstrated diffuse microcystic corneal edema and stromal thickening with no Descemet membrane folds (Figure 1A). A 2 × 2-mm stromal opacity was noted paracentrally with no epithelial defects. The anterior chamber demonstrated 1+ cell. Intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg OS. Corneal cultures for bacteria, fungi, and acanthamoeba were repeated, and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) was performed on the stromal infiltrate (Figure 1B). After reviewing the IVCM images, what empirical treatment would you recommend while awaiting the results of the repeated corneal cultures? 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Purpureocillium lilacinum keratitis confirmed by culture growth 21 days later,"To systematically consider possible differential diagnoses and determine the most appropriate empirical treatment, we begin with a list of potential causes of a corneal ulcer in a contact lens wearer who has recently been exposed to water. Here are the 10 differential diagnoses, each with a brief explanation:

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Acanthamoeba keratitis**
   - A notable cause of corneal infection in contact lens wearers with water exposure.
  
2. **Bacterial keratitis**
   - Common in contact lens users; typical pathogens include Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

3. **Fungal keratitis**
   - Can occur following trauma or in contact lens wearers, especially after water exposure.

4. **Herpes simplex keratitis**
   - Viral infection that can cause corneal ulcers.

5. **Microsporidial keratitis**
   - Occurs predominantly in immunocompromised patients but can affect immunocompetent patients, often after water exposure.

6. **Marginal keratitis**
   - Often associated with staphylococcal antigens and an immune response to bacteria on the eyelid margins.

7. **Peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK)**
   - Immune-mediated inflammatory condition often associated with systemic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.

8. **Thygeson's superficial punctate keratitis**
   - Characterized by recurrent episodes of corneal epithelial disease.

9. **Rosacea keratitis**
   - Involves inflammation of the cornea associated with ocular rosacea.

10. **Neurotrophic keratitis**
    - Caused by reduced corneal sensitivity, leading to poor corneal healing.

### Re-ranking Based on Patient Information and Test Results:

Considering the patient's history (contact lens use, freshwater exposure), clinical presentation, and the progression of symptoms after initial treatment, we re-rank the differential diagnoses:

1. **Acanthamoeba keratitis**
   - Strong suspicion due to history of freshwater exposure and soft contact lens use, with worsening symptoms despite initial treatment.

2. **Bacterial keratitis**
   - Highly likely in contact lens wearers; bacteria like Pseudomonas can cause significant corneal damage quickly.

3. **Fungal keratitis**
   - Must remain high on the differential for contact lens wearers, especially given the freshwater exposure.

4. **Herpes simplex keratitis**
   - Though possible, less likely given the absence of previous episodes or typical dendritic pattern.

5. **Microsporidial keratitis**
   - Typically rare but possible with water exposure, should not be overlooked.

6. **Marginal keratitis**
   - Less likely because it usually appears at the periphery and is often associated with lid disease.

7. **Peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK)**
   - Highly unlikely without systemic disease history.

8. **Thygeson's superficial punctate keratitis**
   - Does not typically present with central stromal opacities; more related to recurrent epithelial disease.

9. **Rosacea keratitis**
   - Unlikely without rosacea history or skin findings.

10. **Neurotrophic keratitis**
    - Unlikely due to absence of factors reducing corneal sensitivity; not typically associated with acute inflammatory signs.

### Empirical Treatment Recommendation:

Given the high suspicion for Acanthamoeba keratitis, an aggressive empirical treatment while awaiting culture results is warranted. Recommended treatment includes:

- **Topical Anti-amoebic Agents**:
  - Polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) 0.02% or Chlorhexidine 0.02%.
  - Diamidines such as Propamidine Isethionate (Brolene) 0.1%.

- **Adjunctive Treatment**:
  - Cycloplegic agents for pain.
  - Possible concurrent use of antibiotics if the bacterial superinfection is suspected.

### INPUT:
A 53-year-old man received a diagnosis of stage IV melanoma with metastatic disease to the spine and brain 3 months before presentation. Four weeks following receipt of immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab, he developed acute abdominal pain in the setting of a rapidly rising lactic acid dehydrogenase levels, prompting hospital admission. Imaging results showed mild disease progression (new ascites and periportal metabolic lymph node). Splenic infarct and portal/splenic vein thrombi were identified as etiologies of his acute pain and were presumed to be secondary to hypercoagulable state of malignancy. Over the next 3 days, he had rising serum creatinine (sCr) levels (baseline, approximately 1 mg/dL [to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4]). The initial workup included ultrasonography and urinalysis. Ultrasonography results showed abnormal intraparenchymal flow to both kidneys without evidence of kidney artery stenosis. Urine studies were consistent with prerenal etiology, while the presence of casts suggested acute tubular necrosis. Nephrotoxic medications (omeprazole/pantoprazole) were discontinued. The top differential diagnoses at this juncture included contrast-induced nephropathy or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)–induced acute interstitial nephritis, and empirical high dose steroids were prescribed. Despite observation and steroid treatment, his sCr levels continued to increase over the next 5 days, peaking at 5.8 mg/dL, and the patient progressed into anuric kidney failure, requiring hemodialysis. This prompted a kidney biopsy for definitive diagnosis (Figure). One week later, he received encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor.1 Two weeks later, the patient’s kidney function began to improve, and hemodialysis was discontinued. He continued to show gradual improvement, with a return to near baseline kidney function (sCr level, 1.3 mg/dL) approximately 6 weeks after treatment initiation. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Acute tubular necrosis secondary to kidney melanoma metastasis,"Certainly, we'll proceed step-by-step to identify possible differential diagnoses based on the provided patient scenario, then we'll reevaluate this list considering all patient information and test results.

### Differential Diagnosis Step-by-Step

1. **Contrast-Induced Nephropathy (CIN)**
   - Given the history of rising serum creatinine levels and previous imaging studies, CIN should be considered.

2. **Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI)-Induced Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN)**
   - The patient received immunotherapy, which can cause AIN, as complicating factors appeared shortly after treatment initiation.

3. **Hypercoagulable State due to Malignancy**
   - Malignancy itself can cause a hypercoagulable state, leading to splenic infarct and portal/splenic vein thrombi.

4. **Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN)**
   - Presence of casts in urine studies suggests ATN, commonly due to ischemia or nephrotoxic injury.

5. **Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA)**
   - Malignancies and certain medications can precipitate TMA, characterized by acute renal failure, hypertension, and abnormal blood flow.

6. **Drug-Induced Kidney Injury**
   - Nephrotoxic drugs such as omeprazole/pantoprazole and other potentially new drugs should be considered as causative agents.

7. **Sepsis-Induced Kidney Injury**
   - Infection and sepsis can lead to acute kidney injury, though there's no direct mention of sepsis in the scenario.

8. **Metastatic Disease to Kidneys**
   - The patient has metastatic melanoma, which could potentially metastasize to the kidneys, causing damage.

9. **Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)**
   - High tumor burden and rapid cell turnover due to effective cancer treatment can lead to TLS, resulting in renal impairment.

10. **Autoimmune Disease Exacerbation**
   - Underlying or new-onset autoimmune disease exacerbation, possibly triggered by immunotherapy, contributing to renal failure.

### Reevaluated Differential Diagnoses

Considering all the patient information and test results, we can now rank the differential diagnoses:

1. **Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI)-Induced Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN)**
   - Top possibility given timing with recent immunotherapy, compatible with clinical presentation and the improvement with discontinuation and steroid treatment.

2. **Contrast-Induced Nephropathy (CIN)**
   - Relevant due to prior imaging studies and continued rise in sCr post-diagnosis.

3. **Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN)**
   - Supported by urine studies indicating prerenal etiology and the presence of casts, although improvement with the discontinuation of suspected nephrotoxins lessens this likelihood somewhat.

4. **Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA)**
   - Given hypercoagulable state and history of thrombi, this is still a viable differential but less likely due to response to steroids and improvement post-immunotherapy management.

5. **Hypercoagulable State (Direct Malignancy Effect)**
   - Initial splenic infarct and thrombi are more likely secondary effects.

6. **Drug-Induced Kidney Injury**
   - A possibility, especially with nephrotoxic drugs previously used.

7. **Autoimmune Disease Exacerbation**
   - Could be on the differential due to immunotherapy, yet less likely without more specific symptoms indicating this.

8. **Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)**
   - Less likely due to the nature of renal impairment and the context of treatment timeline.

9. **Sepsis-Induced Kidney Injury**
   - Lower down the list due to lack of specific signs of infection or sepsis in the history provided.

10. **Metastatic Disease to Kidneys**
    - Less likely as primary cause given improvement with targeted therapies for underlying melanoma and response to steroid treatment.

A 71-year-old man with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and type 2 diabetes presented to the otolaryngology team with 6 weeks’ history of pain and ulcers in the pharynx. He also complained of nasal regurgitation. He denied having any systemic symptoms. He took linagliptin, valsartan, and 15 mg of methotrexate weekly. He was a nonsmoker and consumed very little alcohol. Clinical examination including flexible nasendoscopy revealed multiple shallow ulcers on the posterior wall of the nasopharynx. There was a large defect involving the entire soft palate on the left. There was no obvious mass or any exophytic lesion. The edges of the soft palate defect were smooth and clean (Figure 1). There were no cranial nerve palsies. There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Findings of the remaining head and neck examinations were normal. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Rheumatoid Arthritis-Related Amyloidosis**
   - Due to the patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis, secondary amyloidosis is a consideration.

2. **Methotrexate-Induced Ulcers**
   - Methotrexate, a common medication for rheumatoid arthritis, can cause mucosal ulcers as a side effect.

3. **Mucormycosis**
   - Opportunistic mycosis, especially given the patient's diabetes.

4. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**
   - Malignancy presenting with ulceration and soft tissue defects in the oropharynx and nasopharynx.

5. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**
   - Typically presents with nasal and oral lesions, and the patient's autoimmune comorbidity supports this hypothesis.

6. **Lupus Vulgaris (Tuberculosis of the Skin)**
   - Scrofula or mucocutaneous manifestations of tuberculosis could fit the ulcerative profile.

7. **Syphilis**
   - Primary or tertiary syphilis can cause mucosal ulcerations.

8. **Diabetes-Related Poor Healing**
   - The diabetes might predispose the patient to poor healing and infection resulting in ulcerations.

9. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**
   - An autoimmune blistering disorder often involving mucosal surfaces.

10. **Drug-Induced Lupus**
    - Caused by certain medications, including methotrexate, potentially leading to mucosal ulcerations.

### Reranking Based on Full Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Methotrexate-Induced Ulcers**
   - Given the medication regimen and typical clinical side effect profile involving mucosal ulcerations.

2. **Mucormycosis**
   - Considering the patient's diabetes, which increases susceptibility to infections like mucormycosis.

3. **Rheumatoid Arthritis-Related Amyloidosis**
   - Chronic inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis can lead to secondary amyloidosis affecting multiple organs including mucosa.

4. **Diabetes-Related Poor Healing**
   - Diabetes is a strong predictor of poor wound healing which could contribute to persistent ulcerative lesions.

5. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**
   - Fits well with ulcerative and necrotizing lesions of the upper respiratory tract.

6. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**
   - Although less likely due to the absence of mass or nodal involvement, malignancy is a differential that cannot be entirely ruled out.

7. **Syphilis**
   - Though less common, tertiary syphilis can present with similar ulcerations.

8. **Lupus Vulgaris (Tuberculosis of the Skin)**
   - Less likely but possible given ulcerative plaques could be seen in TB.

9. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**
   - An autoimmune etiology that would require specific tests which are not provided in the presented scenario.

### INPUT:
A patient in their early 20s with no medical history or previous symptoms presented for severe frontal headaches and progressive blurred vision in the left eye more than the right eye for several weeks. No localizing signs were documented on neurologic examination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast, magnetic resonance angiography of the head, and magnetic resonance venography of the head were obtained and were unremarkable. The result of a lumbar puncture showed 101 white blood cells per high-power field (75% lymphocytes). Results of syphilis serologic tests were negative. The patient was discharged with suspected viral meningitis. At a follow-up visit in an ophthalmology clinic 1 week after discharge, visual acuity was 20/25 OD and counting fingers OS. There was no afferent pupillary defect, and an anterior segment examination was within normal limits. A dilated fundus examination showed numerous bilateral creamy-yellow lesions in the peripheral retina with discrete nummular lesions in the posterior pole (Figure 1A). Fundus autofluorescence showed focal areas of hypoautofluorescence with surrounding hyperautofluorescence in both eyes (Figure 1B). The patient continued to report severe and progressive headaches along with blurred vision. A review of systems was otherwise unremarkable. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Acute Retinal Necrosis (ARN)** – Considering the bilateral creamy-yellow lesions and nummular lesions in the posterior pole, ARN is a pertinent differential.
2. **Toxoplasmosis** – Given the retinal lesions and immune status, ocular toxoplasmosis should be considered.
3. **Tuberculosis** – Tuberculous meningitis can present similarly with white cells in CSF and ocular lesions.
4. **Behçet's Disease** – Given younger age and bilateral ocular findings, the possibility of an inflammatory vasculitis like Behçet's disease.
5. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)** – Severe headaches and visual disturbances can suggest IIH, though the normal MRI/MRV makes this less likely.
6. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Encephalitis** – Severe headaches and potential for viral-induced ocular issues make this a differential.
7. **Sarcoidosis** – Multisystem disorder that can present with uveitis and CNS involvement.
8. **Primary CNS Lymphoma** – Uncommon in this age group but can present with progressive vision loss and headaches.
9. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)** – Demyelinating illness can present with vision issues and headaches.
10. **Lyme Disease** – Given exposure history and neurological signs, Lyme neuroborreliosis remains a differential.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
After reviewing all patient information and test results, let’s re-evaluate:

1. **Acute Retinal Necrosis (ARN)** – The presence of creamy-yellow retinal lesions, nummular lesions in the posterior pole, and severe headaches with blurry vision strongly suggest an infective etiology, ARN being at the top given the retinal findings.
  
2. **Toxoplasmosis** – Still highly probable due to characteristic retinal findings and CNS involvement (lymphocytic pleocytosis in CSF).

3. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Encephalitis** – HSV can cause severe headaches and ocular findings, though usually would have MRI findings.

4. **Behçet's Disease** – Bilateral eye involvement and CNS symptoms warrant its consideration.

5. **Sarcoidosis** – Systemic granulomatous disease with CNS and ocular involvement fits the symptoms, despite age.

6. **Tuberculosis** – Atypical in presentation and demographics but still a differential due to the lymphocytic pleocytosis in CSF.

7. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)** – Visual disturbances and neurological symptoms align but less likely with the current retinal findings.

8. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)** – Severe headaches and vision changes fit, though MRI findings do not support it.

9. **Primary CNS Lymphoma** – Uncommon, especially in this age group, but possible with unexplained neurological and ocular involvement.

10. **Lyme Disease** – Primarily included due to CNS lymphocytic pleocytosis, though not primary based on ocular findings.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 70s was referred to the dermatology department by the rheumatology department with concerns for vasculitis of the bilateral lower legs. She had been healthy until 6 years earlier when she had suddenly developed peripheral neuropathy, with subsequent workup revealing a diagnosis of immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Her symptoms had rapidly progressed during the past few months. In addition to worsening neuropathy, she had developed fatigue, weight loss, and sudden altered mental status. An ischemic stroke was identified. The patient was hospitalized, and extensive diagnostic examinations and procedures were completed. A lymphoproliferative disorder with plasmocytic differentiation was detected in a bone marrow biopsy specimen, which together with the monoclonal IgM paraproteinemia was consistent with Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM). Weeks later, the patient developed an asymptomatic rash of her lower legs. A physical examination revealed several bright red, nonblanchable, pinpoint macules of the bilateral lower legs (Figure, A). An antinuclear antibody test result was positive (titer 1:320, diffuse pattern). Other laboratory testing procedures (ie, complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anti-Sjogren syndrome [SS]-A and SS-B, anti–double-stranded DNA, complement [C]3 and C4, homocysteine, β-2-glycoprotein, anticardiolipin, lupus anticoagulant, and vitamin C) returned normal. A punch biopsy of the right lower leg was performed for further diagnostic evaluation (Figure, B-D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cutaneous macroglobulinosis,"**Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps:**

1. **Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM)** - Given the patient's history, presence of monoclonal IgM paraproteinemia, and bone marrow findings.
2. **Cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis** - Presenting symptoms such as nonblanchable pinpoint macules and possible vascular involvement.
3. **Peripheral neuropathy** - Symptoms exhibited by the patient including sudden development of peripheral neuropathy.
4. **Antiphospholipid syndrome** - Considering the ischemic stroke and positive antinuclear antibody test.
5. **Immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)** - Previous diagnosis, even though now overshadowed by WM.
6. **Cryoglobulinemia** - Given monoclonal IgM paraproteinemia and vascular symptoms.
7. **Primary systemic amyloidosis** - Rapid progression of symptoms, including peripheral neuropathy, weight loss, and fatigue.
8. **Hyperviscosity syndrome** - Associated with WM and might explain altered mental status and ischemic stroke.
9. **Trousseau syndrome** - Potential paraneoplastic syndrome that could explain ischemic stroke.
10. **Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)** - Given lymphoproliferative disorder detected in bone marrow biopsy, might overlap with WM.

**Re-ranked Differential Diagnosis Considering Complete Patient Information and Test Results:**

1. **Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM)** - Confirmed by monoclonal IgM paraproteinemia and bone marrow biopsy; primary diagnosis.
2. **Cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis** - Consistent with skin findings from the biopsy and nonblanchable pinpoint macules.
3. **Hyperviscosity syndrome** - Symptomology matches with WM and could explain neurological and ischemic events.
4. **Cryoglobulinemia** - Secondary condition often seen with monoclonal gammopathies which fits clinical presentation.
5. **Primary systemic amyloidosis** - Could explain progressive neuropathy, fatigue, and weight loss; requires further exclusion.
6. **Peripheral neuropathy** - Secondary to primary diagnosis; progression aligns with WM symptoms.
7. **Immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)** - Recognized in historical context; now considered less relevant.
8. **Antiphospholipid syndrome** - Less likely given negative antiphospholipid panel despite presence of ischemic stroke.
9. **Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)** - Considered in initial bone marrow findings but secondary to confirmed WM.
10. **Trousseau syndrome** - Less likely without thromboembolic history and proven neoplasia suggesting other thrombotic risk factors.

### INPUT:
A man in his early 70s with a history of permanent atrial fibrillation treated with atrioventricular junction ablation and biventricular pacemaker implantation was hospitalized with decompensated heart failure and acute kidney injury. His history was notable for nonischemic cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 40% and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, for which he underwent single-lung transplant 9 years prior. Following diuresis and medical optimization, repeated echocardiogram showed a newly depressed ejection fraction (30%). His electrocardiogram (ECG) was notable for alternating QRS morphologies (Figure 1A). The left ventricular (LV) pacing vector was programmed from LV tip to right ventricular (RV) lead ring. During pacemaker threshold testing, a change in QRS morphology was observed as the output was reduced (Figure 1B). Chest radiography revealed severe right pulmonary fibrosis leading to ipsilateral mediastinal shift and pacemaker lead position unchanged from implantation. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Anodal capture,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Pacemaker Lead Dysfunction**
2. **Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) Non-response**
3. **Pacemaker-Mediated Tachycardia**
4. **Ventricular Tachycardia**
5. **Pacemaker Syndrome**
6. **Coronary Artery Disease**
7. **Cardiac Sarcoidosis**
8. **Dilated Cardiomyopathy**
9. **Tricuspid Valve Regurgitation**
10. **Aortic Stenosis**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Pacemaker Lead Dysfunction**: The change in QRS morphology on ECG during threshold testing and the patient's history of biventricular pacemaker implantation strongly suggest pacemaker lead dysfunction as the primary issue. A thorough examination of lead integrity and positioning is crucial.

2. **Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) Non-response**: The underlying nonischemic cardiomyopathy and observed newly depressed ejection fraction (30%) indicate potential non-response to CRT, particularly in the context of the patient's complex history.

3. **Ventricular Tachycardia**: The alternating QRS morphologies could hint at intermittent ventricular tachycardia, particularly in a patient with cardiomyopathy and a pacemaker.

4. **Pacemaker-Mediated Tachycardia**: The presence of decompensated heart failure symptoms and the patient's history of atrial fibrillation make pacemaker-mediated tachycardia a plausible diagnosis.

5. **Pacemaker Syndrome**: Symptoms and changes in QRS morphology could align with pacemaker syndrome, particularly if the device placement or settings are suboptimal.

6. **Dilated Cardiomyopathy**: The nonischemic cardiomyopathy and reduced ejection fraction could indicate worsening or progressing dilated cardiomyopathy.

7. **Tricuspid Valve Regurgitation**: The pacemaker lead traversing the tricuspid valve can cause or exacerbate tricuspid valve regurgitation, leading to heart failure symptoms.

8. **Aortic Stenosis**: In an elderly patient with heart failure symptoms, aortic stenosis could be a contributing factor, especially if there's any indication of calcification on imaging.

9. **Cardiac Sarcoidosis**: Given the patient's history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cardiac sarcoidosis should be considered, although it's less common.

10. **Coronary Artery Disease**: While less likely to be the primary cause in this specific scenario, coronary artery disease remains a differential, particularly given age and heart failure symptoms.

To converge on a definitive diagnosis, further targeted diagnostic testing such as pacemaker interrogation, advanced cardiac imaging, and perhaps electrophysiological studies is warranted.","['Rhythm Disorders', 'Cardiology', 'Heart Failure', 'Medical Devices and Equipment']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,70.0,M

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old man with melanoma and a history of papillary thyroid cancer treated with thyroidectomy presented with 1 week of low-grade fevers, myalgias, and proximal muscle weakness. Three months earlier, he underwent digital amputation of his right third finger and began adjuvant nivolumab treatment for stage IIIC acral-lentiginous melanoma. One week later, he developed fevers, myalgias, dark urine, weakness, and difficulty walking. He had no palpitations, chest pain, or shortness of breath. On examination, his blood pressure was 135/86 mm Hg, pulse 78/min, and he was afebrile. He had reduced strength in bilateral proximal shoulders (3/5), elbow flexors/extensors (3/5), and forearm flexors/extensors (4+/5). No rashes were noted. Laboratory studies demonstrated a creatine kinase (CK) level of 111 859 U/L (reference range, 30-220 U/L), CK-MB of 270 ng/mL (reference, <8 ng/mL), and aldolase above 500 U/L (reference, <7.7 U/L). Aspartate aminotransferase level was 1980 U/L (reference range, 15-41 U/L), alanine aminotransferase was 814 U/L (reference range, 14-54 U/L), creatinine was 4.9 mg/dL (reference range, 0.4-1.0 mg/dL) with a previously normal baseline, and potassium was 6.4 mmol/L (reference range, 3.5-5.0 mmol/L). Urinalysis showed 27 red blood cells (reference range, 0-5) and myoglobin above 5000 µg/L (reference, 0 µg/L). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 67 mm/h (reference, <20 mm/h) and C-reactive protein was 10.2 mg/dL (reference, ≤0.60 mg/dL). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left humerus demonstrated T2 flare most pronounced within the biceps and anterior lateral deltoid muscles (Figure). The patient’s electrocardiogram (ECG) is also shown in the Figure. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Nivolumab-induced myositis with myocarditis,"To form a differential diagnosis, let's analyze the patient's symptoms, history, examination findings, and test results step by step.

1. **Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced Myositis**: Given the recent use of nivolumab (an immune checkpoint inhibitor), which is known to cause immune-related adverse events, including myositis.
2. **Rhabdomyolysis**: Presence of elevated CK levels, muscle weakness, dark urine, and elevated myoglobin suggest muscle breakdown.
3. **Polymyositis**: Proximal muscle weakness and elevated muscle enzymes might indicate this inflammatory myopathy.
4. **Dermatomyositis**: Although typically associated with skin findings, it should be considered due to the presentation of muscle inflammation and weakness.
5. **Necrotizing Autoimmune Myopathy**: Given the rapid onset and severe symptoms, this severe inflammatory muscle disorder should be considered.
6. **Hyperkalemia-Induced Muscle Weakness**: Elevated potassium levels can lead to muscle weakness and should be evaluated as a secondary cause.
7. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**: The patient's elevated creatinine suggests renal involvement, possibly secondary to rhabdomyolysis.
8. **Infectious Myositis**: Considering the fever and elevated inflammatory markers, an infectious cause of muscle inflammation should be considered.
9. **Hypothyroid Myopathy**: Although the patient had a thyroidectomy, inadequate thyroid hormone replacement could lead to muscle symptoms.
10. **Melanoma Metastasis to Muscle**: Given the patient's history of melanoma, metastasis to muscle could manifest as muscle weakness.

### Ranking after combining patient information and test results:

1. **Rhabdomyolysis**: The extremely elevated CK, myoglobinuria, and muscle symptoms are classic features.
2. **Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced Myositis**: Nivolumab therapy aligns with onset of symptoms.
3. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**: Elevated creatinine and risk factors from rhabdomyolysis.
4. **Hyperkalemia-Induced Muscle Weakness**: Elevated potassium requires urgent attention to avoid cardiac complications.
5. **Necrotizing Autoimmune Myopathy**: Severe and rapid symptom onset with high muscle enzyme levels.
6. **Polymyositis**: Consistent with proximal muscle weakness and elevated muscle enzymes.
7. **Infectious Myositis**: Fever and elevated inflammatory markers are suggestive.
8. **Dermatomyositis**: Muscle involvement without skin manifestations is possible, though less likely.
9. **Hypothyroid Myopathy**: Should be ruled out given muscle symptoms post-thyroidectomy.
10. **Melanoma Metastasis to Muscle**: Least likely considering the presentation but pertinent due to history.","['Cardiology', 'Dermatology', 'Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology', 'Melanoma', 'Oncology']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,47.0,M

### INPUT:
A 58-year-old man with a history of hypertensive retinopathy presented with acute-onset, painless vision loss in his right eye accompanied by tinnitus and severe intermittent headaches. His extraocular movements were full, and he had no other neurologic deficits. His visual acuity was 20/400 OD and 20/30 OS, respectively, and his fundi were notable for bilateral optic nerve edema. Results of recent computed tomography and angiography of the head and neck and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits were reportedly normal, and lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 26 cm H2O (normal range, 6 to 25 cm H2O) with elevated protein. The patient was given acetazolamide and referred to neuro-ophthalmology. On examination by neuro-ophthalmology 4 months later, his visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/20 OS. He had an afferent pupillary defect in the right eye, and Humphrey visual fields (24-2) showed binasal inferior defects with a superior defect in the right eye that was considered an artifact of testing. According to the Ishihara color plates test, color vision was full in both eyes. Fundus examination was remarkable for pallor of both optic nerves, more notably in the right eye, without edema (Figure 1). Findings of screening for antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, angiotensin-converting enzyme, Bartonella, HIV, tuberculosis (Quantiferon), Treponema pallidum, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and a complete blood cell count were normal. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Primary angiitis of the central nervous system,"Based on the patient's history, symptoms, examination findings, and test results provided, let's think through a differential diagnosis stepwise:

### Stepwise Differential Diagnosis
1. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO):**
   - Acute, painless vision loss with a history of hypertensive retinopathy.

2. **Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (ION):**
   - Optic nerve pallor, afferent pupillary defect, and symptoms consistent with optic nerve ischemia.

3. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH):**
   - Bilateral optic nerve edema, elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture.

4. **Optic Neuritis:**
   - Acute vision loss with optic nerve involvement and some improvement over time; common in demyelinating diseases but would typically expect some pain with movement.

5. **Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA):**
   - Excluded due to normal ESR and CRP but considered initially due to age, visual symptoms, and headaches.

6. **Toxic or Nutritional Optic Neuropathy:**
   - Presents with optic nerve pallor; however, typically bilateral and gradual onset; patient has more acute presentation.

7. **Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON):**
   - Sudden vision loss, more common in younger males, can present with optic nerve pallor.

8. **Chronic Papilledema:**
   - Response to acetazolamide and bilateral optic nerve pallor from chronic elevated intracranial pressure.

9. **Optic Atrophy from Previous Optic Neuritis or Neuropathy:**
   - Pallor of optic nerves and visual field defects.

10. **Retinal Artery Embolism:**
   - Can cause sudden vision loss, but it would usually be more definitive findings on fundoscopic examination.

### Rerank Differential Diagnosis
Considering the thorough history, investigations, clinical findings, and more chronic management perspective provided:

1. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH):**
   - Elevated lumbar puncture opening pressure, bilateral optic nerve edema initially, improvement with acetazolamide.
   
2. **Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (ION):**
   - Optic nerve pallor and afferent pupillary defect, history of hypertensive retinopathy.

3. **Chronic Papilledema:**
   - Associated with elevated intracranial pressure, chronic condition leading to optic nerve pallor.

4. **Optic Neuritis:**
   - Though acute visual improvement, typically expect painful eye movements, but pallor can follow.

5. **Retinal Artery Embolism:**
   - Acute vision loss with optic nerve involvement; rare without more fundoscopic abnormalities.

6. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO):**
   - Acute and painless with significant vision loss; however, less supportive findings on detailed fundus examination provided.

7. **Optic Atrophy from Previous Optic Neuritis or Neuropathy:**
   - Past history not strongly supportive but chronic findings fit.

8. **Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA):**
   - Age and symptoms fitting, but significant laboratory investigations are not supportive.

9. **Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON):**
   - Typically younger, but optic nerve pallor is fitting.

10. **Toxic or Nutritional Optic Neuropathy:**
    - Less likely given acute onset and specific clinical scenario.

The diagnosis of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) appears most likely based on clinical improvements with acetazolamide and characteristic presentation of elevated lumbar puncture pressures in the context of chronic symptoms fitting this condition.","['Ophthalmology', 'Retinal Disorders', 'Headache', 'Neurology', 'Neuro-ophthalmology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,58.0,M

### INPUT:
A 36-year-old man presented to the emergency department with 3 weeks of generalized weakness and a dry cough. He reported hair loss for 1 month. Medical history was significant for opioid and alcohol use disorders, injection drug use, and chronic HIV infection. He discontinued his antiretroviral therapy 2 years prior to presentation. At that time, his CD4+ cell count was 820/μL and his HIV viral load was undetectable. On presentation, his heart rate was 88/min and regular; blood pressure, 90/58 mm Hg; oxygen saturation, 100% on room air; and respiratory rate, 20/min. He was afebrile. Cardiorespiratory auscultation was deferred because a diagnosis of COVID-19 was considered. He had a faint maculopapular rash on his arms and torso and patchy hair loss on his scalp (Figure). There were no genital lesions or mucosal ulcerations. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",“Moth-eaten” alopecia caused by secondary syphilis,"To develop a differential diagnosis based on the provided information, let's proceed step by step.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP)**
   - Given the patient's HIV infection and history of discontinuing antiretroviral therapy, PJP is a significant opportunistic infection to consider, especially with the presentation of generalized weakness and dry cough.

2. **Tuberculosis (TB)**
   - Considering the history of injection drug use, chronic HIV infection, and respiratory symptoms (although dry), TB is a probable diagnosis.

3. **Kaposi's Sarcoma**
   - The patient has an HIV infection and presents with a rash. Kaposi's sarcoma is often associated with HIV/AIDS, particularly when antiretroviral therapy is discontinued.

4. **Syphilis**
   - The faint maculopapular rash, patchy hair loss, and historical context suggest the possibility of secondary syphilis. This sexually transmitted infection is more common in individuals with a history of drug use and HIV.

5. **Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)**
   - Another opportunistic infection seen in HIV patients, particularly those with low CD4 counts. Symptoms can include generalized weakness and systemic illness.

6. **Histoplasmosis**
   - This fungal infection can be seen in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with HIV, leading to generalized symptoms and pulmonary involvement.

7. **COVID-19**
   - Given the ongoing pandemic and the mention of deferred respiratory auscultation, COVID-19 remains a consideration, particularly given the immune-compromised state of the patient.

8. **Bacterial Endocarditis**
   - In a patient with injection drug use history, endocarditis is a possibility, especially if experiencing non-specific symptoms like generalized weakness.

9. **Alcoholic Hepatitis**
   - The history of alcohol use disorder, combined with fatigue and systemic symptoms, suggests a potential for liver-related issues such as alcoholic hepatitis.

10. **Adrenal Insufficiency**
    - The low blood pressure (90/58 mm Hg) and generalized weakness can be indicative of adrenal insufficiency, potentially exacerbated by chronic illness and HIV.

### Reranking Differential Diagnosis Based on Information:

1. **Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)**
   - Given immunocompromised status, systemic symptoms, and potential for low CD4+ count.

2. **Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP)**
    - Strongly correlates with immunocompromised state and respiratory symptoms.

3. **Tuberculosis (TB)**
    - High risk due to injection drug use, history of HIV, and systemic symptoms.

4. **Kaposi's Sarcoma**
    - HIV-related with dermatologic manifestations including rashes and systemic symptoms.

5. **Syphilis**
    - Secondary stage could explain rash and hair loss in the context of HIV.

6. **Histoplasmosis**
    - Fungal infection relevant in immune-compromised patients leading to systemic and pulmonary symptoms.

7. **Bacterial Endocarditis**
    - Injection drug use history heightens risk; systemic non-specific symptoms.

8. **Adrenal Insufficiency**
    - Reflects hypotension and generalized weakness.

9. **Alcoholic Hepatitis**
    - History of alcohol abuse, bearing systemic weakness and malaise.

10. **COVID-19**
    - Due to current pandemic and compromised immune status, remains in differential despite lower clinical suspicion compared to other conditions.

This structured approach helps in narrowing down the possible diagnoses and prioritizing the most probable ones given the current clinical presentation and patient history.","['Hair Disorders', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections', 'HIV', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Dermatology']",0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,36.0,M

### INPUT:
A 64-year-old woman with a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, HIV infection, coronary artery disease, and squamous cell carcinoma of the left mandible treated with composite resection, left neck dissection, and fibula free flap (FFF) reconstruction followed by postoperative radiotherapy presented with sharp, shooting left neck pain. Beginning 5 months after her reconstruction, the patient reported point tenderness on the left jaw, facial swelling, and electric pain with severity of 7 out of 10 in the left neck that occurred with talking or eating. Her postoperative course was complicated by osteoradionecrosis post-tracheostomy, plate removal, and left segmental mandibulectomy. She received regular physical therapy and lymphedema therapy and was seen by Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, who treated her with onabotulinum toxin A injections; neither provided significant resolution of her symptoms. Review of a computed tomography scan of the head and neck (Figure 1) performed on follow-up 5 years after initial reconstruction demonstrated a long, hyperdense structure in the left submental, submandibular region with accompanying soft-tissue thickening. On further review of prior imaging, this calcification appeared as a new finding in various scans dating back to 5 months after FFF reconstruction compared with preoperative imaging. There was no fluorodeoxyglucose avidity in the area of question on multiple positron emission tomography scans done during this follow-up window. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Ossification of the free flap pedicle,"To develop a differential diagnosis for this patient's symptoms, we must consider her medical history, symptoms, and imaging findings step by step:

### Initial Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Osteoradionecrosis** 
   - Reasoning: Given the history of radiotherapy and subsequent osteoradionecrosis post-tracheostomy and mandibulectomy, this condition is likely to cause persistent pain and new calcifications.

### Second Differential Diagnosis:
2. **Chronic Osteomyelitis**
   - Reasoning: The history of multiple surgical interventions and previous osteoradionecrosis could predispose the patient to secondary infections, leading to chronic osteomyelitis.

### Third Differential Diagnosis:
3. **Trigeminal Neuralgia**
   - Reasoning: Sharp, electric pain in the face and neck triggered by movement could point towards neuropathic pain such as trigeminal neuralgia.

### Fourth Differential Diagnosis:
4. **Post-Surgical Neuropathy**
   - Reasoning: The extensive surgical procedures and subsequent physical therapy suggest the possibility of neuropathic pain directly related to nerve damage during surgery.

### Fifth Differential Diagnosis:
5. **Fibrosis and Scar Tissue**
   - Reasoning: Post-operative and post-radiotherapy changes often result in fibrosis and scar tissue formation, which can cause pain and calcifications.

### Sixth Differential Diagnosis:
6. **Sialolithiasis**
   - Reasoning: The location of the pain and the new calcification in the submandibular region could indicate a salivary gland stone.

### Seventh Differential Diagnosis:
7. **Invasive Squamous Cell Carcinoma Recurrence**
   - Reasoning: Given her history of squamous cell carcinoma and aggressive therapy, there is potential for local recurrence, although less likely due to lack of FDG avidity.

### Eighth Differential Diagnosis:
8. **Atypical Facial Pain Syndrome**
   - Reasoning: Pain syndromes that do not fit into specific neuropathic or musculoskeletal categories may be considered, especially given the chronicity and severity of pain.

### Ninth Differential Diagnosis:
9. **Lymphadenitis**
   - Reasoning: Inflammatory or infectious processes within the lymph nodes due to chronic conditions can cause pain and swelling.

### Tenth Differential Diagnosis:
10. **Radiation-Induced Vasculopathy**
    - Reasoning: Previous radiation therapy can lead to vascular changes or vasculopathy which may result in pain.

### Reranking Using All Patient Information and Test Results:
Based on reevaluating all patient information including the imaging results showing a new calcification, lack of FDG avidity, and the chronic nature of symptoms, we can rerank the differential diagnoses as follows:

1. **Chronic Osteomyelitis**
2. **Osteoradionecrosis**
3. **Post-Surgical Neuropathy**
4. **Fibrosis and Scar Tissue**
5. **Sialolithiasis**
6. **Trigeminal Neuralgia**
7. **Radiation-Induced Vasculopathy**
8. **Invasive Squamous Cell Carcinoma Recurrence**
9. **Atypical Facial Pain Syndrome**
10. **Lymphadenitis**

This ranking reflects the likelihood of conditions based on the chronic presentation of symptoms, the specific imaging findings of new calcifications, and the contribution of the patient's extensive surgical and therapeutic history.","['Facial Plastic Surgery', 'Otolaryngology', 'Head and Neck Reconstruction', 'Pain Medicine', 'Radiation Oncology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,64.0,F

### INPUT:
A man in his late 70s with stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung presented with acute onset of redness, pain, and swelling of both lower limbs. The patient had received 4 cycles of chemotherapy with carboplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab for progressive disease and was currently in maintenance with pemetrexed-pembrolizumab. The edema appeared 5 days after the patient’s 8th cycle of chemotherapy and evolved into sclerotic plaques. Physical examination revealed ill-defined, erythematoedematous plaques symmetrically distributed along the shins, with areas of induration (Figure, A). The patient remained afebrile and systemically well. Results of laboratory tests showed no elevation of inflammatory markers (normal white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level), with kidney, liver, and heart functions within the normal ranges. Results of venous Doppler ultrasonography imaging of the patient’s legs did not show evidence of deep vein thrombosis. A biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathologic analysis (Figure, B and C). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pemetrexed-induced inflammatory and sclerotic edema,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:
1. **Dermatomyositis**: Consider the symmetric distribution of erythematous and edematous plaques, especially in a patient with underlying malignancy.
2. **Cellulitis**: Given the acute onset of redness, pain, and swelling, though afebrile and absence of systemic symptoms makes it less likely.
3. **Venous Insufficiency**: Swelling in lower limbs often presents due to venous problems, though Doppler ultrasonography was negative for DVT.
4. **Drug Reaction**: Chemotherapy agents can cause various cutaneous reactions, including erythema and induration.
5. **Radiation Dermatitis**: Prior radiation could cause local skin changes but likely would not be symmetric.
6. **Eosinophilic Fasciitis**: Presents with indurated plaques and associated with a paraneoplastic phenomenon.
7. **Scleroderma**: Systemic sclerosis can present with skin changes but typically involves more widespread systems.
8. **Sweet’s Syndrome**: Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, though fever is typically present.
9. **Metastatic Skin Lesions**: Lung cancer can metastasize to the skin, presenting as nodules or plaques.
10. **Paraneoplastic Pemphigus**: Rare and can present with various cutaneous eruptions associated with malignancy.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis (Based on full Information and Test Results):
1. **Drug Reaction**: High likelihood due to temporal correlation with chemotherapy, and the specific agents known to cause such reactions.
2. **Eosinophilic Fasciitis**: Symmetric indurated plaques suggestive of underlying malignancy association.
3. **Dermatomyositis**: Cutaneous findings with known malignancy linkage, though less certain without muscle involvement.
4. **Scleroderma**: Considering indurated skin changes, but systemically well.
5. **Sweet’s Syndrome**: Acute presentation fits, but absence of fever makes it less likely.
6. **Metastatic Skin Lesions**: Potential for unusual skin presentations in advanced lung cancer.
7. **Venous Insufficiency**: Always a consideration in lower limb edema, but less likely due to negative Doppler.
8. **Paraneoplastic Pemphigus**: Uncommon, but its association with malignancy and cutaneous eruptions remains a consideration.
9. **Radiation Dermatitis**: Less likely without a history of radiation therapy in the affected regions.
10. **Cellulitis**: Acute erythema with swelling, but lack of infection signs and normal inflammatory markers make it less probable.","['Dermatology', 'Oncology', 'Targeted and Immune Therapy', 'Lung Cancer']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,70.0,M

### INPUT:
A 66-year-old man presented with multiple progressive ulcers on the right side of his face that had developed over the past 3 months (Figure, A). He had also experienced a burning sensation on the right side of his face, but denied headache, shoulder, or jaw pain and visual disturbance. Neurological examination revealed hypoesthesia of the right side of the face, while cold-warm sensation and motor function were intact. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 82 mm per hour (normal value, less than 15 mm per hour) and the serum C–reactive protein concentration was 107 mg/L (normal value, less than 5 mg/L). Chest radiography showed bilateral perihilar infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. About 2 weeks before the ulcerations developed, the patient had been admitted to the hospital for unstable angina, and coronary angiography was performed. Immediately after the angiography, the patient developed left-sided hemiplegia and hemianopsia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed an extensive ischemic posterior circulation stroke involving the right occipital lobe, lower cerebellar peduncle, and pontomedullary boundary (Figure, B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Trigeminal trophic syndrome,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps

1. **Herpes Zoster (Shingles)**: Given the location and nature of the ulcers along with the burning sensation on one side of the face, herpes zoster involving the trigeminal nerve should be considered.
   
2. **Vasculitis (Giant Cell Arteritis)**: The patient’s age, elevated ESR, and CRP, along with neurological symptoms, raise the suspicion of giant cell arteritis.

3. **Leprosy (Hansen’s Disease)**: Progressive hypoesthetic ulcers and age suggest the need to consider leprosy.

4. **Rheumatoid Vasculitis**: Chronic ulcers and inflammation markers could suggest rheumatoid vasculitis.

5. **Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis**: Involvement of the face with ulcerations might suggest this tropical disease.

6. **Diabetes Mellitus-Related Necrobiosis Lipoidica**: Considering possible undiagnosed diabetes leading to chronic ulcers and inflammatory markers elevation.

7. **Malignancy (Squamous Cell Carcinoma)**: Progressive non-healing ulcers on the face should also raise suspicion for a cutaneous malignancy like squamous cell carcinoma.

8. **Sarcoidosis**: Bilateral perihilar infiltrates consistent with pneumonia can be part of systemic sarcoidosis.

9. **Infection (Bacterial Necrotizing Fasciitis)**: Could be a superimposed or primary bacterial infection causing progressive ulcers and systemic inflammation.

10. **Connective Tissue Disease (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus)**: Ulcerations along with stroke and systemic symptoms can be seen in connective tissue diseases.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis After All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Herpes Zoster (Shingles)**: The unilateral nature, burning sensation, hypoesthesia, and lack of motor involvement strongly suggest herpes zoster involving the V1 branch of the trigeminal nerve.
   
2. **Malignancy (Squamous Cell Carcinoma)**: Non-healing progressive ulcers on the face remain a significant concern and should not be overlooked even with neurological and inflammatory symptoms.

3. **Vasculitis (Giant Cell Arteritis)**: High ESR and CRP, stroke, age, and symptoms of an inflammatory condition point towards vasculitis like giant cell arteritis.

4. **Infection (Bacterial Necrotizing Fasciitis)**: Rapidly progressive damage and systemic inflammation cannot rule out severe underlying infections.

5. **Sarcoidosis**: With systemic signs including bilateral perihilar infiltrates and facial involvement, systemic sarcoidosis is plausible.

6. **Rheumatoid Vasculitis**: Inflammatory markers and persistent ulcerations are consistent with systemic rheumatoid involvement.

7. **Leprosy (Hansen’s Disease)**: Chronic progressive ulcers and facial hypoesthesia still suggest consideration of this neural involvement disease.

8. **Connective Tissue Disease (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus)**: A systemic connective tissue disease with neurological impact continues to be in the differential.

9. **Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis**: Given the less common presentation, tropical disease resulting in facial ulcerations remains a differential, especially with travel history.

10. **Diabetes Mellitus-Related Necrobiosis Lipoidica**: Although less likely, considering chronic systemic metabolic diseases contributing to persistent cutaneous lesions may be needed.

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old man presented with gradual onset of blurry vision in both eyes for several months. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/40 OS. Intraocular pressure was 23 mm Hg in both eyes and was more than 21 mm Hg in both eyes on multiple visits. Medical history included hypertension, obesity, left adrenalectomy, and pterygium excision surgery in the left eye. The patient denied previous episodes of blurry vision, history of corticosteroid use, sleep apnea, or type-A personality. Complete review of systems was otherwise negative. Amsler grid testing revealed paracentral metamorphopsia in both eyes. Extraocular motility, pupillary light reactions, and confrontational visual fields were normal. Slitlamp examination and gonioscopy results were normal in both eyes. An external photograph of the patient is shown in Figure 1A. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated multiple areas of late pinpoint leakage and patches of mottled hyperfluorescence in both eyes (Figure 1B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Bilateral central serous chorioretinopathy secondary to pituitary microadenoma,"Let's proceed step by step with the differential diagnosis:

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis 

**Step 1:** Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR)
- Based on paracentral metamorphopsia and multiple areas of mottled hyperfluorescence on fluorescein angiography.

**Step 2:** Open-Angle Glaucoma
- Elevated intraocular pressure noted on multiple visits.

**Step 3:** Diabetic Retinopathy
- History of obesity; consider glucose metabolism issues.

**Step 4:** Hypertensive Retinopathy
- History of hypertension.

**Step 5:** Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
- Gradual onset of blurry vision and changes seen on fluorescein angiography.

**Step 6:** Adrenal Gland Disorder Impact
- History of left adrenalectomy; potential hormonal impacts on vision.

**Step 7:** Pseudotumor Cerebri
- Given obesity and elevated intraocular pressure.

**Step 8:** Retinal Vein Occlusion
- Fluorescein angiography findings and sudden visual impairment possibility.

**Step 9:** Uveitis
- Fluorescein angiography demonstrating multiple pinpoint leakages.

**Step 10:** Ocular Ischemic Syndrome
- Consider vascular issues given the patient's history and angiography findings.

### Reranking Based on All Patient Information and Test Results
1. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR):**
   - Paracentral metamorphopsia, hyperfluorescence on angiography, fits best with detailed history and findings.
   
2. **Open-Angle Glaucoma:**
   - Elevated intraocular pressures on multiple visits, although best-corrected visual acuity is relatively preserved.

3. **Hypertensive Retinopathy:**
   - History of hypertension, though specific retinal changes not described in detail.

4. **Adrenal Gland Disorder Impact:**
   - Hormonal changes impacting vision given history of adrenalectomy.

5. **Diabetic Retinopathy:**
   - Considering obesity, though no direct evidence of diabetes provided.

6. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD):**
   - Gradual onset of blurry vision, but findings can overlap with CSCR for the age group.

7. **Pseudotumor Cerebri:**
   - Elevated intraocular pressure and obesity history might suggest.

8. **Retinal Vein Occlusion:**
   - Angiography findings consistent but less likely than primary differential diagnoses.

9. **Uveitis:**
   - Considered due to angiography findings though other clinical signs of inflammation missing.

10. **Ocular Ischemic Syndrome:**
    - Due to vascular etiological index but lacks fitting of main symptoms and patient background.

By rearranging the differentials based on the clinical picture and the specificity of exams, Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR) stands out as the leading diagnosis closely followed by the others.","['Neurology', 'Neurosurgery', 'Ophthalmology', 'Diabetes and Endocrinology', 'Endocrinology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,47.0,M

A 19-year-old man presented with 4 years of facial numbness and 3 years of progressive dysarthria and dysphagia. Additionally, 18 months prior to presentation, he also developed arm weakness and hand atrophy followed by leg weakness 1 year later. On examination, dysarthria, bilateral peripheral facial paralysis (Figure, A), reduced facial touch and vibration sensitivity in the mandible, temporal muscle atrophy (Figure, B), and poor soft palate motility were observed. Corneal reflexes were bilaterally absent. Deltoid, calf, and distal muscle atrophy (Figure, C) and weakness (right extensor carpi, Medical Research Council [MRC] grade 0; neck flexion, MRC grade 4; proximal muscles, MRC grade 3; other arm distal muscles, MRC grade 2-3; leg distal muscles, MRC grades 2-4) were observed.

### Re-ranking of Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)**
   - Progressive muscle weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, muscle atrophy, reflex abnormalities, and Babinski sign can be seen in ALS.

2. **Progressive Bulbar Palsy**
   - Dysarthria, dysphagia, facial paralysis, and muscle atrophy fit this profile, particularly the involvement of bulbar muscles.

3. **Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease**
   - Progressive limb weakness and muscle atrophy, but less likely due to cranial nerve involvement.

4. **Brainstem Glioma**
   - Can explain the lengthy progression and cranial nerve deficits.

5. **Spinal Muscular Atrophy**
   - Similarity in progressive muscle atrophy and weakness.

6. **Guillain-Barré Syndrome**
   - Usually an acute onset, and not typical for long-term progression.
   
7. **Spinocerebellar Ataxia**
   - Gait abnormalities, but other features do not match well.

8. **Multiple Sclerosis**
   - Chronic, progressive neurological symptoms, although primarily central in nature, the array of PNS symptoms (e.g., muscle atrophy) is less typical.

9. **Peripheral Neuropathy**
   - Fits the limb muscle symptoms, but less likely due to cranial nerve involvement.

10. **Myasthenia Gravis**
    - Progressive bulbar and limb weakness, but fluctuating symptoms and fatigue are hallmark, not progressive atrophy.","['Neurology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia', 'Facial Nerve']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,M

### INPUT:
A woman in her 50s with hypertension who was otherwise in good health presented for new ophthalmologic evaluation in the setting of mild, long-standing blurred vision with slight metamorphopsia in the right eye. She had a history of high myopia (approximately 9 diopters [D] OD; 8 D OS). Examination revealed an otherwise normal left eye with 20/20 best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). The right eye demonstrated a BCVA of 20/25 and normal anterior segment, including lenticular examination. Dilated fundus examination showed wrinkling of the neurosensory retina at the fovea (Figure 1A) without posterior vitreous detachment. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography revealed hyperreflective layering on the foveal surface consistent with epiretinal membrane, as well as splitting of the outer plexiform layer with hyporeflective cavities (Figure 1B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Foveal retinoschisis with epiretinal membrane in the setting of pathologic myopia,"### 10-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Epiretinal Membrane (ERM)** - The appearance of hyperreflective layering on the foveal surface is highly consistent with this diagnosis.
   
2. **Myopic Macular Degeneration** - Given the patient's history of high myopia, this is a reasonable consideration despite the absence of more extensive degenerative changes on examination.

3. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR)** - While typically presenting with a neurosensory detachment, alternative forms could occasionally present diagnostic challenges.

4. **Macular Hole** - Typically would present differently on OCT but could be an early or atypical presentation.

5. **Vitreomacular Traction (VMT)** - The wrinkling of the neurosensory retina and metamorphopsia symptoms could suggest this, even without posterior vitreous detachment.

6. **Retinal Vein Occlusion** - Might be considered due to her hypertension background, though the fundoscopic findings are not classic.

7. **Cystoid Macular Edema (CME)** - Hyporeflective cavities seen on OCT may suggest accommodative CME, typically associated with specific systemic conditions or post-surgical.

8. **Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)** - Generally associated with a history of diabetes which was not noted, can have similar OCT findings.

9. **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)** - Could be a consideration, though less likely given the absence of drusen or neovascular changes.

10. **Macular Telangiectasia (MacTel)** - Rare, but can present with splitting of the retinal layers and might be considered in differential diagnosis.
  
### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Epiretinal Membrane (ERM)** - The hyperreflective layering and clinical presentation make this the most likely diagnosis.
  
2. **Myopic Macular Degeneration** - Common in patients with high myopia, might cause macular changes.
  
3. **Vitreomacular Traction (VMT)** - Less likely without posterior vitreous detachment but still considered.
  
4. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR)** - Given her metamorphopsia and blurred vision, less supported by OCT but considered.
  
5. **Macular Hole** - Fundus and OCT findings are less compatible, but an early stage cannot be completely ruled out.
  
6. **Retinal Vein Occlusion** - Given hypertensive background, but lacks other supporting evidence on fundus or OCT.
  
7. **Cystoid Macular Edema (CME)** - Hyporeflective cavities on OCT could suggest early CME but less consistent overall.
  
8. **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)** - Absence of classic findings on examination makes it less likely.
  
9. **Macular Telangiectasia (MacTel)** - Rare but fits some of the OCT findings; still less likely.
  
10. **Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)** - Unlikely given the absence of diabetes history.

By consolidating and reevaluating all clinical and diagnostic information, the top hypothesis remains „Epiretinal Membrane (ERM)“, with other differentials becoming increasingly less likely based on available data and patient history.","['Ophthalmology', 'Macular Diseases', 'Retinal Disorders']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,50.0,F

### INPUT:
A 28-year-old man with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) presented with a recent bilateral and painless decrease of best-corrected visual acuity to light perception OD and counting fingers OS. Results of a slitlamp examination showed iris neovascularization and posterior subcapsular cataract in the right eye and no anterior segment abnormalities, including no iris neovascularization, in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 60 mm Hg in the right eye and 14 mm Hg in the left eye. The fundus in the right eye (Figure, A) showed a total retinal detachment with hemorrhagic prepapillary fibrosis reaching up to the posterior capsule; the left eye (Figure, B) showed peripapillary tractional retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy, retinal neovascularization, and vitreous hemorrhage. Fluorescein angiography showed extensive retinal capillary and arteriolar nonperfusion and peripapillary neovascularization in both eyes. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Duchenne muscular dystrophy–associated proliferative retinal vasculopathy,"To approach this complex case, let’s go through a differential diagnosis step by step. I will list each differential diagnosis consecutively and follow with a reranking based on the comprehensive patient information and test results. 

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy** - Due to the extensive retinal capillary and arteriolar nonperfusion and neovascularization.
2. **Sickle Cell Retinopathy** - This condition can also cause retinal nonperfusion and neovascularization.
3. **Retinopathy of Prematurity** - Causes retinal detachment and neovascularization, but less likely in an adult.
4. **Eales Disease** - Characterized by retinal vasculitis leading to neovascularization and vitreous hemorrhage.
5. **Ocular Ischemic Syndrome** - Involves severe hypoperfusion of the ocular arteries leading to neovascularization.
6. **Radiation Retinopathy** - Could cause retinal nonperfusion and neovascularization, though not fitting other aspects of the presentation.
7. **Terson Syndrome** - Associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage leading to vitreous hemorrhage and retinal findings.
8. **Vascular Occlusive Diseases (e.g., Central Retinal Vein Occlusion - CRVO)** - Causes extensive retinal nonperfusion and neovascularization.
9. **Coats Disease** - Can result in retinal detachment and neovascularization, typically unilateral though.
10. **Hypertensive Retinopathy** - Though typically more straightforward retinal changes without such extensive neovascularization.

### Reranking Based on Full Information

1. **Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy** - Given the extensive nonperfusion in a relatively young man, this is the most plausible cause.
2. **Sickle Cell Retinopathy** - The patient's age and the bilateral presentation make this a strong second consideration.
3. **Ocular Ischemic Syndrome** - Severe hypoperfusion could explain both neovascular findings and nonperfusion areas.
4. **Eales Disease** - Young adults with neovascularization and vitreous hemorrhage fit this profile.
5. **Vascular Occlusive Diseases (CRVO)** - Retinal vein occlusion could lead to similar findings, though typically one eye is more profoundly affected.
6. **Terson Syndrome** - Due to the hemorrhagic findings, though less likely without neurologic symptoms.
7. **Radiation Retinopathy** - Possible but lacks a history of radiation exposure to the head or eyes.
8. **Coats Disease** - Retinal detachment and neovascularization match, though usually not bilateral or in adults.
9. **Retinopathy of Prematurity** - Less likely considering age and full medical history.
10. **Hypertensive Retinopathy** - The presentation suggests extensive neovascular complications unlikely from hypertension alone.","['Ophthalmology', 'Muscular Dystrophy', 'Neurology', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Retinal Disorders']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his 50s presented with painful palmar and plantar purpura that lasted for 2 months (Figure, A). The lesions first appeared on the volar aspect of the left hand and resolved spontaneously within a few days. However, the purpura soon relapsed on the left plantar area. Oral administration of aspirin and limaprost alfadex was ineffective, and the purpura spread on the palms and feet, followed by onset of left hemiplegia with dysarthria. The patient had no history of arterial or coronary catheterization, hyperlipidemia, hepatitis, nor endocrine neoplasia. The patient’s body temperature and laboratory test results, including inflammatory markers, were slightly elevated. Autoimmune blood tests, including antinuclear antibody, anticardiolipin antibody, and lupus anticoagulant, were not detected. Lentiginosis was not evident. A skin biopsy of the purpura of the left plantar area was conducted (Figure, B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cutaneous embolization of cardiac myxoma,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Systemic Vasculitis (e.g., Polyarteritis Nodosa)** - Given the prolonged purpura and development of systemic symptoms such as hemiplegia.
2. **Infective Endocarditis** - Considering the painful purpura and associated neurological symptoms.
3. **Cryoglobulinemia** - Due to recurrent purpura and potential immune complex deposition.
4. **Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)** - Suspicious given the neurological involvement and purpura without history of infections or systemic conditions.
5. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - Considering the systemic nature of the symptoms and refractory purpura, potentially secondary to an undiagnosed malignancy.
6. **Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS)** - Because hemiplegia and purpura are consistent with thrombotic events, though no antibodies were detected.
7. **Hypersensitivity Vasculitis** - Due to the nature of purpura and cutaneous involvement without systemic inflammatory markers.
8. **Embolic Stroke** - Spontaneous strokes occurring in unusual patient profiles.
9. **Subacute Bacterial Endocarditis** - A potential diagnosis given systemic features without the presence of clear murmurs.
10. **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)** - Because of systemic involvement and a possible underlying cause for clinical presentation.

### Final Reranked Diagnosis:
1. **Systemic Vasculitis (e.g., Polyarteritis Nodosa)** - Most consistent with protracted purpura, neurological involvement, and systemic signs.
2. **Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)** - Matches purpura and neurological presentation; a hematologic emergency.
3. **Cryoglobulinemia** - Fits the recurrence of purpura and inflammatory markers, which could be slightly elevated.
4. **Infective Endocarditis** - Plausible considering painful palmar lesions (Janeway lesions/Osler nodes) and hemiplegia, despite lack of clear infective source.
5. **Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS)** - Despite negative autoimmune tests, thrombotic events present a clinical suspicion.
6. **Subacute Bacterial Endocarditis** - Often subtle presentation with focal neurological signs and systemic involvement.
7. **Hypersensitivity Vasculitis** - Due to rash and escalated cutaneous involvement but less likely given neurological signs.
8. **Embolic Stroke** - Must be differentiated from other host of conditions that could cause spontaneous thromboembolic events.
9. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** - Always needs consideration, but lack of direct evidence points to other more likely diagnoses.
10. **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)** - Less likely given moderate systemic manifestations and no clinical context suggesting precipitating factor.","['Cardiology', 'Dermatology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50.0,M

### INPUT:
A previously healthy woman in her early 70s was referred to our emergency department with exertional dyspnea. She reported recent physical and emotional stress from work and dizziness 2 days prior to presentation. She denied fever or palpitations. Her blood pressure was 84/59 mm Hg. A harmonic, musical systolic murmur was heard at the left third intercostal space. An electrocardiogram (ECG; Figure 1A) showed diffuse ST-segment elevation, most prominently in the anterior precordial leads. Laboratory evaluation revealed elevated levels of troponin (1.33 ng/mL; normal range: ≤0.016 ng/mL [to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1.0]), brain natriuretic peptide (376.5 pg/mL; normal range: ≤18.4 pg/mL [to convert to nanograms per liter, multiply by 1.0]), creatinine phosphokinase (96 U/L; normal range: 41-153 U/L), and D-dimer (0.68 μg/mL; normal range: ≤1.00 μg/mL [to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 5.476]). Echocardiography showed left ventricular (LV) wall-motion abnormalities involving the mid and apical segments and an LV apical mass with protruding features. Noncontrast computed tomography confirmed the high-density LV mass (Figure 1B). Coronary angiography revealed mild to moderate coronary atherosclerosis without obstructive coronary artery disease. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Takotsubo cardiomyopathy complicated by hypotension secondary to LV outflow tract obstruction and LV thrombus,"Based on the presenting symptoms, clinical findings, and test results, we can generate a differential diagnosis step by step, considering different possibilities one at a time.

1. **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)**
2. **Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy**
3. **Infective Endocarditis**
4. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy**
5. **Thrombus Formation in LV**
6. **Cardiac Tumor**
7. **Pericarditis**
8. **Pulmonary Embolism**
9. **Acute Myocarditis**
10. **Aortic Dissection**

Next, let's think step by step to rerank all these differential diagnoses based on the patient's information and test results:

1. **Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy**
   - The patient shows symptoms typical of stress-induced cardiomyopathy: emotional stress, apical ballooning on echocardiography, and elevated cardiac enzymes without obstructive coronary artery disease.

2. **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)**
   - Diffuse ST-segment elevation and elevated troponin might suggest ACS, however, the angiography did not show obstructive coronary disease, making this less likely than Takotsubo.

3. **Cardiac Tumor**
   - The presence of a high-density LV mass on noncontrast CT could suggest a cardiac tumor, but it is less likely than other diagnoses due to acute presentation and symptoms fitting better with other conditions.

4. **Thrombus Formation in LV**
   - The echocardiography and CT findings raise suspicion for an LV thrombus, which could occur secondary to the observed wall-motion abnormalities.

5. **Infective Endocarditis**
   - Although the patient has a murmur and an LV mass, the absence of fever and normal white blood cell counts make this diagnosis less likely.

6. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy**
   - This diagnosis could account for the systolic murmur and LV motion changes, but typically does not match the acute changes seen in this patient without a more prolonged history.

7. **Acute Myocarditis**
   - Elevated cardiac enzymes and LV abnormalities are consistent with myocarditis, but the absence of recent infection history or classic ECG changes moves it down the list.

8. **Pericarditis**
   - ST-segment elevations could be seen in pericarditis; however, the presence of an LV mass and apical motion abnormalities are not typical.

9. **Pulmonary Embolism**
   - While elevated D-dimer and dyspnea could point towards this, the primary cardiac findings are more consistent with a cardiac etiology.

10. **Aortic Dissection**
   - Blood pressure difference is not noted, and the imaging findings are inconsistent, making this the least likely.

In conclusion, Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy stands as the most likely diagnosis, closely followed by other cardiac-related etiologies.",['Cardiology'],1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,70.0,F

### INPUT:
A 13-year-old boy with an unsteady gait was referred for evaluation. He had been well until 1 month prior, when he developed lower limb weakness after eating a vegetarian diet for 15 days. His medical and family histories were unremarkable. His walking had become unsteady, and he was less talkative. On examination, he scored 24 on a Mini-Mental State Examination, with impairments in temporal and spatial orientation, calculation, and short-term memory. Horizontal nystagmus was observed. His lower limb strength was 4 of 5 proximally and 5− of 5 distally, with increased muscle tone. Patellar reflexes were brisk. Ankle clonus and Babinski signs were present bilaterally. His gait was spastic (Video). Blood test results indicated normocytic anemia (hemoglobin level, 126 g/L; reference, >130 g/L [to convert to grams per deciliter, multiply by 0.1]), borderline folate elevation (2.15 ng/mL; reference, >2 μg/L [to convert nanomoles per liter, multiply by 2.266]), and an increased homocysteine level (8.85 mg/L; reference, <2.03 mg/L [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 7.397]). Results of stool analysis; liver and kidney function tests; myocardial enzyme, electrolyte, ammonia, trace element, and B12 levels; thyroid function, arterial blood gas, antinuclear antibodies, and intrinsic factor antibody tests; and an infection panel test were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging showed mild cerebral atrophy and a hyperintense T2-weighted signal in the cervical spinal cord. Electromyography results were normal. Electroencephalography showed diffuse background slowing with scattered epileptiform discharges. Urine organic acid analysis indicated methylmalonic acidemia.

    ",Cobalamin C deficiency,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Vitamin B12 Deficiency**: Considering the vegetarian diet, neurological symptoms, and increased homocysteine levels.
2. **Folate Deficiency**: Suggested by borderline folate levels and normocytic anemia.
3. **Multiple Sclerosis**: Due to the presence of spastic gait, hyperintense T2 signal in the cervical spinal cord.
4. **Spinocerebellar Ataxia**: Unsteady gait, nystagmus, and spasticity.
5. **Subacute Combined Degeneration**: Due to both spinal cord and cerebral involvement along with neurological deficits.
6. **Adrenomyeloneuropathy**: Given the progression of neurological symptoms and spastic gait.
7. **Methylmalonic Acidemia**: Indicated by the urine organic acid analysis and increased homocysteine.
8. **Friedreich’s Ataxia**: Spastic gait and nystagmus might suggest this hereditary ataxia.
9. **Wilson’s Disease**: Due to the combination of neurologic symptoms and possible mild cerebral atrophy.
10. **Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation**: Spasticity and cognitive impairment could align with this diagnosis.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Vitamin B12 Deficiency**: Strongly indicated by the vegetarian diet, neurological symptoms, normocytic anemia, and increased homocysteine.
2. **Methylmalonic Acidemia**: Confirmed by urine organic acid analysis and aligns with increased homocysteine levels and the vegetarian diet.
3. **Folate Deficiency**: Supported by borderline folate levels and normocytic anemia.
4. **Subacute Combined Degeneration**: Aligns with neurological deficits and imaging findings, potentially connected with Vitamin B12 deficiency.
5. **Multiple Sclerosis**: Less likely but remains in consideration due to cervical spinal cord signal changes and spastic gait.
6. **Spinocerebellar Ataxia**: Matches the ataxia and nystagmus but lacks familial history.
7. **Adrenomyeloneuropathy**: Fits the progressive neurological symptoms and spasticity.
8. **Friedreich’s Ataxia**: Has similar symptoms but generally presents earlier and has a different pattern of findings.
9. **Wilson’s Disease**: Unlikely due to the absence of liver dysfunction and typical Kayser-Fleischer rings.
10. **Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation**: Very rare and less fitting given the patient's presentation and normal iron levels in the blood test.","['Neurology', 'Pediatrics']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,13.0,M

### INPUT:
A 37-year-old man with no history of vision problems presented with subacute loss of vision in his right eye for 1 week. The patient described a paracentral scotoma that progressed to involve central fixation over the course of 3 days. Two weeks earlier, the patient and his children had developed malaise, low-grade fever, and a rash. He worked in the armed services and denied foreign travel, tick bites, or recent immunization. The patient had been evaluated by his primary care clinician and was referred to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/70 OD and 20/20 OS. Test results of intraocular pressures, ocular motility, and pupillary reactions were normal. Confrontation visual fields showed inferonasal and central defects in the right eye. External examination revealed a macular rash of the scalp and all 4 extremities, including the soles and palms (Figure 1A). Anterior segment examination was normal. Posterior segment examination revealed irregular, gray-white pigmentation of the temporal macula of the right eye without vitritis, optic nerve edema, or vasculitis (Figure 1B). Ocular coherence tomography (OCT) revealed focal, heterogenous disruption of the inner segment ellipsoid zone without neurosensory detachment. Fluorescein angiography showed late staining at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) superotemporal to the fovea. Findings from a dilated fundus examination were normal in the left eye.

9. **Cat Scratch Disease (Bartonella henselae)**
10. **Lyme Disease**

### Reranking with All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Acute Posterior Multifocal Placoid Pigment Epitheliopathy (APMPPE)**: Fits the subacute vision loss, macular involvement, and absence of inflammation in other structures. The systemic symptoms align with this diagnosis.
2. **Toxoplasmosis**: Often presents with focal chorioretinitis but less consistent with systemic rash, and unilateral focal macular lesion without vitritis is less typical.
3. **Syphilitic Uveitis**: Has rash and ocular manifestations but typically includes more anterior segment inflammation.
4. **Cat Scratch Disease (Bartonella henselae)**: Less commonly involves macular scotoma and would usually present with neuroretinitis rather than isolated macular lesion.
5. **Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) Retinitis**: Retinal whitening and presence of rash might point here, but typically associated with more inflammation.
6. **Sarcoidosis**: Can cause posterior uveitis but the clinical picture with acute systemic symptoms and rash fits less well.
7. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Retinitis**: Typically presents with more acute, severe inflammation and pain, not matching this milder presentation.
8. **Behçet’s Disease**: Can cause retinal inflammatory lesions but would often present with oral/genital ulcers and recurrent systemic symptoms.
9. **Multiple Sclerosis-related Optic Neuritis**: MS-related optic neuritis typically presents with pain and no associated rash or systemic symptoms.
10. **Lyme Disease**: The lack of tick exposure and travel history makes Lyme disease less likely.","['Infectious Diseases', 'Ophthalmology', 'Dermatology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,37.0,M

### INPUT:
A 34-year-old woman presented with photophobia in both eyes. Six months earlier while abroad, the patient had bilateral cosmetic iris implants (BrightOcular) placed. The patient had a mild change in refractive error postoperatively and was offered laser in situ keratomileusis surgery for correction. She did not report any other immediate postoperative complications. For 4 weeks before presentation, she had blurred vision of the right eye. Her visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 31 mm Hg in the right eye and 17 mm Hg in the left. The pupillary reflex could not be visualized secondary to the iris implants. Slitlamp examination revealed trace anterior chamber cell bilaterally with pigmented keratic precipitates. The implants were overlying the iris structures (Figure 1A). Results of an ultrasonographic biomicroscopy are shown in Figure 1B. Posterior examination was limited by the iris implants, but the optic nerve did not reveal edema or hemorrhages. The peripheral retina could not be visualized in either eye. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Uveitis-glaucoma-hyphema syndrome secondary to cosmetic iris implants,"### Step 1: Glaucoma
Given the elevated intraocular pressure (31 mm Hg in the right eye), glaucoma could be a significant concern, which is consistent with both the elevated IOP readings and the blurred vision in the right eye.

### Step 2: Anterior Uveitis
The presence of trace anterior chamber cell bilaterally and pigmented keratic precipitates suggests inflammation within the anterior chamber, indicative of anterior uveitis.

### Step 3: Implant-Associated Inflammation
The patient's history of cosmetic iris implants and the presence of bilateral inflammation raise the possibility of an inflammatory response triggered by the implants.

### Step 4: Pigment Dispersion Syndrome
Pigment dispersion from the iris implants could cause elevated IOP and visual disturbances due to deposition of pigment.

### Step 5: Chronic Angle-Closure Glaucoma
Given the elevated IOP and possible anatomical changes induced by the iris implants, chronic angle-closure glaucoma should be considered.

### Step 6: Secondary Glaucoma due to Iris Implants
The cosmetic iris implants might cause secondary glaucoma, as they may alter the aqueous humor dynamics.

### Step 7: Keratoconjunctivitis
The complaint of photophobia and blurred vision could be due to keratoconjunctivitis, particularly if there's chronic irritation due to the implants.

### Step 8: Postoperative Infection
Postoperative infection must be considered given the history of recent eye surgery and the ongoing symptoms.

### Step 9: Corneal Edema
Raised IOP could lead to corneal edema, explaining blurred vision and photophobia.

### Step 10: Toxic Anterior Segmentation Syndrome
This rare syndrome can develop postoperatively and manifest with anterior chamber cells and photophobia. 

### Reranking Based on All Patient Information and Test Results:
1. **Secondary Glaucoma due to Iris Implants**: Elevated IOP, blurred vision, history of cosmetic implants.
2. **Implant-Associated Inflammation**: Bilateral inflammation, history of implants.
3. **Pigment Dispersion Syndrome**: Pigment deposits and keratic precipitates.
4. **Anterior Uveitis**: Anterior chamber cells, photophobia.
5. **Chronic Angle-Closure Glaucoma**: Persistent elevated IOP, potential anatomical changes.
6. **Glaucoma**: Primary or secondary conditions leading to high IOP.
7. **Corneal Edema**: Result of elevated IOP leading to blurred vision.
8. **Toxic Anterior Segmentation Syndrome**: Postoperative complication with anterior chamber cells.
9. **Postoperative Infection**: Risk following recent eye surgery, although less likely given the delayed timecourse.

### INPUT:
A White woman in her late 50s with a medical history of osteoporosis, hyperlipidemia, and migraines presented with hematuria. Results of computed tomography (CT) imaging showed an 8×6×5-cm right kidney lesion (Figure 1, A). The patient underwent surgical resection with a right nephrectomy and an apparent diagnosis of angiomyolipoma (AML). One year later, the patient underwent excision of a right iliac wing lesion, and pathologic findings demonstrated xanthoma of bone with sclerosis. Three years after this second surgery, she presented with new abdominal pain. Results of CT imaging revealed a 4.3-cm retrocaval mass at the level of the renal right vein. She underwent surgical resection, and results of pathologic evaluation were consistent with the original tumor. Follow-up CT imaging revealed a 1.2-cm left upper lobe lung nodule and a 0.8-cm right upper lobe lung nodule, as well as a pulmonary embolism and a left 6th rib fracture. These lesions were fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography avid. The patient denied constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, fever, chills, and night sweats. She underwent bilateral video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery wedge resections of the lung lesions, which were also consistent with the primary tumor. Five years later, the patient (now in her late 60s) presented with multiple left pleural-based lung lesions (Figure 1, B). Results of all laboratory testing were within reference ranges. These pleural-based lesions were resected with left video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery partial pleurectomy, and results of pathologic evaluation were positive for HMB45 and Melan-A. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Epithelioid angiomyolipoma,"Let's approach the differential diagnosis step by step, considering the patient’s history, imaging findings, pathologic results, and the clinical course:

1. **Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)** - Initial presentation with a kidney lesion and subsequent distant metastases is suggestive of RCC.
2. **Angiomyolipoma (AML)** - The initial diagnosis post-nephrectomy.
3. **Metastatic Melanoma** - Diffuse metastases to lungs and bone with positive HMB-45 and Melan-A.
4. **Sarcoma** - Given the recurrent soft tissue masses and bone involvement.
5. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)** - Although a secondary condition, it complicates the clinical picture.
6. **Multiple Myeloma** - Given the bone lesion (xanthoma) and recurrent systemic issues.
7. **Chondrosarcoma** - Given the bone involvement and recurrent lesions.
8. **Metastatic Carcinoid Tumor** - Given the recurrent pulmonary nodules with metastasis.
9. **Lymphoma** - Although less likely given lack of constitutional symptoms, can present with systemic lesions.
10. **Metastatic Breast Cancer** - Considering her age and the recurrent nature of lytic bone and lung lesions.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis
Now, reranking based on all the provided information (including pathology consistent with the primary tumor and positive HMB-45 and Melan-A):

1. **Metastatic Melanoma** - Positive for HMB45 and Melan-A.
2. **Angiomyolipoma (AML)** - Initially diagnosed but metastatic melanoma is more consistent with HMB45 and Melan-A.
3. **Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)** - Given the initial kidney mass, but less likely due to later pathological findings.
4. **Sarcoma** - Due to recurrent soft tissue tumors and bone involvement.
5. **Chondrosarcoma** - Recurrent bone and soft tissue involvement.
6. **Multiple Myeloma** - Bone lesions but less consistent with HMB45 and Melan-A positivity.
7. **Metastatic Carcinoid Tumor** - Consider potential of pulmonary involvement.
8. **Lymphoma** - Consider systemic lesion spread but unlikely given pathology.
9. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)** - A secondary complication.
10. **Metastatic Breast Cancer** - Less likely due to the presence of HMB45 and Melan-A positive lesions.

In summary, Metastatic Melanoma now is the most likely diagnosis considering the specific HMB45 and Melan-A immunohistochemistry results.","['Nephrology', 'Urology', 'Urologic Cancer', 'Oncology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,58.0,F

### INPUT:
A woman in her 70s was referred to our centralized heart failure management program because of New York Heart Association functional class III heart failure with preserved left ventricular systolic function and recurrent hospitalizations for heart failure. Her medical history was remarkable for coronary artery disease after coronary artery bypass grafting, chronic stable angina, severe tricuspid regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, and obesity with a body mass index of 39 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). After screening and medication optimization, she underwent successful implantation of a small sensor-pressure device (CardioMEMS; Abbott) into her pulmonary artery without complication. Her home medications included torsemide, metolazone, metoprolol succinate, spironolactone, isosorbide mononitrate, diltiazem, and ranolazine. Her initial postimplantation sensor readings and waveforms are shown in Figure 1A. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Migration of CardioMEMS sensor,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis

1. **Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)** - The patient has New York Heart Association functional class III heart failure with preserved left ventricular systolic function.

2. **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)** - The patient's history includes coronary artery disease, previously treated with coronary artery bypass grafting.

3. **Atrial Fibrillation** - The patient has a known history of atrial fibrillation.

4. **Severe Tricuspid Regurgitation** - The patient is noted to have severe tricuspid regurgitation, contributing to her recurrent heart failure.

5. **Chronic Stable Angina** - The patient's history includes chronic stable angina.

6. **Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)** - Given the patient's obesity with a BMI of 39, she might be at risk for obstructive sleep apnea, exacerbating heart failure symptoms.

7. **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** - Given the chronic use of diuretics (torsemide and metolazone), there may be underlying chronic kidney disease contributing to fluid overload and heart failure.

8. **Medication-Induced Edema** - Medications such as diltiazem or spironolactone can sometimes cause peripheral edema, complicating heart failure management.

9. **Pulmonary Hypertension** - Treated with pulmonary artery pressure sensor implantation, the patient likely has or is at risk for pulmonary hypertension.

10. **Decompensated Heart Failure** - Frequent hospitalizations and functional class III heart failure indicate a possible current state of decompensation.

### Refined Differential Diagnosis Order

1. **Decompensated Heart Failure** - Considering recurrent hospitalizations and the severity of symptoms, this is a leading concern requiring immediate attention.
  
2. **Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)** - Persistent symptoms despite preserved LV function align with HFpEF, common in elderly patients with comorbidities.

3. **Severe Tricuspid Regurgitation** - Significant tricuspid regurgitation can significantly worsen heart failure symptoms.

4. **Pulmonary Hypertension** - Warranting consideration given the use of a CardioMEMS device indicating monitoring for elevated pulmonary pressures.

5. **Atrial Fibrillation** - An ongoing condition that can exacerbate heart failure symptoms, particularly if poorly controlled.

6. **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)** - A contributor to the heart failure burden, especially given the history of bypass grafting and the risk of recurrent ischemia.

7. **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** - Renal dysfunction could be contributing to difficulties in managing fluid status in this patient.

8. **Medication-Induced Edema** - Possible influence from heart failure medications contributing to symptoms of fluid overload.

9. **Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)** - Given her obesity, OSA could be exacerbating her heart failure symptoms if not adequately treated.

10. **Chronic Stable Angina** - While significant, stable angina is a less immediate concern compared to acute or unstable processes.","['Medical Devices and Equipment', 'Cardiology', 'Heart Failure']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,70.0,F

### INPUT:
A 42-year-old woman (height, 160 cm; weight, 50 kg) presented with a 3-month history of a clicking sensation and painful swallowing, mainly on the right side, with a sudden onset. She had consulted other physicians, but the cause could not be identified. The symptoms gradually exacerbated, seriously deteriorating her quality of life and causing a 5-kg weight loss. She also experienced insomnia and depression. Antidepressants and psychotherapy, prescribed under the suspicion of a psychogenic cause, did not alleviate her symptoms. She had no relevant medical history and no smoking or drinking history. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological findings were unremarkable. A careful physical examination, with palpation of the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage region on swallowing, revealed a clear clicking movement and right-sided friction with accompanying pain. However, results of laryngoscopy and other common imaging studies showed no pathology. Hence, to assess the dynamic structural changes during swallowing, we performed swallowing dynamic computed tomography (SD-CT), which can reveal moving structures by creating a dynamic-volume data set during swallowing.1,2 Comparison of the reconstructed SD-CT images at rest (Figure 1A) and on swallowing (Figure 1B) revealed that the superior thyroid notch and the right superior border of the thyroid cartilage contacted the hyoid bone internally during maximum laryngeal elevation on swallowing.

9. **Esophageal Spasm**
10. **Cricopharyngeal Spasm**

### Reasoning:

- **Thyroid Cartilage Syndrome** (Reranked #1): SD-CT imaging showing friction and pain localized to the thyroid cartilage area, corresponding well with the patient's symptomatology.
- **Eagle Syndrome** (Reranked #2): Clicking and painful swallowing can be consistent with elongation of the styloid process, though SD-CT shows clear contact between thyroid cartilage and hyoid bone, focusing suspicion more on the thyroid cartilage.
- **Globus Pharyngeus** (Reranked #3): Common cause of sensation of a lump in the throat but less likely here given the specificity of SD-CT findings.
- **Zenker's Diverticulum** (Reranked #4): Typically presents with dysphagia and regurgitation, but specific dynamic imaging findings narrow it down.
- **Thyroiditis** (Reranked #5): Often presents with pain but typically includes systemic symptoms like fever, not identified here.
- **Temporal Arteritis** (Reranked #6): Unlikely due to lack of systemic inflammatory symptoms and normal neurological findings.
- **Laryngopharyngeal Reflux** (Reranked #7): Can cause throat pain but less likely as the primary cause based on SD-CT findings.
- **Achalasia** (Reranked #8): Symptoms typically include difficulty in swallowing solids and fluids, not as localized to the thyroid cartilage.
- **Esophageal Spasm** (Reranked #9): Less likely due to more typically presenting with chest pain and dysphagia involving the lower esophagus.
- **Cricopharyngeal Spasm** (Reranked #10): Less likely due to specific findings on SD-CT directed towards the thyroid cartilage area.","['Otolaryngology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,42.0,F

1. **Lichen Simplex Chronicus**
   - Based on the pruritic, lichenified nature of the lesions.

2. **Bullous Pemphigoid**
   - Considered due to the presence of occasional tense blisters.

3. **Prurigo Nodularis**
   - Multiple ulcerated papules and nodules suggest this.

4. **Psoriasis**
   - Toenail dystrophy and chronicity of skin lesions are clues.

5. **Dermatitis Herpetiformis**
   - Chronic pruritic condition and blisters might suggest this.

6. **Stasis Dermatitis**
   - Chronic leg lesions can be associated with venous insufficiency.

7. **Contact Dermatitis**
   - Considered if lesions are due to chronic exposure to allergens.

8. **Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita**
   - Familial history and chronic blistering might suggest this.

9. **Nummular Dermatitis**
   - Pruritic, lichenified plaques suggest this possibility.

10. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**
    - Although less common on the legs, chronic blistering considers this.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results
1. **Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita**
   - Histopathologic examination, family history of similar lesions, and tense blisters strongly suggest this diagnosis.

2. **Bullous Pemphigoid**
   - Presence of tense blisters and chronic nature point towards this condition.

3. **Prurigo Nodularis**
   - Chronic, pruritic, ulcerated nodules fit well with this diagnosis.

4. **Lichen Simplex Chronicus**
   - Initial pruritic and lichenified lesions point to this condition.

5. **Psoriasis**
   - Chronic skin lesions and mild toenail dystrophy suggest this.

6. **Dermatitis Herpetiformis**
   - Chronic pruritic blisters, though less likely given historical and histopathologic clues.

A 65-year-old man presented with worsening right eye pain and purulent discharge. He reported being hit in the face by a tree branch several days prior. His medical history was notable for HIV, with a last known CD4 lymphocyte count of 112 cells/mm3 and variable adherence to antiretroviral therapy. At an outside hospital, cultures were obtained, and treatment was initiated with ofloxacin eye drops, 0.3%, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride ointment, 0.3%, and oral moxifloxacin hydrochloride, 400 mg daily. His symptoms worsened, and he was referred 3 days later for further evaluation. On examination, visual acuity in the right eye was hand motions. The left eye examination results were unremarkable. Slitlamp examination was limited by patient discomfort but revealed purulent discharge, a markedly inflamed conjunctiva, diffuse cornea opacification and thinning, and a flat anterior chamber. Given the history of tree branch trauma, the patient was brought to the operating room. Intraoperatively, a 0.5-mm corneal perforation was identified within an area of thinning (Figure, A).

   The initial presentation was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, which could align with bacterial keratitis, especially given the purulent discharge and corneal involvement.

2. **Fungal Keratitis**
   Considering the history of trauma with organic matter (tree branch), fungal keratitis becomes a strong differential.

3. **Acanthamoeba Keratitis**
   Although less common, Acanthamoeba keratitis is severe and linked to trauma and contact with contaminated water or debris.

4. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Keratitis**
   Immunocompromised states like HIV can predispose individuals to HSV keratitis.

5. **Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Keratitis**
   This is a particularly aggressive pathogen in contact lens wearers or trauma cases, causing severe clinical symptoms.

6. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis**
   The patient's HIV status significantly increases the risk for CMV retinitis, known for causing visual impairment in immunocompromised patients.

7. **Mycobacterium Keratitis**
   A less common but possible opportunistic infection in HIV patients causing keratitis or ocular complications.

8. **Nocardia Keratitis**
   Nocardia species can cause ocular infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients.

9. **Ophthalmic Zoster (Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus)**
   Secondary bacterial infections can complicate Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus, specifically in HIV patients.

10. **Candida Keratitis**
   Candida species can cause keratitis, especially in patients with a compromised immune system like HIV.

### Rerank All 10 Differential Diagnoses:

Given the negative cultures and details provided after broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, the context of immunocompromised status, and the trauma history, the reranked differential diagnosis would be:

1. **Fungal Keratitis** 
   - History of trauma involving an organic material (tree branch)
   - Resistant to broad-spectrum antibiotics

2. **Acanthamoeba Keratitis**
   - Resistant to broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - Associated with trauma and severe symptoms

3. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Keratitis**
   - Immunocompromised status (HIV)
   - Persistent symptoms despite antibiotic treatment

4. **Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Keratitis**
   - Aggressive nature, severe symptoms
   - Purulent discharge typical but cultures may not always be positive

5. **Nocardia Keratitis**
   - Resistant to standard antibiotic therapy
   - More common in immunocompromised hosts

6. **Mycobacterium Keratitis**
   - HIV status, and atypical presentation resistant to usual treatments

7. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis**
   - Common in HIV with low CD4 counts
   - Ophthalmic involvement though typically in the retina

8. **Candida Keratitis**
   - Immunocompromised state
   - Resistant to bacterial antibiotics

9. **Ophthalmic Zoster (Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus)**
   - HIV as a risk factor
   - Secondary bacterial infections possible

10. **Bacterial Keratitis**
   - Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, primary initial concern but less likely given the progression

### INPUT:
A 67-year-old woman with fibromyalgia presented with sequential bilateral vision loss. Vision decreased suddenly in the right eye 3 to 4 weeks prior and in the left eye 5 days prior. She reported left-sided scalp tenderness; jaw claudication; neck, shoulder, and low back pain; and a recent 6.8-kilogram weight loss. Visual acuity was 20/200 in the right eye (OD) and hand motion in the left eye (OS). She had a left relative afferent pupillary defect, moderate dry-eye syndrome, and mild cataracts. The right optic nerve had a cup-disc ratio of 0.55 with temporal pallor and mild optic disc edema, and the left nerve had a cup-disc ratio of 0.50 with mild edema without pallor. Bilateral arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy was suspected. Expedited evaluation and treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA) was pursued. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated at 61 mm/h, whereas C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin, and platelet levels were normal. She was hospitalized for empirical treatment with 1 g of intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate daily for 5 days. Results of a left temporal artery biopsy (TAB) were negative for GCA. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits showed abnormal signal and contrast enhancement within the intraorbital midportion of both optic nerves (Figure 1A and B) as well as incidental parotid gland cysts bilaterally (Figure 1C). She was discharged and was taking oral prednisone anhydrous, 60 mg daily. One month later the patient had improvement in visual acuity to 20/50 OD and 20/25 OS. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder associated with Sjögren syndrome,"### Step-by-Step Differential:

1. **Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA)**
   - The patient’s symptoms like jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, and weight loss along with elevated ESR are classic for GCA.

2. **Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION)**
   - Sequential vision loss and age make NAION a consideration, especially with optic disc changes noted.

3. **Sarcoidosis**
   - The optic nerve involvement and bilateral parotid gland cysts could potentially indicate sarcoidosis.

4. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
   - Autoimmune conditions can lead to optic neuropathy and other systemic symptoms.

5. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**
   - Optic neuritis with MRI showing enhancement within the optic nerves could suggest MS.

6. **Behçet’s Disease**
   - This condition can cause vision loss and neurological involvement.

7. **Chronic Relapsing Inflammatory Optic Neuropathy (CRION)**
   - Sudden bilateral vision loss, and MRI findings can be seen in CRION.

8. **Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AION) secondary to diabetes**
   - Diabetic patients are prone to vision loss and optic neuropathy.

9. **Thyroid Eye Disease**
   - Involvement of visual pathways though less common, associated with abnormal thyroid function.

10. **Infiltrative Diseases (e.g., lymphoma)**
    - These can cause vision loss and systemic signs but are less likely given the clinical context.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on Complete Information:

1. **Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA)**
   - Despite a negative biopsy, clinical signs and symptoms support GCA; patients can have clinical GCA without positive TAB. Treatment response supports the diagnosis.

2. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Bilateral parotid gland cysts and optic neuropathy are consistent with sarcoidosis, and the MRI findings support this.

3. **Chronic Relapsing Inflammatory Optic Neuropathy (CRION)**
   - Given the MRI findings and the significant visual improvement with steroids, CRION is a strong consideration.

4. **Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION)**
   - Sequential vision loss in an older patient still aligns with NAION, though some other features are less common.

5. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**
   - Bilateral optic nerve involvement and MRI findings are suspicious for MS, though typical demyelinating lesions are absent.

6. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
   - While SLE can present similarly, the lack of other hallmark systemic features makes it less likely.

7. **Behçet’s Disease**
   - Neurological involvement is a feature, but other classic Behçet’s symptoms are missing.

8. **Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AION) secondary to diabetes**
   - Diabetic status is unknown, making this a less likely cause compared to others.

9. **Thyroid Eye Disease**
   - With no thyroid-related complaints or history, it remains lower on the differential.

10. **Infiltrative Diseases (e.g., lymphoma)**
    - While possible, the patient's clinical and imaging data do not strongly support such a diagnosis at this stage.

### Conclusion:
Given the clinical history, examination findings, imaging, and treatment response, Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) remains the leading diagnosis despite the negative temporal artery biopsy, followed by sarcoidosis and CRION. Further investigations may be warranted to rule out or confirm the less likely conditions.","['Demyelinating Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Neuromyelitis Optica', 'Ophthalmology', 'Rheumatology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,67.0,F

### INPUT:
A 64-year-old woman in excellent general health who was not taking any medications was referred for evaluation of an epiretinal membrane of her right eye. She reported no blurry vision, metamorphopsia, photopsias, floaters, or nyctalopia, and she had no history of refractive surgical procedures, ocular surgical procedures, or trauma. Her family history was negative for ocular conditions, and there was no consanguinity in her family. Her visual acuity was 20/20 OU with correction (plano +0.25 × 153 OD and −0.50 + 0.25 × 009 OS). External and anterior segment examination results were unremarkable except for mild nuclear sclerotic cataracts. Results of a dilated ophthalmoscopic examination showed radial spokelike striae of the fovea, with a central cyst in the right eye and macular edema of the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the right macula showed cystlike changes in the outer retina in the foveal and parafoveal regions and in the inner retina in the temporal macula. Optical coherence tomography imaging of the left macula showed cystlike changes in the outer retina in the inferior macula (Figure). Of note, OCT scans of the optic nerves did not reveal an optic disc pit. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Stellate nonhereditary idiopathic foveomacular retinoschisis,"Let's approach this step by step. Given the patient’s presentation and findings, the following is a process for differential diagnosis:

**Step 1: Macular diseases**

1. **Epiretinal Membrane (ERM)**

**Step 2: Cystic retinal changes**

2. **Cystoid Macular Edema (CME)**

**Step 3: Inherited retinal disorders**

3. **Juxtafoveal Retinal Telangiectasia (MacTel)**

**Step 4: Vascular causes**

4. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)**

**Step 5: Inflammatory causes**

5. **Uveitis**

**Step 6: Metabolic or systemic diseases**

6. **Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)**

**Step 7: Paraneoplastic syndromes**

7. **Cancer-Associated Retinopathy (CAR)**

**Step 8: Degenerative retinal diseases**

8. **Macular Hole**

**Step 9: Medication-induced**

9. **Drug-induced Retinopathy (e.g., from Plaquenil)**

**Step 10: Miscellaneous**

10. **Vitreomacular Traction Syndrome (VMT)**

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Epiretinal Membrane (ERM)** - The primary concern noted at the referral, correlates with the radial striae and cystlike outer retinal changes.
2. **Cystoid Macular Edema (CME)** - The macular edema noted in the left eye and cystlike changes are consistent with CME.
3. **Juxtafoveal Retinal Telangiectasia (MacTel)** - Given the cystic-like changes and absence of common causes like diabetic retinopathy or vein occlusion, this idiopathic condition fits.
4. **Vitreomacular Traction Syndrome (VMT)** - The cystlike changes and absence of an optic disc pit could suggest tractional forces from the vitreous.
5. **Macular Hole** - The radial striae and macular changes could be consistent with early stages of a macular hole.
6. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)** - The macular edema suggests a vascular cause, but absence of hemorrhages or disc swelling makes it lower on the list.
7. **Uveitis** - Inflammatory processes could lead to macular edema, though no inflammatory signs were noted.
8. **Cancer-Associated Retinopathy (CAR)** - Paraneoplastic-related retinopathies can present with diverse retinal changes.
9. **Drug-induced Retinopathy** - Given no medication history, this is less likely but considered for completeness.
10. **Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)** - Without a history of diabetes or systemic conditions, this is unlikely but still a differential for macular edema.

### INPUT:
A 54-year-old woman with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and migraines presented to a tertiary care otolaryngology clinic reporting 3 months of worsening right ear pain and 1 month of pulsatile tinnitus and hearing loss. She denied a history of fever, otorrhea, prior ear infections, vertigo, or otologic surgery. The patient first saw her primary care physician, who visualized a mass in the right ear canal and attempted needle aspiration, which led to self-resolved bleeding. She was given ciprofloxacin ear drops and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, which did not improve her symptoms. On examination, her right external auditory canal (EAC) was completely obstructed by a fleshy, pulsatile mass with a red hue (Figure 1A). Results of Weber tuning fork examination lateralized to the right ear and a Rinne examination suggested a conductive hearing loss. Formal audiogram results confirmed conductive hearing loss in the right ear and type B tympanometry, which was indicative of poor eardrum mobility. Computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone without contrast showed a well-circumscribed 9-mm lesion in the EAC with bony erosion along the junction of the anterior wall and floor (Figure 1, B and C). Magnetic resonance imaging results showed a well-circumscribed, contrast-enhancing mass that was confined to the EAC (Figure 1D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Lobular capillary hemangioma of the EAC,"Certainly, let's develop a differential diagnosis step-by-step, considering the symptoms and test results for this patient.

### Initial Differential Diagnosis
1. **Glomus Tumor (Glomus Tympanicum)**
2. **Cholesteatoma**
3. **Ceruminoma**
4. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**
5. **Adenoma**
6. **Acoustic Neuroma**
7. **Chondrosarcoma**
8. **External Auditory Canal Polyp**
9. **Basal Cell Carcinoma**
10. **Epidermoid Cyst**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis 
1. **Glomus Tumor (Glomus Tympanicum)** - This is the most likely given the pulsatile nature of the mass, the well-circumscribed, contrast-enhancing appearance on MRI, and the conductive hearing loss.
2. **Ceruminoma** - Given the location in the EAC and the presence of a mass, but less likely than glomus tumor due to the pulsatile quality described.
3. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - The bony erosion could suggest malignancy; however, the pulsatile nature of the mass makes this less likely compared to a glomus tumor.
4. **Cholesteatoma** - This could cause bony erosion and conductive hearing loss, but typically presents with chronic otorrhea and would be less pulsatile.
5. **External Auditory Canal Polyp** - This could present as a fleshy mass but is less likely to be pulsatile or cause significant bony erosion.
6. **Adenoma** - A rare benign tumor that could appear in this location, but again, the pulsatile quality makes this less likely.
7. **Chondrosarcoma** - This could erode bone but would be an unusual primary cause in this location.
8. **Acoustic Neuroma** - While it could impact hearing, it is less likely to present with a pulsatile, fleshy mass confined to the EAC.
9. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - A rare cause here, more likely in sun-exposed areas, and less likely to be pulsatile.
10. **Epidermoid Cyst** - Less likely due to the described pulsatile hallmark and the significant bony erosion.

### INPUT:
A 14-month-old boy presented with a sudden-onset, rapidly enlarging lesion in the right eye detected by his parents 2 weeks earlier. The patient had normal tracking bilaterally. Under anesthesia, findings from an examination of the right eye revealed an inferonasal translucent gray-white iris mass with numerous intralesional lacy cystic structures (Figure 1). There was no microphthalmia, cataract, lens subluxation, anterior or posterior synechiae, glaucoma, or uveitis. Findings from a fundus examination were normal. High-resolution anterior segment echography results revealed an iridociliary mass that extended posteriorly to the pars plicata with overall dimensions of 7.7 × 6.0 × 1.9 mm. There were no associated calcifications, retrolental membranes, or seeding. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Iridociliary medulloepithelioma,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Retinoblastoma**: Due to the age of the patient and the presentation of a rapidly enlarging lesion in the eye.
2. **Juvenile Xanthogranuloma**: Common in young children presenting as an ocular mass.
3. **Iris Melanoma**: Rare but possible in pediatric patients, characterized by an enlarging iris mass.
4. **Iris Cyst**: Given the described cystic structures, an iris cyst should be considered.
5. **Persistent Hyperplastic Primary Vitreous (PHPV)**: Often presents with ocular mass but usually associated with other ocular anomalies.
6. **Iris Hemangioma**: Vascular tumors can present as masses with a rapid onset.
7. **Medulloepithelioma**: Rare intraocular tumor that can have cystic structures within.
8. **Metastatic Neuroblastoma**: Can rarely present in the eye, but typically has other systemic signs.
9. **Proliferative Iris Lesion**: Such as a leiomyoma, which can cause an isolated mass in the iris.
10. **Iris Nevus**: Generally does not grow rapidly but worth considering due to the iris location.

### Re-ranked Differential Diagnosis with Additional Information and Test Results

1. **Juvenile Xanthogranuloma**: Given patient age and presentation of an iris mass with cystic structures, this is a strong candidate.
2. **Iris Melanoma**: Important to consider due to the nature of a growing mass despite its rarity in this age group.
3. **Medulloepithelioma**: Fits well with the described intraocular mass and cystic features.
4. **Iris Cyst**: The presence of cystic structures makes this diagnosis relevant.
5. **Retinoblastoma**: Rule out since typically involves retina and associated calcifications are absent.
6. **Iris Hemangioma**: Rapid onset and vascular nature align with patient symptoms.
7. **Persistent Hyperplastic Primary Vitreous (PHPV)**: Less likely given the lack of other characteristic signs.
8. **Proliferative Iris Lesion (e.g., Leiomyoma)**: Less common but a consideration due to isolated mass presentation.
9. **Metastatic Neuroblastoma**: Lack of systemic findings reduces likelihood.
10. **Iris Nevus**: Least likely due to typically slow progression and benign nature.

### INPUT:
A man in his 80s with a history of asthma and bronchiectasis who was receiving immunosuppression therapy presented to an outside hospital with dyspnea and right arm swelling and tenderness 8 days before transfer to our center. The immunosuppression therapy consisted of methylprednisolone, 12 mg every other day, and the patient’s medical history included cerebrovascular accident, atrial flutter, and aortic stenosis. On initial evaluation, his vital signs were stable. On physical examination, the patient had edema of the right arm, hand, and fingers with overlying diffuse violaceous nonblanching and edematous nodules (Figure, A). Purpuric plaques were also noted on the right cheek, central chest, left arm, and left posterior shoulder. Laboratory findings were significant for a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL (reference range 13.5-17.5 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10]). Results of blood cultures from the outside hospital showed “yeast” at the time of transfer. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Disseminated protothecosis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Invasive fungal infection**
2. **Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)**
3. **Bacterial cellulitis**

5. **Lymphangitis**
6. **Vasculitis**
7. **Drug-induced skin reactions**
8. **Hematologic malignancy (e.g., leukemia)**
9. **Chronic venous insufficiency**
10. **Contact dermatitis**

### Reran and Final Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Invasive fungal infection** - Given the patient's history of immunosuppression, the presence of nodules and purpuric plaques, and the positive blood culture for yeast, invasive fungal infection such as Candida or Aspergillus is highly consistent with the clinical picture.
   
2. **Bacterial cellulitis** - Although less likely than a fungal infection due to the yeast culture, bacterial cellulitis remains a consideration given the edematous and tender right arm.

3. **Vasculitis** - Systemic vasculitis could explain the purpuric plaques and diffuse nodules, though the timing and presentation are more indicative of infection.

4. **Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)** - Right arm swelling and tenderness could indicate DVT, although the cutaneous findings and yeast culture point more toward an infection.

5. **Hematologic malignancy (e.g., leukemia)** - The significant anemia (low hemoglobin) and generalized symptoms make this a consideration, although blood culture results make an infection more likely.

6. **Warfarin-induced skin necrosis** - Patients with atrial flutter might be on anticoagulation therapy like warfarin, which can cause skin necrosis, but the yeast culture result directs focus towards infection.

7. **Drug-induced skin reactions** - While the patient is on several medications that could cause skin reactions, the nonblanching nodules and edematous plaques are more suggestive of an infectious etiology.

8. **Chronic venous insufficiency** - Could explain swelling, but the acute presentation and nodules are less typical.

9. **Lymphangitis** - Can cause arm swelling and systemic symptoms but usually presents with red streaks and fever, less so with violaceous nodules.

10. **Contact dermatitis** - Unlikely given the severity, systemic involvement, and yeast findings.

In summary, given the combination of immunosuppression, systemic involvement, and blood culture results showing yeast, an invasive fungal infection is the most likely diagnosis.","['Dermatology', 'Geriatrics', 'Infectious Diseases']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,80.0,M

The patient reported difficulty in performing essential daily tasks, such as driving and walking without assistance. She denied photopsias. Her previous ocular and medical history were unremarkable. She denied any systemic symptoms as well as any family history of inherited ocular diseases. On examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/32 OU. Fundus examination results showed attenuated arterial and venous retinal vessels and slight retinal pigmented epithelium changes at the posterior pole, consisting of atrophy and pigment migration in both eyes, associated with vitreous opacities in the left eye. Fluorescein angiography examination results showed a mild leakage of arterial and venous retinal vasculature (Figure). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography exhibited disruption at the photoreceptor level and multifocal hyperreflective material depositions at the retinal pigmented epithelium level.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

Considering the patient's age, history, progression of symptoms, and detailed examination including fundus findings, fluorescein angiography, and OCT results, the differential diagnoses should be reranked as follows:

1. **Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP)** 
   - Bilateral progressive vision loss, attenuated vessels, pigment changes, and atrophy are hallmark signs.
   
2. **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**
   - Considering the patient's age and atrophic changes, but less likely due to the lack of systemic history and family history.

3. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)**
   - Presents with vascular abnormalities, but less likely without acute symptoms like pain or sudden vision loss.

4. **Birdshot Chorioretinopathy**
   - Bilateral involvement, vitritis, and retinal atrophy can mimic, but usually has more distinctive choroiditis patterns.

5. **Autoimmune Retinopathy**
   - Progressive vision loss and photoreceptor disruption, often presents without systemic symptoms.

6. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Can involve retinal vessel leakage and atrophy but usually has systemic involvements.

7. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease**
   - Can show multifocal hyperreflective lesions but often includes systemic symptoms like meningitis or hearing loss.

8. **Ocular Toxoplasmosis**
   - Vitreous opacities and centring around an old scar suggestive but less likely without inflammatory signs.

9. **Diabetic Retinopathy**
   - Requires a history of diabetes, which this patient lacks.
   
10. **Multiple Evanescent White Dot Syndrome (MEWDS)**
    - Typically has acute symptomatic onset and photopsias, unlike this chronic, progressive presentation.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 30s undergoing peritoneal dialysis for kidney failure who was also being investigated for severe hyperparathyroidism presented with multiple skin lesions 1 day after undergoing cervical computed tomography with iodinated contrast. Physical examination revealed a polymorphous cutaneous eruption characterized by nodular vegetating lesions on the lower lip and right nasal ala (Figure 1A); papulovesicular lesions, either umbilicated or with an erosive center, clustered on the left cheek (Figure 1B); and 2 papulovesicular lesions with an erythematous-to-violaceous halo at the cannula insertion sites on the back of the right hand and the inner side of the wrist. The patient reported that the lesions were painful, with the ones in the oral mucosa impairing feeding. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Iododerma,"To develop a differential diagnosis for this case, we must carefully consider the patient's presentation, medical history, and the sudden onset of symptoms following the use of iodinated contrast. Here's a step-by-step list of differential diagnoses, followed by a reranking based on all information given:

### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Hypersensitivity Vasculitis**
   - The sudden onset of skin lesions following exposure to iodinated contrast suggests a potential allergic or hypersensitivity reaction.

2. **Calciphylaxis**
   - The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and hyperparathyroidism put her at risk for calciphylaxis, which can present with painful skin lesions.

3. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection**
   - Painful lesions, especially those in the oral mucosa, raise the possibility of an HSV infection.

4. **Erythema Multiforme**
   - The presence of polymorphous skin eruptions and recent medication exposure could indicate erythema multiforme.

5. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**
   - Painful nodular and ulcerative lesions could suggest pyoderma gangrenosum, often associated with systemic diseases.

6. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
   - Lupus can present with various skin manifestations and systemic involvement, including renal issues.

7. **Bullous Pemphigoid**
   - Papulovesicular lesions could be indicative of bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune blistering disorder.

8. **Infective Endocarditis**
   - The presence of skin lesions, especially around cannula sites, might suggest septic emboli, often seen in infective endocarditis.

9. **Uremic Pruritus**
   - Patients with ESRD commonly develop uremic pruritus, which can present with various skin changes.

10. **Contact Dermatitis**
    - The localized lesions at the cannula sites may indicate a contact dermatitis reaction.

### Rerank Differential Diagnoses:

Considering the patient’s history, the abrupt onset of symptoms post-iodinated contrast, the polymorphous nature of the lesions, and their distribution, the differential diagnoses are reranked as follows:

1. **Calciphylaxis** - Given her ESRD and hyperparathyroidism history, this remains a top differential.
2. **Hypersensitivity Vasculitis** - The temporal association with iodinated contrast makes this highly likely.
3. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection** - The painful oral lesions fit this differential.
4. **Erythema Multiforme** - The polymorphous presentation is a classic sign of this condition.
5. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum** - Painful nodular and ulcerative lesions lean towards this diagnosis.
6. **Bullous Pemphigoid** - The presence of vesicular and bullous lesions brings this autoimmune disorder into consideration.
7. **Infective Endocarditis** - Especially considering the presence of lesions at cannula sites.
8. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - Although less likely, remains a possibility due to systemic involvement.
9. **Uremic Pruritus** - A common issue in ESRD patients, though the presentation slightly deviates.
10. **Contact Dermatitis** - Possible but less likely given the overall presentation and systemic symptoms.

### INPUT:
A man in his mid-50s with a medical history significant for pulmonary embolism 10 years prior (previously receiving anticoagulation therapy) presented to the emergency department with 10 days of progressively worsening, sharp, nonradiating chest pain. The pain was present at rest, 7 of 10 in severity, and worse with inspiration. He experienced concomitant exertional shortness of breath, dry cough, and lightheadedness. His cardiac history was otherwise unremarkable. Family history was notable for breast cancer in his mother and his sister, but no known inherited hypercoagulable disorders. In the emergency department, his vital signs were as follows: temperature 37.0 °C, blood pressure 130/76 mm Hg, heart rate 97/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Physical examination results were unremarkable, with no cardiac murmurs, rubs, pulmonary crackles, jugular venous distention, or lower extremity edema. Laboratory test results were remarkable for an elevated D-dimer level, an elevated C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a mildly elevated pro-BNP level, but normal levels of troponin and procalcitonin. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of right heart strain, and a computed tomography angiogram of the chest demonstrated an occlusive pulmonary embolism of the left main pulmonary artery and several peripheral consolidations in the left lower lung field consistent with infarction. The patient started anticoagulation therapy with intravenous heparin. A subsequent echocardiogram revealed bowing of the interventricular septum into the left ventricle and a very large (6.6 × 4.1-cm), mobile, nonhomogeneous, pedunculated mass straddling the tricuspid valve and moving between the right atrium and right ventricle (Figure 1 and Video).

    ",Right atrial myxoma with partial myxomatous embolism to the pulmonary artery,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps

1. ____________________: Pulmonary embolism
2. ____________________: Pleural effusion
3. ____________________: Acute coronary syndrome
4. ____________________: Pericarditis
5. ____________________: Right ventricular mass (e.g., myxoma or thrombus)
6. ____________________: Lung infarction
7. ____________________: Cardiomyopathy
8. ____________________: Endocarditis
9. ____________________: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
10. ____________________: Pulmonary hypertension

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. Pulmonary embolism
   - Supported by evidence of an occlusive pulmonary embolism on CT angiogram, history of PE, and elevated D-dimer.
2. Right ventricular mass (e.g., myxoma or thrombus)
   - Echocardiogram revealed a large mobile mass straddling the tricuspid valve compatible with a tumor or thrombus.
3. Lung infarction
   - CT showed peripheral consolidations consistent with infarction; commonly secondary to embolism.
4. Pulmonary hypertension
   - Echocardiogram showed bowing of the interventricular septum into the left ventricle, suggesting right heart pressure overload.
5. Pericarditis
   - Chest pain worsening with inspiration; elevated CRP and ESR can be supportive.
6. Acute coronary syndrome
   - Chest pain and risk factors, although normal troponin reduces likelihood.
7. Pleural effusion
   - Worsening chest pain with inspiration; needs imaging for confirmation.
8. Cardiomyopathy
   - Can cause right heart strain, but less likely given the acute presentation.
9. Endocarditis
   - Mobile mass may suggest a vegetation, especially with a history of IV therapy, but no infection markers like fever or positive blood cultures.
10. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
   - Less likely due to the acute onset and lack of significant smoking history or chronic symptoms.

### INPUT:
A 55-year-old man was referred to the eye clinic for unilateral uveitis and 2 days of sudden vision loss in his right eye. He reported experiencing light sensitivity and mild eye pain. He was in otherwise good health without any chronic medical problems. He reported receiving anticoagulation therapy in the past for a mitral valve problem. His visual acuity was 20/200 OD and 20/20 OS. The examination of the left eye was unremarkable. Slitlamp examination of his right eye revealed 3+ anterior chamber inflammation with vitreous cells. An examination of the dilated fundus showed optic nerve edema with an overlying white infiltrate. In addition, there was inferior retinal whitening consistent with an artery occlusion (Figure 1A). The whitening was attributable to inner retina ischemia, with sparing in the distribution of the cilioretinal artery. An inferior hemicentral retinal artery occlusion was confirmed on intravenous fluorescein angiography (Figure 1B). No embolus was noted at any retinal artery branch points. Notably, a dog bit the patient’s hand 2 months before presentation. Since that time, the patient developed a persistent cough, night sweats, and low-grade fevers that were treated unsuccessfully with 2 courses of oral antibiotics. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Hemicentral retinal artery occlusion secondary to septic embolus,"Based on the presented case, we will develop a differential diagnosis step by step:

### Initial Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Bartonella henselae infection (Cat Scratch Disease)**
   - Reasoning: History of dog bite, systemic symptoms (fever, night sweats), ocular findings consistent with intraocular inflammation, and artery occlusion can be associated.

### 2nd Step:
2. **Toxoplasmosis**
   - Reasoning: Common cause of infectious posterior uveitis; can present with vision loss and retinal involvement.

### 3rd Step:
3. **Syphilitic uveitis**
   - Reasoning: Known cause of severe uveitis with optic nerve involvement; mimics other infections and inflammatory conditions.

### 4th Step:
4. **Herpes zoster ophthalmicus**
   - Reasoning: Typically causes anterior uveitis with potential for retinal complications; history of immune compromise can contribute.

### 5th Step:
5. **Tuberculosis (TB)**
   - Reasoning: History of night sweats, cough, and fever points towards TB which can also have ocular manifestations including uveitis.

### 6th Step:
6. **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**
   - Reasoning: Autoimmune condition with potential for retinal artery occlusion and optic nerve involvement.

### 7th Step:
7. **Multiple sclerosis (MS)**
   - Reasoning: Can present with optic neuritis and has been associated with retinal vascular changes.

### 8th Step:
8. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Reasoning: Granulomatous disease that can cause uveitis and retinal vasculitis; systemic symptoms may also overlap.

### 9th Step:
9. **Behçet’s disease**
   - Reasoning: Multisystem inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent uveitis and retinal vascular involvement.

### 10th Step:
10. **Retinal vasculitis from an autoimmune condition**
    - Reasoning: Broad category for autoimmune conditions presenting with retinal artery occlusion and uveitis.

### Revised Differential Diagnosis Order After Examining All Patient Information and Test Results:
1. **Tuberculosis (TB)**
   - Primed by systemic symptoms like persistent cough, night sweats, fever, which were unsuccessfully treated with antibiotics, and ocular findings.
   
2. **Bartonella henselae infection (Cat Scratch Disease)**
   - Dog bite, systemic symptoms aligning with chronic infection and typical ocular findings.

3. **Syphilitic uveitis**
   - Given the significant ocular findings and systemic nature, syphilis is crucial to rule out.

4. **Toxoplasmosis**
   - Persistent fever and the specific ocular presentation need to be considered.

5. **Herpes zoster ophthalmicus**
   - A past medical history inclusive of immune compromise or varicella-zoster infection could support.

6. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Considering systemic granulomatous disorder possibilities with uveitis.

7. **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**
   - Autoimmune retinal involvement and systemic symptoms prompt investigation.

8. **Behçet’s disease**
   - Should consider due to multisystem inflammation and recurrent uveitis.

9. **Multiple sclerosis (MS)**
   - Possibility of optic neuritis with systemic symptoms that may overlap.

10. **Retinal vasculitis from an autoimmune condition**
    - Broad differential that captures possibilities tied to autoimmune etiology without clear primary condition evidence.

### Conclusion:
While TB is a leading differential based on combining systemic and ocular findings, others must be carefully ruled out with relevant laboratory testing, imaging, and history details.","['Cardiology', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Trauma and Injury', 'Retinal Disorders']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,55.0,M

### INPUT:
A 72-year-old woman with metastatic, well-differentiated, small intestinal neuroendocrine tumor (NET) presented for routine follow-up in September 2020 with worsening fatigue and flushing. She was initially diagnosed with metastatic involvement of the liver, bone, and intra-abdominal lymph nodes in 2015 and received 3 treatments with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in 2017. After 2 years of disease stability she was retreated with PRRT in November 2019 because of radiographic progression of disease and worsening symptoms. A third dose of PRRT was given in March 2020; a fourth was deferred owing to persistent thrombocytopenia after treatment. Gallium 68 dotatate positron emission tomography–computed tomography in July 2020 revealed stable disease (Figure, A). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Neuroendocrine tumor infiltration of bone marrow,"Sure, we can explore a step-by-step differential diagnosis for the patient's worsening fatigue and flushing, while taking into account her medical history and recent treatments.

1. **Recurrence of Neuroendocrine Tumor (NET) Activity**: Given her history and symptoms, recurrence or progression of NET activity should be considered.
2. **Carcinoid Syndrome**: Flushing and fatigue are common symptoms in carcinoid syndrome, which is often associated with NET.
3. **PRRT-related Toxicity**: Persistent thrombocytopenia and other symptoms might indicate delayed or cumulative toxicity from PRRT treatment.
4. **Liver Dysfunction**: Metastatic NET to the liver could cause hepatic insufficiency, resulting in fatigue and systemic symptoms.
5. **Bone Marrow Suppression**: Prolonged thrombocytopenia could be due to bone marrow suppression from treatments or metastasis.
6. **Anemia**: Chronic disease, including metastatic cancer, or treatment-related bone marrow effects could cause anemia, contributing to fatigue.
7. **Heart Failure**: Carcinoid heart disease can lead to symptoms such as fatigue and flushing due to valvular heart damage.
8. **Adrenal Insufficiency**: Chronic illness or long-term treatments could lead to adrenal insufficiency, manifesting as fatigue.
9. **Medication Side Effects**: Various medications for controlling symptoms or associated conditions could have side effects including fatigue and flushing.
10. **Infection**: A chronic or subacute infection, possibly exacerbated by immunosuppression from treatments, could also cause these symptoms.

Re-ranking Based on the Full Patient Information and History:
1. **Carcinoid Syndrome**: Highly probable given the primary diagnosis and regressive symptoms like flushing.
2. **Recurrence of Neuroendocrine Tumor (NET) Activity**: Persistent and worsening symptoms post-treatment indicate this as a significant possibility.
3. **PRRT-related Toxicity**: History of treatments and subsequent drop in platelet counts could point towards cumulative toxicity.
4. **Liver Dysfunction**: Persistent systemic symptoms and known liver metastasis necessitates this evaluation.
5. **Bone Marrow Suppression**: Persistent thrombocytopenia post-treatment is suggestive.
6. **Anemia**: Highly plausible in metastatic cases, another direct cause for fatigue.
7. **Heart Failure**: Carcinoid heart disease can directly cause these symptoms, especially in advanced NET cases.
8. **Adrenal Insufficiency**: The long duration of illness and multiple treatments can lead to adrenal impairment.
9. **Infection**: Immunosuppressive effects of treatments might make infections more likely.
10. **Medication Side Effects**: Lower on the differential list but should be considered as a contributing factor.","['Oncology', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine', 'Hematology']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,72.0,F

### INPUT:
A man in his 60s presented to our dermatology outpatient department with a 5-year history of pruritic papules on the right side of his lower back. He was otherwise healthy, with no family history of a similar condition. Physical examination results showed multiple dome-shaped, skin-colored, firm papules on his right lower back, arranged in a blaschkoid distribution (Figure 1A). The lesions varied in size, with some coalescing into irregular-shaped, larger papules. Telangiectasis could be seen on some of the lesions. A skin biopsy was performed on his back and submitted for further histopathologic analysis (Figure 1B and C). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Mucinous nevus,"Let's approach this step by step and form a differential diagnosis list based on the clinical presentation:

1. **Lichen Planus** - Pruritic, purple papules commonly seen in the elderly populace.
2. **Porokeratosis** - Presents as annular lesions with an atrophic center and a hyperkeratotic border.
3. **Nevus Sebaceous** - Embryonal hamartoma, often presenting in the form of linear streaks or patches.
4. **Epidermal Nevus** - Comprises hyperkeratotic papules or plaques arranged in a linear or Blaschkoid distribution.
5. **Cutaneous Lymphoma** - Lymphoproliferative disorder having papules, plaques, or nodules, commonly presenting later in life.
6. **Seborrheic Keratosis** - Typically appears as benign skin growths in various morphologies.
7. **Lichen Simplex Chronicus** - Chronic dermatitis characterized by pruritic, thickened, lichenified patches.
8. **Prurigo Nodularis** - Characterized by pruritic nodules, often coalescing or linear in pattern due to repetitive scratching.
9. **Macroglobulinemia** - Rare condition, with associated dermal manifestations such as pruritic papules and nodules.
10. **Cutaneous Metastasis** - Secondary malignant lesions that sometimes present as nodules or papules in association with an underlying malignancy.

With these 10 differential diagnoses in consideration, the next step involves re-ranking them based on the additional information from a histopathologic analysis, clinical presentation, and the absence of a similar family history:

1. **Epidermal Nevus** (Given the Blaschkoid distribution, hyperkeratotic papules, and linear pattern).
2. **Cutaneous Lymphoma** (Papules and nodules in elderly patients aligning with some of the histologic findings).
3. **Prurigo Nodularis** (Pruritic nodules presenting in groups, addressing chronic symptomatology).
4. **Lichen Planus** (Presence of pruritic papules, though the linear pattern is less typical).
5. **Porokeratosis** (Dermatosis with unique histological features, considering varied lesion sizes and potential central atrophy).
6. **Macroglobulinemia** (Though a systemic review might provide more clarity, pruritic papules and nodules align).
7. **Cutaneous Metastasis** (Given patient's age, and assuming no primary malignancy identified yet).
8. **Lichen Simplex Chronicus** (Manifested by pruritic lesions but not predominantly linear as presented).
9. **Nerus Sebaceous** (Though less pruritic and more localized, still following linear patterns).
10. **Seborrheic Keratosis** (Common benign growths but less pruritic and often not linear).

### INPUT:
A 50-year-old woman presented with left eye redness and headaches for 2 months. Results from a previous computed tomographic scan of the head were unremarkable. She denied ocular disease, trauma, or surgery. She had no medical problems aside from chronic back pain due to a herniated disc. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure, extraocular motility, and pupillary examination results were normal. The right eye was unremarkable. Examination of the left eye showed 2 temporal scleral nodules with surrounding hyperemia and no scleromalacia. She experienced substantial pain with palpation. Posterior examination results were unremarkable. The results of the following laboratory tests were all unremarkable: tuberculosis interferon-γ release assay, rapid plasma reagin, fluorescent treponemal antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. The rheumatoid factor level (18 IU/mL [normal range, <14 IU/mL]) and C-reactive protein level (26 mg/L [normal range, 0-5 mg/L]) were elevated. In addition, Lyme IgG, IgM, and reflex Western blot assays were positive for antibodies. The patient denied travel to Lyme-endemic regions, tick bites, or rashes. The patient started oral prednisone therapy for possible rheumatoid arthritis (RA)–associated nodular scleritis, doxycycline therapy for positive Lyme studies, and was referred to a rheumatologist for further RA evaluation. Two weeks after presentation and initiation of oral prednisone therapy, the patient noted improvement in pain, but the scleral nodules and hyperemia persisted. Therefore, subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide (0.5 mL of 40 mg/mL) was administered to the left eye. Further confirmatory RA workup by rheumatology did not reveal other systemic findings thought to be associated with RA on review of symptoms or clinical examination. The patient's back pain was associated with her herniated disc. Subsequently, the patient’s examination results showed new scleral thinning of the left eye with persistence of the scleral nodules (Figure 1).

The patient was in moderate respiratory distress, and chest auscultation revealed bilateral wheezing. They were treated for presumed anaphylaxis with 0.5 mg of epinephrine intramuscularly. Immediately after the administration of epinephrine, they developed a headache, nausea, and chest pain. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained 5 minutes later (Figure 1). The patient had persistent hypotension. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Kounis syndrome (acute coronary vasospasm associated with anaphylactoid response),"1. **Anaphylaxis** - Initial presentation suggests an acute allergic reaction with symptoms such as presyncope, hives, and respiratory distress starting after exposure to cold.
2. **Cold Urticaria** - A specific type of physical urticaria that could explain hives and symptoms triggered by cold exposure.
3. **Asthma Exacerbation** - Bilateral wheezing could be related to an asthma attack, possibly triggered by cold air or allergens.
4. **Vasovagal Syncope** - Presyncope with hypotension and bradycardia could be due to a reflex syncope triggered by environmental stress.
5. **Cardiogenic Shock** - Persistent hypotension and chest pain after epinephrine administration might suggest a cardiac issue, potentially a cardiogenic shock.
6. **Adrenal Insufficiency** - Symptoms like hypotension, nausea, and malaise can be connected to an adrenal crisis, which might be brought on by stress.
7. **Sepsis** - Persistent hypotension and respiratory distress might indicate a severe systemic infection.
8. **Pulmonary Embolism** - The sudden onset of severe chest pain and respiratory distress could be from a PE, although initial symptoms may focus elsewhere.
9. **Pneumothorax** - Acute respiratory distress with hypotension and chest pain post-treatment might suggest a pneumothorax.
10. **Myocardial Infarction** - The patient’s symptoms post-epinephrine administration (chest pain and headache) warrant consideration for an acute coronary syndrome.

1. **Anaphylaxis** - Based on initial presentation (hives, respiratory distress, rapid onset symptoms). Treated appropriately with epinephrine.
2. **Cold Urticaria** - Strong correlation with symptoms after cold exposure. 
3. **Asthma Exacerbation** - Bilateral wheezing suggests airflow limitation consistent with asthma.
4. **Myocardial Infarction** - Chest pain post-epinephrine raises concern for coronary event, especially with persistent hypotension.
5. **Pneumothorax** - Chest pain and ongoing respiratory distress post-intervention suggest possible lung collapse.
6. **Pulmonary Embolism** - Persistent respiratory symptoms and hypotension could indicate a PE, though less likely with clear initial history.
7. **Cardiogenic Shock** - Persisting hypotension with potential cardiac history concern post-epinephrine.
8. **Vasovagal Syncope** - Initial hypotension and potential bradycardia fit but less likely following persistent symptoms.
9. **Sepsis** - Possible, but other symptoms and acute onset more indicative of allergic/immediate response.

### INPUT:
A 73-year-old man was referred to our service for assessment of a slow-growing conjunctival lesion in the left eye. He had first noticed left eye discomfort and a fullness of the left lower eyelid 3 months previously. He denied any vision or systemic symptoms. His ophthalmic history was noncontributory. The patient’s medical history was notable only for prostate carcinoma, which was treated with radiotherapy 12 years ago. On examination, his visual acuities were 20/25 OU. Slitlamp examination of the anterior segment revealed diffuse yellow-pink polypoidal papules affecting the inferior fornix and inferior palpebral conjunctiva of the left eye (Figure 1A). The upper palpebral conjunctiva in the left eye had a velvety yellow appearance (Figure 1B). The remainder of the examination of both eyes was unremarkable. Initial investigations, including a complete blood cell count, urinalysis, and measurement of inflammatory markers, kidney function, and prostate-specific antigen level, were within normal limits. Serum electrophoresis showed raised monoclonal IgM bands (7.25 g/L; reference range, 0.50-2.00 g/L) with a κ/λ light-chain ratio of 2.92 (reference range, 0.260-1.65). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Conjunctival amyloidosis,"**Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Ocular Adnexal Lymphoma**
   - Reason: Presence of a slow-growing conjunctival lesion with monoclonal IgM bands suggestive of a lymphoproliferative disorder.
  
2. **Conjunctival Amyloidosis**
   - Reason: Diffuse yellow-pink lesions and elevated monoclonal proteins can hint at local amyloid deposits.
  
3. **Sebaceous Gland Carcinoma**
   - Reason: Eyelid tumors, though less common, should be considered in the differential.
  
4. **Chronic Conjunctivitis**
   - Reason: Inflammation might present with polypoidal lesions.
  
5. **Conjunctival Squamous Cell Carcinoma**
   - Reason: Slow-growing conjunctival masses in older patients can represent malignancies like squamous cell carcinoma.
  
6. **MALT Lymphoma**
   - Reason: Also characteristic of insidious conjunctival growths and associated with monoclonal gammopathies.

7. **Mantle Cell Lymphoma**
   - Reason: Elevated monoclonal bands might point toward other hematologic malignancies.

8. **Multiple Myeloma**
   - Reason: Presence of monoclonal proteins; albeit less likely due to localized eye presentation.
  
9. **Plasmacytoma**
   - Reason: Isolated, slow-growing tumors in the context of monoclonal gammopathy.
  
10. **Benign Reactive Follicular Hyperplasia**
    - Reason: Can sometimes present similarly with benign swollen lymphoid tissues.

### Ranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Information:

1. **Ocular Adnexal Lymphoma**
   - Comprehensive fit with clinical presentation and monoclonal IgM bands.
  
2. **MALT Lymphoma**
   - Particularly linked with ocular manifestations and monoclonal gammopathies.
  
3. **Conjunctival Amyloidosis**
   - Presence of localized deposits supported by raised monoclonal proteins.

4. **Plasmacytoma**
   - Localized lesion correlating with a paraproteinemia.

5. **Mantle Cell Lymphoma**
   - Less common, but possible in conjunction with the gammopathy.
  
6. **Sebaceous Gland Carcinoma**
   - Due to presentation and history, although systemic signs are absent.
  
7. **Conjunctival Squamous Cell Carcinoma**
   - Malignant growth in an older patient fits, but less correlation with monoclonal increase.
  
8. **Multiple Myeloma**
   - Systemic involvement seems less likely here, but monoclonal proteins remain noteworthy.

9. **Chronic Conjunctivitis**
   - Inflammation could be a differential, but systemic signs and lab findings don’t support it strongly.

10. **Benign Reactive Follicular Hyperplasia**
    - Benign nature of lesions presenting less likely given the monoclonal gammopathy.

### INPUT:
An 89-year-old asymptomatic woman presented to a new eye care professional for a routine examination. Examination findings showed a large choroidal mass in the left eye suspicious for a malignant neoplasm. The patient’s ocular history showed a cataract surgical procedure, YAG capsulotomy, and subsequent repair of retinal detachment with scleral buckle and pneumatic retinopexy in the left eye approximately 30 years earlier. Ophthalmoscopic examination results of the left eye revealed a peripheral retinal atrophy from previous cryotherapy treatment. A large choroidal mass was observed in the inferotemporal region. The patient was referred for further evaluation of the mass, which was suspected to represent choroidal melanoma. Our examination findings showed a visual acuity of 20/20 OD and 20/60 OS, with intraocular pressures of 20 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS measured using a tonometer (Tono-pen; Reichert Inc). Ophthalmoscopy results of the right eye were normal. In the left eye, a 360° encircling band with overlying retinal atrophy was documented. There was a variably pigmented, abruptly elevated mass deep in the inferotemporal retina, measuring 12.0 mm in diameter (Figure, A) and without overlying drusen, orange pigment, or subretinal fluid. Ultrasonography results showed that the mass was dome shaped and echodense, with posterior shadowing (Figure, B); it measured 4.6 mm thick. Optical coherence tomographic imaging revealed an intact macula. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Choroidal pseudomelanoma secondary to scleral buckle,"To establish a differential diagnosis for the large choroidal mass observed in the left eye of this 89-year-old asymptomatic woman, we need to systematically consider a range of possible conditions. Here's a step-by-step approach:

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Choroidal Melanoma**
   - Commonly suspected for choroidal masses, particularly with abrupt elevation and pigmentation.

2. **Choroidal Hemangioma**
   - Often presents as an elevated, echodense mass; typical features on ultrasonography.

3. **Metastatic Cancer to the Choroid**
   - Metastasis from other primary cancers like lung or breast could appear as choroidal masses.

4. **Choroidal Nevus**
   - A generally benign pigmented lesion that can occasionally be confused with melanoma.

5. **Choroidal Osteoma**
   - Characterized by calcification and generally appears echogenic with posterior shadowing on ultrasonography.

6. **Lymphoma**
   - Intraocular lymphoma can present as choroidal masses, though generally associated with systemic symptoms.

7. **Hemorrhagic Choroidal Detachment**
   - Results from trauma or surgery history, presenting as dome-shaped mass with shadowing.

8. **Choroidal Granuloma**
   - Associated with systemic inflammatory or infectious diseases, such as sarcoidosis or tuberculosis.

9. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (Wet AMD)**
   - Though typically not presenting as a large discrete mass, can sometimes cause choroidal elevations.

10. **Sclerochoroidal Calcification**
    - Causes an elevated, calcified mass often seen in elderly patients; can match the description on multiple imaging modalities.

### Reranking Based on All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Choroidal Melanoma**
   - Due to the size, variegated pigmentation, and abrupt elevation, along with the absence of features like drusen or orange pigment.
   
2. **Choroidal Hemangioma**
   - Fits the echodense and dome-shaped description with posterior shadowing on ultrasonography.
   
3. **Choroidal Osteoma**
   - Considered due to the echodense nature and posterior shadowing but less likely due to atypical clinical presentation.
   
4. **Metastatic Cancer to the Choroid**
   - Possible given her age and considerable past ocular history, warrant further systemic evaluation for primary malignancy.
   
5. **Choroidal Nevus**
   - Less likely given the size and sudden elevation described.
   
6. **Choroidal Granuloma**
   - Needs to be considered if there's a systemic inflammatory or infectious history, though not primary given her asymptomatic status.
   
7. **Lymphoma**
   - Unlikely without systemic involvement and given this presentation; typically would have additional ocular signs.
   
8. **Sclerochoroidal Calcification**
   - Rare, but fits the echodense mass with posterior shadowing, although less likely given patient description and absence of calcification signs.
   
9. **Hemorrhagic Choroidal Detachment**
   - Previous ocular surgeries increase probability, but doesn’t exactly fit the description of being an abruptly elevated, variably pigmented mass.
   
10. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (Wet AMD)**
    - Least likely due to absence of drusen or subretinal fluid and different presentation of the choroidal mass.

Conclusively, choroidal melanoma remains the top differential, supported by clinical and imaging findings that align well with classical manifestations of this condition.","['Retinal Disorders', 'Ophthalmology', 'Geriatrics', 'Ophthalmic Imaging', 'Choroidal Disorders']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,89.0,F

### INPUT:
A 39-year-old female patient with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and bone metastases presented in April 2020 with lower back pain, which was aggravated while standing and walking. She reported no known trauma, and no motor or sensory deficits were noted during clinical examination. She had no fever. After the initial sarcoma diagnosis in September 2018, the patient received 8 cycles of doxorubicin hydrochloride and ifosfamide along with regional hyperthermia, followed by good tumor response. The patient had a history of a pathological fracture of L4, which had been treated with radiotherapy and vertebroplasty in November 2019 and remained unchanged on imaging obtained in April 2020. The treatment regimen recently had been switched to gemcitabine hydrochloride and docetaxel in January 2020 following osseous progression during maintenance chemotherapy with trofosfamide, idarubicin hydrochloride, and etoposide. On restaging computed tomography, symmetrical enlargement of both psoas muscles was observed with intramuscular hypodensity (Figure, A). The patient reported lower back pain but no motor or sensory deficits. Further workup with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed extensive, nearly symmetrical swelling in both psoas muscles and sharply delineated, peripheral contrast enhancement of the fascia with strict horizontal bounds (Figure, B and C). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Radiation recall myositis,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma Progression**: Given the patient's history of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, disease progression could cause new or worsening symptoms.
  
2. **MRI Imaging**: The imaging findings with symmetrical enlargement of both psoas muscles and intramuscular hypodensity could be indicative of a secondary condition such as **Psoas Muscle Abscess**.

3. **Previous Treatments**: Consideration of treatment side effects, particularly with chemotherapeutic agents. Could this be an issue related to **Chemotherapy-Induced Myopathy**?

4. **Radiotherapy**: Given past radiotherapy for a pathological fracture, radiation-induced changes are possible. **Radiation Myositis** could present with muscle swelling.

5. **New Malignancy**: While less likely given the focus on existing rhabdomyosarcoma and metastases, a second primary malignancy, such as a **Lymphoma**, could potentially involve the psoas muscles.

6. **Bacterial Infection**: No fever is noted, but infections don’t always present typically, especially in immunocompromised patients. Consider **Pyomyositis** of the psoas muscles.

7. **Autoimmune Condition**: Some autoimmune myopathies can present suddenly and severely. **Polymyositis** should be considered despite the lack of systemic symptoms.

8. **Drug-Induced**: Apart from myopathy, some drugs can cause direct muscle injury. **Statin-Induced Myopathy** can cause similar muscle changes, though it's less likely in this context.

9. **Retroperitoneal Hemorrhage**: Although no trauma is known, consider **Spontaneous Retroperitoneal Hemorrhage**, especially given the patient’s medical history and medication profile.

10. **Metabolic Condition**: Rarer, but it could be **Rhabdomyolysis** related to muscle damage from all treatments, though generally it would be more diffuse.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Psoas Muscle Abscess**: Given the imaging findings and patient’s immunocompromised status, infection is significant.
2. **Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma Progression**: Considering primary disease, metastasis and local invasion need priority ruling out.
3. **Pyomyositis**: Similar reasoning as the abscess, infectious in nature but more generalized muscle infection.
4. **Radiation Myositis**: Prior radiation therapy to the spinal region could be causing muscle changes.
5. **Chemotherapy-Induced Myopathy**: Potential effects of multiple chemotherapy regimens need consideration.
6. **Polymyositis**: Autoimmune disorders can cause such muscle inflammation, though lack of systemic symptoms makes it less likely.
7. **Spontaneous Retroperitoneal Hemorrhage**: No trauma history, still possible due to medical and medication profile.
8. **Second Primary Malignancy (Lymphoma)**: Less common but needs ruling out given the muscle enlargement.
9. **Rhabdomyolysis**: Due to extensive treatments, mild possibilities exist here.
10. **Statin-Induced Myopathy**: Unlikely in this context, but still on the differential list for muscle changes.

### INPUT:
A patient in their late 70s with a history of Crohn disease, coronary artery disease, hypercholesterolemia, and transient ischemic attack presented with sudden, painless, left-sided vision loss. They denied headache, scalp tenderness, and jaw claudication. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 103 mm/h and a magnetic resonance angiographic examination of the brain was negative for mass, infarction, and hemorrhage. Examination results of a right, superficial, temporal artery biopsy specimen showed chronic, nongranulomatous inflammation surrounding adventitial vessels and extensive subintimal fibrosis, without giant cells or segmental loss of the internal elastic lamina, which was interpreted as compatible with temporal arteritis. High-dose corticosteroid therapy was initiated (1 g methylprednisolone intravenously for 3 days followed by 60 mg/d of oral prednisone). A neuro-ophthalmologic examination performed 1 week later showed an unreactive left pupil with an obvious relative afferent pupillary defect. Optic nerve pallor concomitant with edema and a single flame-shaped hemorrhage at the 4-o’clock position on the disc margin was also observed. Two weeks later, persistent elevation of the ESR and C-reactive protein levels, despite continued oral prednisone therapy, prompted a review of the temporal artery biopsy findings. This disclosed abundant transmural deposits of amorphous eosinophilic acellular material that was congophilic and exhibited apple-green birefringence under polarized light, consistent with amyloid deposits (Figure). Immunohistochemical staining showed IgM and λ light chain restriction.

1. **Primary Amyloidosis**
   - Finding: Transmural deposits of amorphous eosinophilic acellular material, congophilic, apple-green birefringence, Immunohistochemical staining showed IgM and λ light chain restriction.
2. **Temporal Arteritis (Giant Cell Arteritis)**
   - Initial diagnosis given the patient's symptoms, ESR results, and biopsy interpreted as compatible.
3. **Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION)**
   - Painless vision loss in an elderly patient with risk factors like hypercholesterolemia.
4. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)**
   - Sudden, painless vision loss; although specific findings don't align perfectly with CRAO.
5. **Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO)**
   - Edema and hemorrhage, but lacks definitive signs like ""blood and thunder"" appearance.
6. **Optic Neuritis**
   - Afferent pupillary defect and optic disc swelling; less likely given age and lack of pain.
7. **Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**
   - Potential due to age but lacks characteristic macular findings.
8. **Diabetic Retinopathy**
   - No history of diabetes or characteristic retinal changes noted.
9. **Toxic Optic Neuropathy**
   - No clear exposure to toxins noted.
10. **Vitreous Hemorrhage**
   - Would expect more extensive hemorrhages or history of trauma.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 30s presented with a chronic history of slowly expanding asymptomatic papules on the dorsal hands since childhood, with more recent involvement of both forearms. She denied photosensitivity, arthritis, or muscle weakness. Examination revealed multiple discrete reddish-brown, well-defined, smooth 2- to 6-mm dome-shaped papules (Figure, A). There were no nail changes or mucous membrane involvement. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Progressive mucinous histiocytosis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Lichen amyloidosis**
   - Considered because of the chronic progression and discrete papules.

2. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Takes into account the reddish-brown coloration and well-defined nature of lesions.

3. **Granuloma annulare**
   - Considers the dome-shaped papules and chronic nature without systemic symptoms.

4. **Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis**
   - We consider it due to the symmetry and involvement of hands and forearms without other systemic involvement.

5. **Xanthoma disseminatum**
   - Despite it being rare, its presentation with multiple papules could fit.

6. **Cutaneous sarcoid**
   - Differs from systemic sarcoidosis, with isolated skin involvement.

7. **Tuberous sclerosis**
   - Considers the onset since childhood and distribution pattern of lesions.

8. **Mastocytosis**
   - Because of its chronicity and multiple lesions, albeit less likely without systemic symptoms.

9. **Lichen planus**
   - Given the well-demarcated nature and chronic history, but usually accompanies itching.

10. **Clear cell acanthoma**
    - Due to the well-defined reddish-brown lesions and lack of systemic symptoms.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis with Full Consideration of Patient Information and Symptoms

1. **Lichen amyloidosis**
   - Fits best with the chronic course, discrete nature, and absence of systemic symptoms.

2. **Granuloma annulare**
   - Considers chronicity and similar lesion characteristics, minus systemic symptoms.

3. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Reddish-brown, well-defined papules align but lack systemic involvement reduces priority.

4. **Cutaneous sarcoid**
   - Isolated skin involvement with similar lesion presentation, though less common.

5. **Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis**
   - May match the chronic, isolated skin symptomatology but less common.

6. **Lichen planus**
   - Characteristic lesions but usually associated with pruritus; lower priority without itching.

7. **Clear cell acanthoma**
   - Lesion characteristics are fitting but is less likely due to typical solitary presentation.

8. **Xanthoma disseminatum**
   - Multiple papules could fit, though systemic involvement makes it less likely.

9. **Mastocytosis**
   - Chronic and multi-lesional but systemic symptoms are usually present.

10. **Tuberous sclerosis**
    - Chronic lesions since childhood, but characteristic systemic findings are absent.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy, middle-aged patient presented with rapidly increasing shortness of breath despite empirical antibiotic treatment for presumed pneumonia. A computed tomographic image of the chest was notable for diffuse, ground-glass opacities. An infectious disease workup was unrevealing, and the patient was diagnosed with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure resulting from dermatomyositis-associated interstitial lung disease. Progressive hypoxia refractory to mechanical ventilation necessitated venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) using the ProtekDuo dual-lumen cannula (LivaNova). In its standard configuration, deoxygenated blood is drained from the right atrium while oxygenated blood is ejected into the main pulmonary artery, and the device serves as both a right ventricular support and an ECMO (RVS-ECMO) cannula. End-stage lung disease was established and, as part of a lung transplant evaluation, the patient underwent catheterization of the left side of the heart and coronary angiography. The left coronary artery angiogram revealed mild luminal irregularities. The right coronary artery (RCA) angiogram is shown in Figure 1 and Video 1. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Right coronary artery compression by the right ventricular angulation of the RVS-ECMO cannula,"Given the information, we will go through 10 potential differential diagnoses step by step:

1. **Dermatomyositis-associated Interstitial Lung Disease (DM-ILD)**: This diagnosis has been confirmed based on history and the patient's presentation.
2. **Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia (COP)**: This condition can present with diffuse, ground-glass opacities and ineffective response to antibiotics.
3. **Acute Interstitial Pneumonia (AIP)**: Rapid onset of respiratory distress and ground-glass opacities could suggest AIP, a form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia.
4. **Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (PAP)**: Characterized by accumulation of proteinaceous material in the alveoli, presenting with ground-glass opacities.
5. **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)**: Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and ground-glass opacities, often due to a variety of underlying causes.
6. **Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP)**: Diffuse ground-glass opacities can also occur in HP, typically a reaction to inhaled organic particles.
7. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) with ILD**: Autoimmune disease that can involve the lungs and present with interstitial lung disease.
8. **Pulmonary Vasculitis**: Can lead to diffuse ground-glass opacities and respiratory failure, as seen in conditions like granulomatosis with polyangiitis.
9. **Non-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP)**: Another idiopathic interstitial pneumonia that can present similarly with ground-glass opacities.
10. **Sarcoidosis**: Though less likely given the rapid progression, sarcoidosis can present with lung involvement and ground-glass opacities.

### Reranking Based on Complete Information:
From the detailed patient history and test results, the top differential diagnoses are reevaluated:

1. **Dermatomyositis-associated Interstitial Lung Disease (DM-ILD)**: This is confirmed based on the patient’s clinical history and presentation.
2. **Acute Interstitial Pneumonia (AIP)**: Given the rapid deterioration, this remains a top differential.
3. **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)**: Due to the severity of hypoxia and rapid progression.
4. **Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia (COP)**: Fits the pattern of response despite empirical antibiotics.
5. **Non-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP)**: Given the autoimmune background, NSIP must be considered.
6. **Pulmonary Vasculitis**: The ground-glass opacities and rapid progression make this a serious consideration.
7. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) with ILD**: This is a less likely but relevant differential given the need to consider autoimmune etiologies.
8. **Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (PAP)**: Although less likely without the classic “crazy paving” on CT, it remains in consideration.
9. **Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP)**: Unlikely given the lack of exposure history.
10. **Sarcoidosis**: Given the rapid progression, it is lower on the differential list but still a potential consideration.

### INPUT:
A middle-aged woman presented with chest pain, elevated troponin-T of 1037 ng/L (normal <14 ng/L; to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1), and anterior T-wave inversion on electrocardiography. She was a smoker with hypertension and kidney dysfunction, with a history of left-sided paresthesia. Coronary angiography demonstrated unobstructed coronary arteries. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging revealed subendocardial midinferolateral late gadolinium enhancement with corresponding hypokinesis consistent with a partial-thickness myocardial infarction. Prolonged Holter monitoring showed no evidence of atrial fibrillation. Two years later, she had a similar presentation consistent with a non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Repeated coronary angiography again demonstrated unobstructed coronary arteries. The CMR revealed the same midinferolateral late gadolinium enhancement as at the initial examination (Figure, A) but with focal enhancement on T2 short tau inversion recovery sequences (Figure, B), with increased T1 and T2 values suggestive of associated edema from an acute infarction in the same territory. A mobile interatrial septum was noted on 4-chamber cine imaging. A transthoracic echocardiogram bubble study demonstrated color flow at rest across the interatrial septum and a large shunt on Valsalva maneuver consistent with a grade 3 patent foramen ovale (PFO) (Video). Coincidentally, a brain MR scan to investigate the recurrent paresthesia revealed bilateral white matter lesions thought to be secondary to small-vessel disease greater in number than expected for the patient’s age, raising suspicion for microemboli. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Paradoxical embolism through PFO causing recurrent systemic embolism,"Let's proceed with the differential diagnosis step by step.

1. **Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO)**
2. **Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy**
3. **Myocarditis**
4. **Prinzmetal's Angina**
5. **Cardiac Sarcoidosis**
6. **Coronary Artery Dissection**
7. **Left Ventricular Non-compaction**
8. **Amyloidosis**
9. **Thromboembolism**
10. **Fibromuscular Dysplasia**

Now, let's rerank the differential diagnoses using all the patient information and test results provided.

1. **Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO)** - The presence of a large shunt on Valsalva maneuver and bilateral white matter lesions suggest microemboli, which can be caused by a PFO.
2. **Thromboembolism** - Given the recurrent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction with unobstructed coronary arteries and brain lesions, thromboembolism secondary to the PFO is highly likely.
3. **Myocarditis** - CMR findings with edema and late gadolinium enhancement could be indicative of myocarditis.
4. **Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy** - Possible considering the presentation, but less likely given the absence of the typical stress triggers and findings.
5. **Coronary Artery Dissection** - Could cause myocardial injury without obstructive coronary disease, though not as supported by imaging.
6. **Prinzmetal's Angina** - Could present with chest pain and ECG changes, but less supported by imaging findings.
7. **Cardiac Sarcoidosis** - Can present with similar imaging findings, but less likely without other systemic involvement.
8. **Fibromuscular Dysplasia** - Less likely in this case given the absence of typical presenting features.
9. **Left Ventricular Non-compaction** - Rare and would typically be diagnosed via imaging earlier.
10. **Amyloidosis** - Unlikely given the focused local findings on imaging and absence of systemic symptoms.

### INPUT:
A 75-year-old man presented with several weeks of intermittent headache that had progressed to severe, persistent headache with right eye pain. He had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. He denied tobacco, alcohol, or drug use. A neurological examination was notable for disorientation to the month, deficits in short-term memory, and an upward drift of the left arm. Cranial nerve, sensory, coordination, and deep tendon reflex examinations were normal. He walked with a slightly wide but steady gait. His serum red and white blood cell counts, coagulation profile, and electrolyte levels were within normal limits. Blood cultures had negative results. A 24-hour electroencephalogram showed right hemispheric slowing and multiple right centroparietal seizures of 1 minute each, without noticeable clinical correlates. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain was remarkable for a large T2-hyperintense lesion in the right temporoparietal region, with an increased diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) signal (low apparent diffusion coefficient), a low signal on susceptibility-weighted imaging, increased T1 signal intensity in and around the lesion, and a contrast-enhancing rim with leptomeningeal enhancement (Figure 1). A smaller satellite lesion with a similar MRI profile was noted inferiorly in the right anterior temporal lobe. A computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not show any metastatic disease. A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile showed a normal red blood cell count and protein and glucose levels and a mildly elevated white blood cell count of 11 cells/μL (to convert to cells × 109/L, multiply by 0.001). The fluid was absent oligoclonal bands and had negative bacterial and fungal culture results, a meningitis-encephalitis polymerase chain reaction panel, and a paraneoplastic panel. Cytology and flow cytometry had negative results. The patient then underwent surgical biopsy of the temporoparietal lesion. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cerebral amyloid angiopathy–related inflammation,"Based on the given patient information, let's proceed step-by-step with the differential diagnosis process considering the unique clinical details described:

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Glioblastoma Multiforme**
   - Due to the MRI findings showing T2-hyperintense lesions, contrast enhancement, and edema, glioblastoma is a primary diagnosis.
   
2. **Primary CNS Lymphoma**
   - Considered because of the MR imaging profile showing contrast enhancement and the patient’s immune status.

3. **Metastatic Brain Tumor**
   - Despite the CT showing no metastatic disease, a primary brain metastasis could still be possible, but less likely due to negative systemic findings.

4. **Brain Abscess**
   - Although blood cultures were negative and CSF did not show infectious results, abscesses can sometimes present this way on imaging.

5. **Subacute Stroke with Hemorrhage**
   - Right hemispheric slowing and MRI findings could suggest subacute stroke, though no recent fibrillatory activity reported.

6. **Leukoencephalopathy**
   - Given patient age and chronic conditions, and considering white matter changes, it can be a differential diagnosis.

7. **Neurosarcoidosis**
   - Rare, but could present with similar MRI findings and systemic inflammatory diseases can present with CNS involvement.

8. **Multifocal Glioma**
   - Given the MRI with a satellite lesion and progression of symptoms, multiple high-grade lesions could signify multifocal glioma.

9. **Chronic Meningoencephalitis**
   - Despite negative CSF findings, chronic infections or slow viral infections can exhibit such clinical and imaging profiles.

10. **Vasculitic Lesion**
    - CNS vasculitis can mimic these symptoms and findings, often with minimal systemic manifestation initially.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Post-Biopsy:

1. **Glioblastoma Multiforme**
   - Most likely due to imaging and clinical presentation, combined with the aggressiveness and location of lesions.

2. **Primary CNS Lymphoma**
   - High suspicion remains considering the imaging findings and immunostaining might pinpoint diagnosis.

3. **Multifocal Glioma**
   - Could present as multiple lesions, imaging suggests aggressive behavior.

4. **Brain Abscess**
   - Unlikely given negative cultures and systemic evidence, but imaging can sometimes mimic malignancy.

5. **Metastatic Brain Tumor**
   - Less likely due to negative systemic findings but inclusion due to imaging.

6. **Neurosarcoidosis**
   - Still a possibility although lack of systemic symptoms downgrades the likelihood.

7. **Vasculitic Lesion**
   - Will remain under consideration due to compatible clinical presentation and MRI findings.

8. **Subacute Stroke with Hemorrhage**
   - Less likely given multiple lesions and MRI characteristics typical for neoplasms or infections.

9. **Leukoencephalopathy**
   - Reduced probability due to focal nature and other aggressive characteristics.

10. **Chronic Meningoencephalitis**
    - Least likely due to negative cultural and PCR findings from CSF analysis.

### INPUT:
A 40-year-old man with refractory glaucoma was referred for decreased vision in the right eye after an aqueous shunting surgical procedure 3 weeks prior. The surgical procedure was a 2-staged Baerveldt implantation after which he developed fluctuating but progressive visual decline. The patient’s ocular history was significant for Sturge-Weber syndrome with bilateral cutaneous port-wine stains, secondary glaucoma in the right eye, and an irregular globe with a white cataract and chronic retinal detachment (RD) in the left eye. At presentation, visual acuity was hand motion OD and a long-standing history of no light perception OS. Intraocular pressures by Goldmann applanation tonometry were 16 mm Hg OD and 28 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination of the right eye revealed a properly positioned plate and tube, and dilated fundus examination revealed a red glow of the fundus with shifting subretinal fluid and RD extending from the 2- to 11-o’clock position (Figure 1A). B-scan ultrasonography of the right eye confirmed the RD and demonstrated homogeneous diffuse choroidal thickening (Figure 1B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Diffuse choroidal hemangioma with exudative retinal detachments,"### 10-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Choroidal Detachment**  
   The homogeneous diffuse choroidal thickening seen on the B-scan ultrasonography could suggest a choroidal detachment.

2. **Uveitis**  
   The shifting subretinal fluid and redness of the fundus in combination with choroidal thickening may point to uveitis.

3. **Hypotony Maculopathy**  
   The history of fluctuating and progressive visual decline post aqueous shunting surgery could be indicative of hypotony maculopathy.

4. **Endophthalmitis**  
   Post-surgical decreased vision, particularly after an invasive procedure like the Baerveldt implantation, raises the possibility of endophthalmitis.

5. **Choroidal Hemorrhage**  
   Post-operative complications like choroidal hemorrhage, especially with diffuse choroidal thickening, could explain the visual decline.

6. **Sympathetic Ophthalmia**  
   The ocular surgical history and bilateral involvement (though one eye is already non-functional) raise the suspicion of sympathetic ophthalmia.

7. **Neovascular Glaucoma**  
   The presence of glaucoma along with fluctuating vision and subretinal fluid might point towards neovascular glaucoma.

8. **Retinal Detachment (RD)**  
   Confirmed RD in the right eye can be a direct cause of progressive visual decline and subretinal fluid.

9. **Submacular Hemorrhage**  
   Consideration should be given to submacular hemorrhage, especially in the context of new or progressive visual decline.

10. **Choroidal Melanoma**  
    The diffuse choroidal thickening drawing attention to choroidal melanoma cannot be ruled out without proper histopathological assessment.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Retinal Detachment (RD)**  
   Given the confirmation of RD by B-scan ultrasonography and clinical presentation, it remains the leading diagnosis.

2. **Endophthalmitis**  
   Post-surgical inflammation and visual decline heavily hint towards endophthalmitis, even though the anterior segment seems fine.

3. **Choroidal Detachment**  
   Consideration of choroidal detachment due to the homogeneous diffuse choroidal thickening observed.

4. **Sympathetic Ophthalmia**  
   Given the history of recent ocular surgery and bilateral ocular disease, sympathetic ophthalmia stays high on the list.

5. **Hypotony Maculopathy**  
   Fluctuating vision post-surgery under the context of aqueous shunting procedure still remains a solid differential.

6. **Choroidal Hemorrhage**  
   Diffuse thickening and post-surgical status prompt attention to possible choroidal hemorrhage.

7. **Uveitis**  
   Shifts in subretinal fluid and diffuse choroidal thickening might suggest uveitis but not at the top given current information.

8. **Neovascular Glaucoma**  
   Glaucoma history with fluctuating visual symptoms places neovascular glaucoma further down due to less supporting evidence at this stage.

9. **Submacular Hemorrhage**  
   Fits some of the visual symptoms but is lower on the list due to a lack of conclusive clinical evidence directly pointing.

10. **Choroidal Melanoma**  
    While it remains a consideration due to chronicity and choroidal changes, it is less immediately supported by the acute clinical history.

### INPUT:
A 49-year-old African American man who was hospitalized with hypervolemia due to supraventricular tachycardia presented with acute unilateral painless vision loss. His active medical problems included atrial flutter on anticoagulation, antisynthetase syndrome (which was diagnosed based on the presence of autoantibodies against aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase), fever with negative infectious workup results, and interstitial lung disease that was managed with azathioprine. Two weeks before the onset of sudden vision loss, the patient developed a rapidly evolving purpuric rash on his hands and feet that progressed to digital ischemia (Figure 1A). He was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone, which was completed 3 days before the onset of loss of vision and transitioned to treatment with azathioprine, 150 mg, and prednisone, 80 mg, that he was taking at the time of his vision loss. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Frosted branch angiitis due to retinal vasculitis that was associated with antisynthetase syndrome,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps

1. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)** - considering acute unilateral painless vision loss, this is a foremost concern.
2. **Ischemic Optic Neuropathy** - given the patient's history of vascular issues and current symptoms.
3. **Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA)** - possible due to sudden vision loss and involvement of systemic symptoms such as fever.
4. **Vasculitis (due to Antisynthetase Syndrome)** - the background of antisynthetase syndrome and recent purpuric rash suggests systemic vasculitic processes.
5. **Retinal Vein Occlusion** - another vascular pathology that can present with painless vision loss.
6. **Optic Neuritis** - less likely given the absence of pain, but still a differential considering immune-mediated processes.
7. **Posterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy** - more rare, but consistent with the patient's vascular background.
8. **Talc Retinopathy** - considering drug history and systemic issues, although less common.
9. **Drug-induced Retinopathy (e.g., from azathioprine)** - though infrequent, possible with immunosuppressive medications.
10. **Herpetic Retinopathy** - considering immunosuppression and risk of opportunistic infections, although not typical for acute painless vision loss.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

After considering all patient information and test results:

1. **Vasculitis (due to Antisynthetase Syndrome)** - High likelihood because the patient has underlying antisynthetase syndrome, which can cause wide-ranging vascular complications, including involvement of retinal vasculature.
2. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)** - Consistent with acute painless vision loss and possible thromboembolic events given his atrial flutter and anticoagulation.
3. **Ischemic Optic Neuropathy** - Possible due to the patient’s vascular history and clinical presentation.
4. **Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA)** - Systemic inflammatory condition causing sudden vision loss, needs exclusion urgently.
5. **Retinal Vein Occlusion** - Matches vascular issues seen in such patients, though less acute onset typically.
6. **Talc Retinopathy** - If there is any history of IV drug use, considering systemic embolization.
7. **Posterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy** - Vascular compromise is fitting, although it’s rare.
8. **Drug-induced Retinopathy (e.g., from azathioprine)** - Possible, but vision loss onset more acute here.
9. **Herpetic Retinopathy** - Considering immunosuppression, but less likely because of atypical presentation.
10. **Optic Neuritis** - Usually associated with pain and less likely in this context but remains in the differential.

### INPUT:
A man in his 60s presented to the clinic with a several-day history of nontender, nonitchy purpuric rash on his scalp. The patient denied using any over-the-counter or prescription topicals at the affected sites before the onset of the eruption except for petroleum jelly. His medical history was significant for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and allergic contact dermatitis. The patient reported being started on ibrutinib and allopurinol therapy 6 weeks prior to the rash onset for treatment of CLL. Physical examination revealed multiple purpuric, nonblanchable macules and patches on the frontal, vertex, temporal, and parietal scalp (Figure, A). A punch biopsy specimen from the scalp was obtained for histopathologic analysis (Figure, B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Ibrutinib-induced toxic effects,"Based on the provided information, I will generate a 10-step differential diagnosis approach before considering final test results to re-rank them. Here are the differential diagnoses, followed by a ranking based on available patient information.

1. **Drug-induced vasculitis**

**Step 2:**
2. **Paraneoplastic syndrome**

**Step 3:**
3. **Leukocytoclastic vasculitis**

7. **Hematologic malignancy (CLL-related skin involvement)**

**Step 8:**
8. **Vasculopathy secondary to CLL**

**Step 9:**
9. **Infectious endocarditis presenting as Janeway lesions**

**Step 10:**
10. **Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)**

### Reranking Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Drug-induced vasculitis** - The recent initiation of ibrutinib and allopurinol becomes significant here. Drug-induced vasculitis has been recognized with these medications.
2. **Leukocytoclastic vasculitis** - This condition is possibly secondary to the medication (ibrutinib), commonly presenting as a purpuric rash.
3. **Vasculopathy secondary to CLL** - Patients with CLL can develop purpuric rashes due to various vasculopathy mechanisms.
4. **Hematologic malignancy (CLL-related skin involvement)** - CLL itself can present with skin manifestations due to leukemic infiltrates.
5. **Thrombocytopenia** - Often associated with CLL and can present as a purpuric rash.
6. **Paraneoplastic syndrome** - Given his history of CLL, paraneoplastic syndromes need to be considered.
7. **Cryoglobulinemia** - Less likely, but CLL can sometimes be associated with cryoglobulinemia, presenting with purpuric rash.
8. **Amyloidosis** - Rare and less common but can be considered in systemic conditions.
9. **Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)** - Not the highest on the list due to the presenting features and clinical history, although CLL can predispose to autoimmune phenomena.
10. **Infectious endocarditis presenting as Janeway lesions** - Unlikely but considered due to purpuric lesions, despite the lack of other systemic infectious signs.

### INPUT:
An 82-year-old man with an ocular history significant for bilateral nuclear sclerotic cataracts presented to the Cornea Service at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, Miami, Florida, with a history of blurred vision in the right eye after phacoemulsification cataract extraction 8 weeks earlier. Current ophthalmic medications included topical prednisolone acetate, 1%, in the right eye 6 times per day. The patient reported no improvement with the treatment. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 OD and 20/20 OS. Pupils were reactive without relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressures were 18 mm Hg in the right eye and 11 mm Hg in the left eye. A slitlamp biomicroscopic examination of the right eye revealed grade 2 to 3 diffuse central corneal edema and folds (Figure 1). The anterior chamber was deep and the posterior chamber intraocular lens was in good position within the capsular bag. Although the view to the posterior pole of the right eye was hazy owing to corneal edema, dilated fundus examination findings were unremarkable. Examination of the left eye revealed a few guttate. The central corneal thickness by ultrasound pachymetry was 957 μm in the right eye and 547 μm in the left eye. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Corneal edema after cataract surgery secondary to intraoperative Descemet membrane detachment (Figure 2),"### Initial Differential Diagnosis (Step-by-Step)

1. **Pseudophakic Bullous Keratopathy (PBK)**  
   - The patient’s history of recent cataract surgery and corneal edema is a strong indicator.
   
2. **Fuchs' Endothelial Dystrophy**  
   - Presence of guttate in the left eye and corneal edema in the right.

3. **Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS)**  
   - Occurrence post-surgery and persistent edema despite treatment.

4. **Infectious Keratitis**  
   - Given the corneal edema and the absence of visual improvement.

5. **Postoperative Inflammation or Uveitis**  
   - The use of topical steroids and recent surgery could be indicative.

6. **Herpetic Keratitis**  
   - Persistent corneal edema and no improvement with steroids could suggest herpetic etiology.

7. **Retained Lens Material**  
   - Consider this if the performance of the surgery was complicated.

8. **Primary Endothelial Failure**  
   - Could explain the severe corneal edema.

9. **Misdiagnosed Pre-existing Corneal Pathology**  
   - Considering a background history that may have not been identified preoperatively.

10. **Medication-induced Corneal Edema**  
    - Some eye drops or medications can cause corneal complications.

### Reranking Based on Comprehensive Information and Test Results:

1. **Pseudophakic Bullous Keratopathy (PBK)**  
2. **Fuchs' Endothelial Dystrophy**  
3. **Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS)**  
4. **Primary Endothelial Failure**  
5. **Postoperative Inflammation or Uveitis**  
6. **Infectious Keratitis**  
7. **Herpetic Keratitis**  
8. **Retained Lens Material**  
9. **Misdiagnosed Pre-existing Corneal Pathology**  
10. **Medication-induced Corneal Edema**

### Critical Rationale for Reranking:
- **PBK**: The leading hypothesis due to the close similarity in patient presentation and common occurrence post phacoemulsification.
- **Fuchs' Endothelial Dystrophy**: Guttate observed in the non-operated eye is suggestive.
- **TASS**: The timing and poor response to steroids align with this condition.
- **Primary Endothelial Failure**: Severity of corneal edema and thickness readings are consistent.
- **Postoperative Inflammation or Uveitis**: The symptoms and need for ongoing steroids.
- **Infectious Keratitis**: Less likely without overt signs of infection but still possible.
- **Herpetic Keratitis**: Persistent edema without improvement from steroids could suggest this.
- **Retained Lens Material**: Lower on the list but still a potential cause given the intraoperative factors.
- **Misdiagnosed Pre-existing Corneal Pathology**: Uncommon but worth considering.
- **Medication-induced Corneal Edema**: Least likely given the nature of symptoms and current treatment.

### INPUT:
A 17-month-old boy was referred to pediatric dermatology for evaluation of a slow-growing, nontender plaque on the lower back. The child's mother reported that, on discovery, the plaque was initially 1 × 1 cm and had since grown in size with the child. She was uncertain if the plaque was present at birth. The patient’s medical history was significant for dermal melanocytosis of the right hip and mid back, increased head circumference (97th percentile), and expressive language delay. There was no family history of congenital birthmarks or neurofibromatosis type 1 or 2. Physical examination revealed a well-appearing boy with normal vital signs and Fitzpatrick type III skin type. On the left lower back, there was a 15 × 5-cm indurated skin-colored to yellow, firm, multinodular plaque with hypertrichosis, extending from the midline to the left lower flank (Figure, A). There were additional blue-gray patches on the back and right hip, as well as a small café au lait macule on the right lower back. Limited neurologic examination was within normal limits. A 4-mm punch biopsy was performed for further diagnostic evaluation (Figure, B-D).

9. **Juvenile Fibrosarcoma**
10. **Congenital Melanocytic Nevus**

### Reranking Using All Patient Information and Tests:

1. **Congenital Infiltrating Lipomatosis:** Given the indurated, firm, multinodular nature of the plaque, this condition is characterized by abnormal growth involving deep tissues and often exhibits hypertrichosis.
2. **Congenital Melanocytic Nevus:** Presence does not exclude it; usually presents at birth or shortly after but can appear later, and may have overlying hair.
3. **Sebaceous Nevus:** Typically appears as a solitary, yellowish plaque that might grow with age.
4. **Becker’s Nevus:** Can present with hypertrichosis and is usually well-defined, often appearing in adolescence but congruent with rapid growth.
5. **Linear Morphea:** This could present as an indurated plaque but is often associated with shiny, sclerotic changes.
6. **Juvenile Xanthogranuloma:** Typically presents as solitary, yellowish nodules but differing from the appearance observed.
7. **Infantile Myofibromatosis:** Often presents with firm, nodular masses but may show more extensive tissue involvement.
8. **Nevus Lipomatosus Superficialis:** Usually softer and less indurated than described, without hypertrichosis.
9. **Early-Onset Sclerosis Cutis:** While it can present with induration, it is a rare condition for the described demographic.
10. **Juvenile Fibrosarcoma:** Least likely without more aggressive/local destructive features.

### INPUT:
A 9-year-old boy was referred to the pediatric otolaryngology clinic with a 3-month history of a left-sided neck mass. The mass had been slowly enlarging and he had been experiencing mild intermittent pain, but no additional symptoms were reported. His medical history was significant for several episodes of upper respiratory infection during the previous winter season, and he previously had an adenotonsillectomy several years prior and bilateral ear tubes placed 1 year before presentation. Physical examination showed a mildly tender, nonmobile, left parotid mass near the angle of the mandible with no overlying skin changes or drainage around the mass. There was no lymphadenopathy or other lesions noted in the neck area, and cranial nerve VII was fully intact. Ultrasonography results of the neck showed a left 1.5-cm preauricular nodular mass with internal and marginal vascularity. A neck magnetic resonance imaging study without contrast performed at an outside institution revealed the 1.5-cm heterogeneous intraparotid nodule that was predominantly isotense to glandular tissue on T1 images with vague hypointensity of a small irregular central region, as well as vague hyperintensity on T2 images. He subsequently underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy to assess the lesion, which demonstrated benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells. The mass was continuing to enlarge, and the patient’s pain was increasing in that area, so the decision was made to perform left superficial parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Intraoperatively, the left parotid mass was noted to be just below the lower branches of the facial nerve. The excised parotid mass was sent to the pathology department for analysis. Gross examination of the specimen demonstrated a 1.6 × 1.5 × 1.1–cm tan-white, well-circumscribed lesion that was partially surrounded by salivary gland parenchyma (Figure, A). Histologic examination of the nodule was performed (Figure, B and C). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Sclerosing polycystic adenoma,"To approach this case, we need to systematically consider the differential diagnoses and subsequently rank them based on the full clinical presentation and test results. Let's proceed step by step.

### Initial Differential Diagnoses:
1. **Pleomorphic Adenoma**
2. **Warthin’s Tumor**
3. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma**
4. **Lymphoma**
5. **Chronic Sialadenitis**
6. **Benign Lymphoepithelial Lesion (BLEL)**
7. **Basal Cell Adenoma**
8. **Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma**
9. **Salivary Ductal Carcinoma**
10. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**

### Revised and Ranked Differential Diagnoses:
Based on the patient's history, physical examination, imaging studies, fine needle aspiration biopsy results, and intraoperative findings, we can re-evaluate and rank the potential diagnoses.

1. **Pleomorphic Adenoma**: Given the benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells on FNA, and the well-circumscribed nature of the lesion, pleomorphic adenoma is the most likely diagnosis.
   
2. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma**: A possibility due to the mass effect and increase in size over time. However, the benign appearance on FNA makes it less likely.

3. **Warthin’s Tumor**: Typically occurs in older adults and is often associated with smoking. It appears bilaterally in 5-14% of cases which don't fit our case.

4. **Basal Cell Adenoma**: Can present as a well-circumscribed parotid mass, though less common than pleomorphic adenoma.

5. **Chronic Sialadenitis**: Typically, there would be inflammatory changes or symptoms of repeated infections beyond a simple mass effect.

6. **Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma**: Malignant and more aggressive, usually presenting with pain and nerve involvement which are not prominent here.

7. **Benign Lymphoepithelial Lesion (BLEL)**: Often associated with systemic disease like Sjogren's syndrome. Given the localized presentation here, less likely.

8. **Lymphoma**: Given the benign appearance on biopsy, and no systemic symptoms or lymphadenopathy, it's less favored.

9. **Salivary Ductal Carcinoma**: Significantly more aggressive with likely infiltrative characteristics on imaging.

10. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**: Typically presents earlier in childhood and would likely have a cystic rather than nodular appearance on imaging.

Thus, our final revised rankings favor the most benign and common entities given the patient's age, clinical presentation, and histologic findings.","['Pediatrics', 'Otolaryngology', 'Salivary Gland Disorders', 'Dental Medicine']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,M

A 71-year-old woman with non-Hodgkin lymphoma receiving maintenance obinutuzumab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) infusions underwent uneventful pars plana vitrectomy of the right eye for vitreomacular traction. Diluted triamcinolone acetonide (TA) was used to stain the posterior hyaloid. After removal of 25-gauge trocar cannulas, subconjunctival TA and ceftazidime was injected. Owing to cystoid changes in the central macula, a short-acting gas tamponade with sulfur hexafluoride was used to tamponade any cystoid abnormalities that may have been unroofed. Despite unremarkable postoperative day 1 (POD1) examination findings, the patient presented on postoperative week 3 with a painless central scotoma and worsening floaters. Her visual acuity was 20/400 OD and intraocular pressure was normal. There was no external hyperemia or chemosis, and the anterior chamber was deep and quiet with no cells or flare. On dilated fundus examination, there were 15 to 20 cells per high-power field (using a 1 × 1-mm2 high-intensity incidental slit beam) and a white macular lesion with disc edema and scattered intraretinal and peripapillary hemorrhages and mixed venous and arterial sheathing. Optical coherence tomography of the macula showed atrophy, full-thickness hyperreflectivity, and a residual epiretinal membrane (Figure).

9. **Syphilitic Retinitis**
10. **Behçet Disease**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis**
    - Given the patient’s history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and immunosuppressive therapy, susceptibility to opportunistic infections such as CMV retinitis is high. The presence of white retinal lesions and hemorrhages is suggestive of CMV.

2. **Acute Retinal Necrosis**
    - This condition is often seen in immunocompromised individuals and presents with retinal necrosis, inflammation, and hemorrhages, fitting the clinical presentation.

3. **Primary Intraocular Lymphoma**
    - Given the history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, intraocular lymphoma remains a concern. The presence of retinal infiltrates and vitritis supports this possibility.

4. **Toxoplasma Chorioretinitis**
    - While less common in the immunocompromised, toxoplasmosis can present with similar retinal findings and should be considered.

5. **Infectious Endophthalmitis**
    - Although the delayed presentation and absence of severe external signs are less typical, it remains a differential due to the postoperative period and visual decline.

6. **Candida Endophthalmitis**
    - While more commonly associated with systemic candidiasis, intraocular involvement can occur, especially in immunocompromised patients.

7. **Viral Retinitis (HSV, VZV)**
    - Both HSV and VZV retinitis can produce similar findings, though these are less likely given the patient's clinical history and absence of typical vesicular rash.

8. **Syphilitic Retinitis**
    - Despite being less common, syphilitic retinitis can present with multifocal chorioretinitis and should be considered, particularly with specific serologic testing.

9. **Bacterial Retinitis**
    - Direct bacterial infections of the retina are rare but must be considered, especially in an immunocompromised setting.

10. **Behçet Disease**
    - Presents with uveitis and retinal vascular changes but is less likely due to the primary presentation and absence of systemic signs.","['Infectious Diseases', 'Ophthalmology', 'Retinal Disorders', 'Macular Diseases']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,71.0,F

A girl younger than 2 years presented with a 1-year history of slightly pruritic lesions involving her face. She was born after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery, and her growth and development were appropriate for her age. No associated symptoms such as fever, anorexia, or weight loss were noted. Physical examination revealed multiple skin-colored and erythematous follicular papules, 1 to 2 mm in diameter, distributed in a segmental pattern on the right side of the forehead, as well as the dorsum and tip of the nose. A small, excoriated plaque was also noted on the right malar area (Figure 1A). No mucosal lesions were present, and the rest of the physical examination findings were unremarkable. A complete hematological and biochemical survey, including blood cell count, liver and renal function tests, C-reactive protein levels, thyroid function, rheumatoid factor, and antinuclear antibodies, disclosed no abnormalities. Two skin punch biopsies were taken from the forehead and nose. Representative histopathological features are shown in Figure 1B and C. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Idiopathic follicular mucinosis,"### Preliminary Differential Diagnosis Steps:
1. **Atopic Dermatitis** - Given the age, duration, and slightly pruritic nature of the lesions.
2. **Molluscum Contagiosum** - Common in young children and can present with multiple skin-colored papules.
3. **Keratosis Pilaris** - Considered due to the follicular nature of the papules.
4. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - Persistent and multiple papules can be a clue.
5. **Linear Epidermal Nevus** - Segmental pattern of lesions.
6. **Infantile Hemangioma** - Can present as multiple, small lesions especially in early childhood.
7. **Nevus Comedonicus** - Follicular papules in a linear distribution.
8. **Sebaceous Nevus** - Presence of a plaque and papules, often congenital.
9. **Milian Dermatosis** - Given the persistent nature of lesions over a year.
10. **Segmental Neurofibromatosis** - Habitual, segmental arrangement of cutaneous nodules.

### Revised Ranking Based on Additional Patient Information and Histopathological Features:
1. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - Biopsy and persistent, multiple papules are suggestive.
2. **Nevus Comedonicus** - The follicular papules in a segmental pattern.
3. **Linear Epidermal Nevus** - Segmental lesions are typical.
4. **Atopic Dermatitis** - Common in young children but typically more pruritic and widespread.
5. **Keratosis Pilaris** - Common in kids but less likely segmental.
6. **Molluscum Contagiosum** - Follicular papules but typically more waxy in appearance.
7. **Milian Dermatosis** - Persistent lesions but distribution less characteristic.
8. **Segmental Neurofibromatosis** - Less likely without systemic features.
9. **Infantile Hemangioma** - Typically vascular and not follicular papules.
10. **Sebaceous Nevus** - Typically more structured lesions, often congenital.

### INPUT:
A 47-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes for more than 15 years was referred for proliferative diabetic retinopathy management. Her chief complaint was acute onset of blurry vision in the right eye. She described intermittent foggy vision and the appearance of “a hair moving across the vision of her right eye” for the past few weeks. Her most recent hemoglobin A1c level was 8.3%, and 2 months prior to her visit, she had restarted diabetes medications. Her medications included metformin and glimepiride. Her corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Her pupil, color vision, and anterior segment examinations had normal results bilaterally. A posterior segment examination of the right eye showed mild temporal elevation of the optic disc with blurred margins, mild peripapillary hemorrhages, a small amount of preretinal hemorrhage, and small-caliber branching vessels at the temporal disc with no fibrosis (Figure 1A). The left eye showed a normal optic disc, a cup-disc ratio of 0.1, and some microaneurysms at the macula. There were a few scattered dot-blot hemorrhages bilaterally. Fluorescein angiography of the right eye showed mild leakage from the abnormal vessels at the temporal optic disc (Figure 1B).

2. **Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO)**:
    - Presence of peripapillary hemorrhages and small-caliber branching vessels at the temporal disc could suggest BRVO.

3. **Ischemic Optic Neuropathy**:
    - Mild temporal elevation of the optic disc with blurred margins might be indicative of optic nerve ischemia.

4. **Vitreous Hemorrhage**:
    - Complaint of “a hair moving across the vision” could suggest bleeding into the vitreous humor.

5. **Optic Disc Edema due to Hypertension**:
    - Long-standing history of hypertension could lead to hypertensive retinopathy with optic disc changes.

6. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)**:
    - Diffuse retinal hemorrhages and optic disc swelling would be more pronounced, less likely, but possible in diabetic patients.

7. **Ocular Ischemic Syndrome**:
    - Severe ischemia due to carotid artery disease could cause similar findings.

8. **Neovascular Glaucoma**:
    - Abnormal vessel growth at the optic disc might lead to secondary glaucoma.

9. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis**:
    - Particularly in immunocompromised patients, though less likely with controlled diabetes.

10. **Retinal Vein Occlusion due to Hypercoagulability**:
    - Increased risk in diabetic patients for hypercoagulable states leading to vein occlusion.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses Based on All Information:

1. **Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy**:
    - Primary diagnosis given the patient’s long-standing diabetes, findings fit well.

2. **Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO)**:
    - Close second, supported by peripapillary hemorrhages and branching vessels.

3. **Vitreous Hemorrhage**:
    - Visual disturbances described align with vitreous hemorrhage.

4. **Ischemic Optic Neuropathy**:
    - Optic disc changes could be attributed to ischemia, particularly given diabetes and blurred disc margins.

5. **Hypertensive Retinopathy**:
    - Hypertension complicates diabetic retinopathy and can lead to similar retinal findings.

6. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)**:
    - Less likely than BRVO but still clinically relevant.

7. **Ocular Ischemic Syndrome**:
    - Fits ischemic findings but less common in this presentation without carotid examination results.

8. **Neovascular Glaucoma**:
    - Could develop secondary to proliferative changes but requires intraocular pressure measurement and assessment of glaucoma signs.

9. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis**:
    - Unlikely with only diabetes and normal immune status in the provided information.

10. **Retinal Vein Occlusion due to Hypercoagulability**:
    - Fits within the broader differential, but less likely without additional hypercoagulable states information.

### INPUT:
A 29-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of rapidly growing, widespread, asymptomatic skin nodules all over his body. He denied having fever, chills, fatigue, night sweats, or weight loss. He had no history of malignant neoplasm or chemical exposure. Physical examination findings demonstrated numerous erythematous, indurated nodules involving the surface of his head, neck, torso, and extremities, without ulceration or scarring (Figure, A and B). Findings of systemic reviews were unremarkable, and there was no lymphadenopathy or peripheral nerve enlargement. Complete blood cell count with differential results were normal (white blood cell count, 6060/μL, normal range, 4500-10 000/μL; absolute neutrophils, 3070/μL, normal range, 1800-8300/μL [to convert cell counts to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]). Serum lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated (279 U/L, normal range, 100-240 U/L [to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167]). Biopsies from skin nodules (Figure, C) and bone marrow were obtained.

7. **Eruptive xanthomas**
8. **Leprosy (Hansen's Disease)**
9. **Systemic lupus erythematosus with cutaneous manifestations**
10. **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Cutaneous lymphoma** - Considering the rapidly growing, widespread, asymptomatic nodules and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level, cutaneous lymphoma is highly probable.
2. **Liposarcoma** - Typically presents as a rapidly growing mass; however, skin involvement usually is not this widespread.
3. **Cutaneous metastasis** from an unknown primary malignancy - Rapid nodular spread on the skin, but lacks internal malignancy symptoms.
4. **Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans** - Unlikely given the numerous widespread nodules without typical plaque presentation.
5. **Sarcoidosis** - Erythematous nodules possible, though no other systemic symptoms are noted.
6. **Leprosy (Hansen's Disease)** - Distribution and skin involvement fit, but absence of nerve enlargement and other signs reduce probability.
7. **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis** - Systemic involvement usually more pronounced.
8. **Systemic lupus erythematosus with cutaneous manifestations** - Unlikely without other lupus symptoms and normal systemic reviews.
9. **Cutaneous leishmaniasis** - Typically causes ulceration, not indicated in this patient.
10. **Eruptive xanthomas** - Due to lipid metabolism disorder, less likely given presentation and history.

6. **Brugada Syndrome**
7. **Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia (MAT)**
8. **Atrial Fibrillation (AF)**
9. **Atrial Flutter**
10. **Sinus Node Dysfunction**

### Reranking Based on All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome**
   - Characterized by episodes of palpitations and the presence of a wide QRS complex on ECG.
   - Sudden onset and offset of symptoms are typical.
   - Improvement with physical activity might indicate involvement of accessory pathways.

2. **Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT)**
   - Common in teenagers, presenting with sudden-onset palpitations.
   - Can sometimes present with wide QRS complexes.

3. **Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)**
   - Manifests with wide QRS complexes and palpitations.
   - Less likely given the young age and lack of structural heart disease.

4. **Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs)**
   - Could present with episodic palpitations.
   - Typically does not account for sustained symptoms as described.

5. **Long QT Syndrome**
   - Episodes of palpitations and syncope can occur.
   - Generally involves prolonged QT interval on ECG, not mentioned here.

6. **Brugada Syndrome**
   - Characterized by specific ECG findings which were not described.
   - Typically presents with syncope or sudden cardiac death rather than isolated palpitations.

7. **Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia (MAT)**
   - Typically occurs in individuals with underlying chronic pulmonary disease.
   - Symptoms and signs don't match perfectly.

8. **Atrial Fibrillation (AF)**
   - Can sometimes present with wide QRS complexes in preexcitation syndromes.
   - Less common in teenagers without underlying heart disease.

9. **Atrial Flutter**
   - Causes palpitations but typically leads to a regular rhythm that would be evident on ECG.

10. **Sinus Node Dysfunction**
    - Can cause palpitations, but less likely given the episodic and recurrent nature described.

Following a step-by-step assessment that integrates patient history, clinical presentation, physical examination, and test results, **Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome** remains the most likely diagnosis. PSVT is also a strong consideration given the sudden onset and offset of symptoms. The wide QRS complex noted on the ECG should prompt careful follow-up and possibly further electrophysiological studies to confirm the presence of an accessory pathway, characteristic of WPW Syndrome.","['Rhythm Disorders', 'Cardiology', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Pediatrics']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1.0,F

### INPUT:
A male in his 60s presented with a hoarse and weak voice. He has a history of follicular lymphoma with multiple relapses treated with an allogeneic stem cell transplant complicated by graft-vs-host disease and was treated with sirolimus and steroids. Flexible fiber-optic nasolaryngoscopy demonstrated symmetric nodular projections with edema along the whole length of both true vocal folds (Figure 1A). The patient underwent microdirect laryngoscopy and biopsy of the vocal fold lesions. The histopathologic image is shown in Figure 1B. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Rhabdomyoma,"Sure, let's proceed with a step-by-step differential diagnosis while considering the clinical presentation, history, and initial findings:
     
1. **Recurrent Laryngeal Papillomatosis**  
   - Given the presence of symmetric nodular projections with edema along the true vocal folds, recurrent laryngeal papillomatosis should be considered.

2. **Laryngeal Cancer**  
   - A history of cancer and the presence of nodular lesions could suggest a secondary malignant process.

3. **Vocal Cord Nodules (Singer's Nodules)**  
   - These are common benign lesions caused by voice overuse, presenting with nodular projections.

4. **Vocal Fold Granulomas**  
   - Granulomas typically present with nodular projects and are often due to irritation or injury.

5. **Sarcoidosis**  
   - This systemic granulomatous disease can involve the vocal folds and present with similar nodular lesions.

6. **Amyloidosis**  
   - Amyloidosis can deposit in the vocal folds, creating nodular projections and edema.

7. **Vocal Fold Cysts**  
   - Cysts on the vocal folds can present as nodular lesions, although they are usually unilateral.

8. **Graft-vs-Host Disease (GVHD)**  
   - Given his history of GVHD, mucosal involvement may present in the larynx.

9. **Infectious Laryngitis (e.g., fungal)**  
   - Immune suppression from sirolimus and steroids can predispose infections presenting with similar findings.

10. **Autoimmune Diseases (e.g., Lupus)**  
    - Systemic autoimmune diseases can manifest in the larynx with similar nodular and edematous changes.

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Recurrent Laryngeal Papillomatosis**  
2. **Graft-vs-Host Disease (GVHD)**
3. **Laryngeal Cancer**
4. **Amyloidosis**

7. **Vocal Cord Nodules (Singer's Nodules)**
8. **Vocal Fold Cysts**
9. **Vocal Fold Granulomas**
10. **Autoimmune Diseases (e.g., Lupus)**

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old woman presented to the clinic with intermittent pain inside her mouth and a progressive decline in oral aperture that had developed over the prior year. She described a burning sensation inside her mouth that worsened with using mouthwash and eating spicy foods. She had no history of cigarette smoking or use of chewing tobacco but had chewed areca nuts for many years while living in India. Currently, she reported chewing areca nuts daily to weekly. Physical examination revealed white-tan plaques on the oral mucosa and thickened buccal mucosae bilaterally (Figure). Her lips and perioral skin appeared healthy, and the interincisal distance, defined as the distance between the tips of the frontal incisors when the mouth is opened as wide as possible, was approximately 25 mm (reference, >35 mm). Examination of a biopsy sample of the lower left labial mucosa revealed subepithelial fibrosis with stromal hyalinization, without epithelial dysplasia or inflammatory changes.

7. **Systemic Sclerosis**
8. **Erythroplakia**
9. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**
10. **Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Oral Submucous Fibrosis (OSMF)**: The patient's history of areca nut chewing, progressive oral aperture decline, and biopsy findings of subepithelial fibrosis with stromal hyalinization are classic features of OSMF.
  
2. **Leukoplakia**: While the white-tan plaques could suggest leukoplakia, the absence of epithelial dysplasia in biopsy reduces the likelihood but cannot be entirely excluded.

3. **Lichen Planus**: The burning sensation could be consistent with lichen planus; however, the absence of common histological features such as lymphocytic infiltrate and hyperkeratosis makes it less likely.

4. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: This condition should be considered, particularly with a background of chronic irritation, yet the biopsy lacks features of malignancy, pushing it lower on the list.

5. **Sjogren's Syndrome**: Despite causing oral discomfort, this autoimmune condition typically presents with systemic symptoms and salivary gland involvement not noted here.

6. **Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid**: This can present with oral lesions but typically involves more extensive mucosal erosions and a different histopathology.

7. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**: This would present with more widespread and erosive mucosal lesions, often with acantholysis on biopsy, not seen here.

8. **Erythroplakia**: While it is premalignant, the presentation and biopsy findings do not align well with the typical appearance and diagnosis of erythroplakia.

9. **Oral Candidiasis**: Typically, white patches in candidiasis can be rubbed off, and the burning could persist, but the plaques and systemic fibrosis are not characteristic of candidiasis.

10. **Systemic Sclerosis**: Often presents with skin thickening and systemic manifestations, not matching the localized findings seen in this patient.

### Conclusion:
With the history of areca nut use, clinical presentation, and specific biopsy findings, **Oral Submucous Fibrosis (OSMF)** remains the most likely diagnosis.","['Tobacco and e-Cigarettes', 'Dental Medicine', 'Pain Medicine', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine', 'Lifestyle Behaviors']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,63.0,F

### INPUT:
An 11-year-old girl presented to the dermatology clinic in autumn with an asymptomatic rash on her arms, face, and legs of a 3-week duration. She was otherwise healthy with a history of having seasonal allergies and taking cetirizine. She had negative results from the review of systems and denied any recent illnesses, vaccinations, or new medications. Physical examination was notable for erythematous annular thin plaques without surface change on her right cheek (Figure 1A), an erythematous, edematous plaque on her nose (Figure 1A), and erythematous, edematous, annular papules and plaques on her arms, hands, and thighs (Figure 1B). A biopsy specimen was obtained from the right arm for histopathologic analysis. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cutaneous lupus erythematosus,"### Stepwise Differential Diagnosis

#### Step 1: Tinea Corporis (Ringworm)
Considering the annular plaques and erythematous rash, Tinea corporis, a fungal infection, needs to be ruled out.

#### Step 2: Nummular Eczema
The annular and erythematous nature of the plaques could also indicate Nummular eczema.

#### Step 3: Granuloma Annulare
A common cause of asymptomatic, annular plaques in children is Granuloma annulare.

#### Step 4: Erythema Multiforme
This condition is characterized by annular plaques with erythematous papules and could be considered despite the absence of new medications or illnesses.

#### Step 5: Pityriasis Rosea
Pityriasis rosea often presents with a herald patch and subsequent annular lesions, commonly in children and young adults.

#### Step 6: Lupus Erythematosus
Cutaneous manifestations such as annular and erythematous plaques can be seen in lupus erythematosus.

#### Step 7: Urticaria
Although typically transient, chronic urticaria could present as erythematous, edematous plaques.

#### Step 8: Psoriasis
Psoriasis can present with erythematous plaques, sometimes annular in morphology.

#### Step 9: Dermatitis Herpetiformis
Annular plaques or papulovesicular rash could be indicative of Dermatitis herpetiformis, although this is typically intensely pruritic.

#### Step 10: Sarcoidosis
Sarcoidosis can present with cutaneous manifestations, including erythematous plaques, albeit less common in children.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Granuloma Annulare**: Most consistent with asymptomatic, annular erythematous lesions, especially in the pediatric population.
2. **Erythema Multiforme**: Annular lesions with erythematous papules align closely with her symptoms. 
3. **Nummular Eczema**: The morphology fits, and it is a common condition.
4. **Pityriasis Rosea**: Often presents with similar lesions, common in children.
5. **Lupus Erythematosus**: The annular erythematous plaques suggest possible cutaneous lupus.
6. **Tinea Corporis**: Fungal infections can present similarly, although usually pruritic.
7. **Urticaria**: Chronic urticaria could present as erythematous, edematous plaques.
8. **Psoriasis**: Although more common in older children and adults, it is still a consideration.
9. **Dermatitis Herpetiformis**: Less common and typically pruritic, but similar appearance.
10. **Sarcoidosis**: Rare in children but can present with cutaneous plaques.

### INPUT:
A Black woman in her early 70s with a history of coronary artery disease after coronary artery bypass operations, hypertension, and colon polyps presented to oculoplastic surgery with 1 week of progressive right-sided proptosis and headache, described as severe pain radiating to the back of her head. This was associated with right eyelid ptosis and blurry vision. Prior to presentation, an outside ophthalmologist treated her with 1 week of oral prednisone, 20 mg/d, for presumed orbital inflammation with no improvement. She denied additional symptoms. Notably, she described headache and sudden vision loss in the right eye after coronary artery bypass grafting 1 year ago for several days before spontaneous improvement with incomplete resolution. Personal and family histories were negative for malignant neoplasm and autoimmune disease. Examination revealed right-sided uncorrected Snellen visual acuity of 20/60 associated with restricted supraduction, abduction, and infraduction. Pupils were equal in size without a relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressures were 10 mm Hg OD and 11 mm Hg OS. Visual fields had temporal restriction to confrontation of the right eye. Vision, motility, and visual fields were normal on the left. Pertinent findings included right-sided proptosis of 2 mm, cranial nerve V1 and V2 hypoesthesia, eyelid ptosis with a margin to reflex distance 1 of 0 mm, optic disc pallor, and vessel attenuation. Outside magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an infiltrative mass involving right greater than left orbital apices, the right optic nerve, and right extraocular muscles. There was enhancement of the cavernous sinuses, right pterygopalatine fossa, right sphenoid wing, and right middle cranial fossa dura (Figure 1). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Neurosarcoidosis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Orbital Tumor** - Given the MRI findings of an infiltrative mass and enhancement in multiple locations, an orbital tumor such as a meningioma or metastatic carcinoma should be considered.

2. **Orbital Inflammatory Disease** - The initial treatment with prednisone and assumption of orbital inflammation suggests considering conditions like orbital pseudotumor or other inflammatory causes.

3. **Cavernous Sinus Syndrome** - The involvement of the cavernous sinus on imaging aligns with this diagnosis, which can present with multiple cranial neuropathies and orbital symptoms.

4. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - Though less likely given the lack of thyroid history, thyroid eye disease can present with proptosis, restricted motility, and optic neuropathy.

5. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation (Orbital Pseudotumor)** - This non-specific inflammation would be on the differential, especially considering the lack of response to steroids.

6. **Lymphoproliferative Disorder** - The infiltrative nature on imaging could suggest a lymphoma or other systemic hematologic malignancy infiltrating the orbit.

7. **Metastatic Disease** - Given her past medical history, a metastasis to the orbit needs to be ruled out, particularly from sources like breast or colon cancer.

8. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)** - This can present with orbital masses and systemic vasculitis but would typically have other systemic symptoms.

9. **Infectious Orbital Cellulitis or Abscess** - Although sudden and progressive, the lack of fever and inflammatory markers makes this less likely but still possible.

10. **Optic Nerve Glioma** - This primary tumor of the optic nerve could explain the optic disc pallor and progressive vision loss specifically affecting the optic pathways.

### Reranked Final Differential Diagnosis After Full Patient Evaluation and Test Results

1. **Orbital Tumor (likely Meningioma or Metastatic Carcinoma)** - Considering the MRI findings and progressive symptoms localized to one side, this remains the top differential.
2. **Cavernous Sinus Syndrome** - The involvement of the cavernous sinus and related structures on MRI makes this a high priority diagnosis.
3. **Lymphoproliferative Disorder (Orbital Lymphoma)** - Serious consideration given the infiltrative nature and systemic implications.
4. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation (Orbital Pseudotumor)** - Still a consideration but less likely given high suspicion of a neoplastic process.
5. **Metastatic Disease** - Need to rule out metastasis, though history of colon polyps without known primary malignancy makes it less likely.
6. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - Unlikely given no thyroid history but would still consider due to proptosis and orbital signs.
7. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)** - Less likely without other systemic symptoms.
8. **Optic Nerve Glioma** - This condition remains possible due to specific optic nerve findings.
9. **Orbital Inflammatory Disease** - Less likely given poor response to steroids and specific MRI findings.
10. **Infectious Orbital Cellulitis or Abscess** - Least likely but still on differential due to rapid onset of symptoms, despite lack of fever or infection signs.","['External Eye Disease', 'Ophthalmology', 'Orbit']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,70.0,F

A 60-year-old man presented with a 1-week history of progressive painless diplopia. He had a history of hypothyroidism and dyslipidemia, for which he took levothyroxine and rosuvastatin. He reported no changes in visual acuity or color vision; no ocular pain, erythema, or abnormal discharge; and no headaches, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, ptosis, dysphagia, dysarthria, weakness, numbness, or ataxia. He did not have any constitutional or systemic symptoms. Physical examination showed an isolated limitation of right eye abduction. The remainder of the examination, including visual acuity, pupillary reaction, visual fields, and fundoscopy, was unremarkable. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the head showed abnormal thickening and T2 hyperintensity of the right lateral rectus muscle with T1-weighted gadolinium enhancement (Figure 1).

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Information and Test Results:
1. **Ocular myositis**: Given the isolated thickening and enhancement of the right lateral rectus muscle on MRI and the absence of systemic or infectious evidence.
2. **Thyroid eye disease (TED)**: Although the patient has hypothyroidism, TED often presents bilaterally and more commonly involves other ocular features such as proptosis.
3. **Orbital pseudotumor**: This can present with muscle involvement, but tends to have more acute onset with pain, which is not present here.
4. **Sixth nerve palsy**: Though this can cause diplopia, the MRI findings point more towards a muscular issue rather than nerve.
5. **Tolosa-Hunt syndrome**: Presents with painful ophthalmoplegia, which is not consistent with the painless presentation in this case.
6. **Diabetic ophthalmoplegia**: The patient does not have diabetes, so this is less likely.
7. **Neuromuscular junction disorders (e.g., Myasthenia Gravis)**: While this can cause diplopia, it typically affects multiple muscles and does not show muscle thickening on MRI.
8. **Lymphoma**: Involves muscle thickening, but absence of systemic symptoms and negative CT of abdomen and pelvis make this less likely.
9. **Infectious myositis**: Tests for infection were negative, making this less probable.
10. **Sarcoidosis**: This could potentially cause muscle involvement, but would more likely show other systemic signs, which are absent here.

5. **Disseminated tuberculosis:** Presenting in a high-risk population (incarcerated) with mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, weight loss, and pulmonary nodules.
6. **Histoplasmosis:** Endemic to Ohio and associated with bilateral pulmonary reticulonodular opacities and systemic symptoms in immunocompromised patients.
7. **Cryptococcosis:** Immunocompromised host with potential disseminated infection, presenting as pulmonary nodules and systemic symptoms.
8. **Lymphoma:** Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy in the context of HIV could suggest an AIDS-related lymphoma.
9. **Endemic fungal infections (e.g., Coccidioidomycosis):** Consistent with the geographic area and presenting with pulmonary nodules and systemic symptoms.
10. **Kaposi’s sarcoma:** Pulmonary involvement in an HIV-positive patient, though more commonly associated with mucocutaneous lesions.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

**1. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP):** The HIV-positive patient with a low CD4+ count and bilateral pulmonary findings is strongly suggestive of PJP, which is a common opportunistic infection.
**2. Disseminated tuberculosis:** The combination of immunosuppression, pulmonary symptoms, and lymphadenopathy necessitates consideration of TB, especially in a high-risk population (incarcerated).
**3. Histoplasmosis:** Endemic to Ohio and consistent with the pulmonary findings and immunocompromised status, histoplasmosis remains a strong possibility.
**4. Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection:** Immunocompromised state with systemic and pulmonary symptoms is compatible with disseminated MAC.
**5. HIV/AIDS:** The underlying cause of immunosuppression; the positive HIV-1 antibodies signify an advanced disease stage.
**6. Cryptococcosis:** Another opportunistic infection in HIV-positive individuals, which can present with pulmonary involvement.
**7. Lymphoma:** Particularly AIDS-related lymphoma could explain the pulmonary and systemic findings, especially with marked lymphadenopathy.
**8. Kaposi’s sarcoma:** Though more often mucocutaneous, pulmonary KS is a consideration in an HIV-positive patient.
**9. Endemic fungal infections (Coccidioidomycosis):** Less likely than histoplasmosis but still within the differential due to geographic overlap and symptomatology.
**10. COVID-19:** Based on initial presentation, though subsequently less likely given the negative PCR tests and positive HIV findings.","['Pulmonary Medicine', 'Radiology', 'HIV', 'Infectious Diseases']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,60.0,M

### INPUT:
A 58-year-old woman presented with a several-week history of a painless right-sided swelling on her anterior neck. She denied trauma, recent illnesses, respiratory symptoms, dysphagia, oral lesions, hemoptysis, fever, fatigue, weight loss, and night sweats. She had an unremarkable medical history without history of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, cancer, chemotherapy, radiation, or tuberculosis. She denied alcohol, tobacco, or current medication use. Her family history included a sibling with sarcoma in their 50s. On examination, a 4.0-cm mobile, nontender right lower anterior neck mass was palpated in a suprasternal location. No lymphadenopathy was noted. Laboratory results showed normal serum calcium levels and leukocyte counts. Initial ultrasonography showed a 4.2-cm solid nodule adjacent to the lower pole of the right thyroid. Computed tomography results of the neck showed a 3.4-cm circumscribed, heterogenous, hypodense, enhancing mass that was abutting the inferior right thyroid and at the right lateral margin of the trachea. The mass was just medial to the right common carotid, causing left lateral displacement of the trachea (Figure 1). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Thymoma,"### 10-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Thyroid Nodule**: The presentation of a painless swelling in the neck naturally leads to considering a thyroid nodule, given its adjacency to the thyroid gland.
   
2. **Thyroid Carcinoma**: Due to the presence of a solid nodule and the possible displacement of surrounding structures, malignancy must be considered.

3. **Parathyroid Adenoma**: While rare, parathyroid adenomas can present with a painless neck mass.

4. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**: This is a congenital anomaly that can present as a neck mass in adults.

5. **Lymphoma**: Although lymphadenopathy was not noted, some forms of lymphoma can present with non-tender, localized masses.

6. **Neurogenic Tumor**: Tumors arising from nerve tissues, such as schwannomas, can present similarly with a painless mass.

7. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**: This congenital condition can present with a painless midline neck mass, but it could be laterally displaced in atypical cases.

8. **Metastatic Lymphadenopathy**: Despite the absence of a primary tumor history, metastasis from occult primary cancers should be considered.

9. **Salivary Gland Tumor**: Tumors arising from minor salivary glands can present in a similar location.

10. **Infectious/Inflammatory Mass**: Even without systemic symptoms, chronic infectious or inflammatory processes can present as an isolated neck mass.

### Reranking Based on Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Thyroid Nodule**: Most consistent with a 4.2-cm solid nodule adjacent to the thyroid.
   
2. **Thyroid Carcinoma**: The hypodense, enhancing features, and the mass's size and effects on surrounding structures raise suspicion of malignancy.

3. **Parathyroid Adenoma**: Less likely due to normal serum calcium levels, but still a consideration given the proximity.
   
4. **Neurogenic Tumor**: Hypodense, enhancing masses in the described location could be neurogenic in origin.

5. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**: Typically presents in younger patients but is still a feasible differential diagnosis.

6. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**: Though typically midline, lateral dislocations and mass effects still make it a consideration.

7. **Lymphoma**: Despite no lymphadenopathy, the presentation in this age group and the solid nature of the mass make it reasonable to consider.
   
8. **Metastatic Lymphadenopathy**: Given the patient’s age and the solid nature of the mass, metastasis from an unknown primary cancer remains a differential.

9. **Salivary Gland Tumor**: Salivary gland tumors are less common but still possible given the location.

10. **Infectious/Inflammatory Mass**: Least likely given the chronic and less symptomatic nature of the swelling with no systemic signs.","['Radiology', 'Oncology', 'Endocrine Cancer', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Lymphomas']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,58.0,F

### INPUT:
An 82-year-old with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and history of past cigarette smoking presented to pulmonary clinic for evaluation of dyspnea that had worsened over the previous 5 years. Two years prior, he was diagnosed with a right lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolism on a computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram after evaluation of shortness of breath. Warfarin was initiated but discontinued after 2 months due to recurrent epistaxis. On presentation to the pulmonary clinic, the patient reported dyspnea with minimal activity, fatigue, lightheadedness, and leg swelling. His temperature was 96.8 °F (36 °C); blood pressure, 120/71 mm Hg; heart rate, 73/min; and oxygen saturation, 98% on room air. He appeared frail and had multiple telangiectasias on his lips, tongue, and hands. He had jugular venous distension, a cardiac systolic murmur, right ventricular heave, and bilateral lower extremity edema to the knees. Laboratory testing revealed brain-type natriuretic peptide level of 1333 pg/mL (reference, <100 pg/mL) and hemoglobin level of 12.9 g/dL (reference, 13.9-16.3 g/dL). During a 6-minute walk test on room air, his oxygen saturation decreased to 87%. With oxygen delivered by nasal cannula at 4 L/min, his oxygen saturation was 98%, and he walked 90 m (15% of predicted). An echocardiogram showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, moderate-severe right ventricular dilatation, and right ventricular systolic pressure of 60 to 70 mm Hg (reference, 35-40 mm Hg). Findings on an echocardiogram performed 10 years prior were normal. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH),"Based on the provided information, we need to develop a step-by-step differential diagnosis process. Each step will include only one possible diagnosis related to the patient's symptoms and history. After listing 10 differentials, we'll rerank them according to the patient's data and test results.

### Step-by-step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Pulmonary Hypertension**
2. **Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH)**
3. **Congestive Heart Failure (Right-sided)**
4. **Interstitial Lung Disease**
5. **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**
6. **Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia-related Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations (PAVMs)**
7. **Cor Pulmonale**
8. **Valve Disease, particularly Tricuspid Regurgitation**
9. **Anemia-related Dyspnea**
10. **Lung Cancer**

### Reranking based on All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Pulmonary Hypertension** 
   - Right ventricular heave, increased right ventricular systolic pressure, and moderate-severe right ventricular dilatation suggest pulmonary hypertension.
  
2. **Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH)**
   - History of pulmonary embolism and current symptoms strongly support CTEPH as a possible cause of pulmonary hypertension.

3. **Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia-related Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations (PAVMs)**
   - Given the patient's history of HHT and the associated risk of PAVMs contributing to hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension.

4. **Cor Pulmonale**
   - Right ventricular dilatation and the presence of jugular venous distention and lower extremity edema are indicative of cor pulmonale secondary to pulmonary hypertension.

5. **Congestive Heart Failure (Right-sided)**
   - Symptoms like dyspnea, leg swelling, and jugular venous distension are consistent with right-sided heart failure, likely secondary to pulmonary hypertension.

6. **Valve Disease, particularly Tricuspid Regurgitation**
   - Systolic murmur and findings of right ventricular dilatation could be associated with tricuspid valve disease.

7. **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**
   - History of cigarette smoking and the worsening dyspnea over years could fit COPD, although the pulmonary findings (normal oxygen saturation at rest and no mention of obstructive pattern) are less supportive.

8. **Interstitial Lung Disease**
   - The history and presentation are less suggestive, but needs consideration due to dyspnea and potential underlying chronic pulmonary process.

9. **Anemia-related Dyspnea**
   - The patient's hemoglobin is slightly below the normal range, but the level does not fully explain the severity of the patient's symptoms.

10. **Lung Cancer**
    - History of smoking raises the index of suspicion, but less supportive as primary diagnosis given current presentation and findings focused more on pulmonary hypertension and right heart involvement.

By reanalyzing all information, Pulmonary Hypertension stands out as the most likely diagnosis, followed by CTEPH and complications related to Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia, given the patient’s significant history and current presentation.","['Cardiology', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Geriatrics', 'Pulmonary Medicine', 'Venous Thromboembolism']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,82.0,M

### INPUT:
An 11-year-old boy with a medical history of allergic rhinitis presented to the emergency department of a children’s hospital with 2 weeks of painful left-sided neck swelling and fever. He had accompanying night sweats, fatigue, and decreased appetite. Initial physical examination revealed multiple distinct matted, firm left-sided cervical lymph nodes. Laboratory evaluation was notable for leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 3700/µL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 0.001), a microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10), mean corpuscular volume of 58 µm3 (to convert to fL, multiply by 1), an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level of 548 U/L (to convert to µkat/L, multiply by 0.0167), and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 35 mm/h. Purified protein derivative and infectious mononucleosis testing were negative. A contrast-enhanced neck computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple lymph nodes with areas of central hypodensity, and a conglomerate of heterogeneous lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (level 5B), measuring approximately 3.7 × 1.4 × 3.6 cm (Figure). The otolaryngology service was consulted, and a left level Va and Vb selective neck dissection was performed. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Lymphoma**  
Due to prolonged symptoms, multiple matted cervical lymph nodes, and systemic signs such as night sweats and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

2. **Tuberculosis (TB)**  
Given persistent lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms like fever and night sweats, even though the purified protein derivative test is negative.

3. **Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease**  
A consideration due to fever, night sweats, and cervical lymphadenopathy.

4. **Cat Scratch Disease**  
Presented with regional lymphadenopathy, fever, and history of potential exposure to cats.

5. **Sarcoidosis**  
Chronic, multisystemic involvement with lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms.

6. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**  
Systemic symptoms with hematologic abnormalities, including leukopenia and anemia.

7. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection**  
Causes prolonged fever, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and leukopenia.

8. **Toxoplasmosis**  
Chronic cervical lymphadenopathy with systemic symptoms like fever and night sweats.

9. **Leukemia**  
Systemic illness presenting with fever, leukopenia, anemia, and enlarged lymph nodes.

10. **Bartonella henselae Infection**  
Given its association with similar presentations in pediatric patients, particularly with negative results for other common infections.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Lymphoma**
   - Most consistent with imaging, prolonged symptoms, systemic signs (night sweats, fatigue, decreased appetite), and lab findings (elevated LDH, leukopenia, anemia).

2. **Leukemia**
   - Fits systemic symptoms, hematologic abnormalities, and the severity of the clinical presentation.

3. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection**
   - Can cause prolonged fever, lymphadenopathy, and hematologic abnormalities in pediatric patients.

4. **Tuberculosis (TB)**
   - Although the PPD test is negative, TB still remains a differential given the symptoms and imaging. False-negative PPD is possible.

5. **Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease**
   - Considered given fever, lymphadenopathy, and systemic symptoms, particularly in pediatric patients.

6. **Toxoplasmosis**
   - Chronic cervical lymphadenopathy with systemic manifestations fits the presentation.

7. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Multisystem involvement and lymphadenopathy align, but less likely than lymphoma or leukemia.

8. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
   - Systemic symptoms and hematologic abnormalities could point toward SLE.

9. **Bartonella henselae Infection (Cat Scratch Disease)**
   - Regional lymphadenopathy with systemic symptoms, but less likely considering the progression and severity.

10. **Cat Scratch Disease**
   - Considered due to regional lymphadenopathy, though less likely given the other more fitting differentials and severity.","['Otolaryngology', 'Pediatrics']",0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,11.0,M

    ",Cryptococcosis,"Alright, based on the initial presentation and patient history, I will outline a 10-step differential diagnosis process. Each step will focus on one disease hypothesis, and afterward, I'll rank them based on the given patient information and the potential relevance.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Kaposi's Sarcoma**  
   Given the patient's history of HIV and the presence of skin lesions (papules and nodules), Kaposi's Sarcoma is a strong initial consideration.

2. **Cutaneous Cryptococcosis**  
   HIV patients are susceptible to opportunistic infections including fungal infections like Cryptococcus, which can manifest as skin lesions.

3. **Histoplasmosis**  
   Progressive systemic fungal infections such as histoplasmosis could also present with similar dermatological and systemic symptoms.

4. **Bacillary Angiomatosis**  
   Bacillary angiomatosis, caused by Bartonella species, commonly affects immunocompromised individuals, producing vascular lesions that could resemble those described.

5. **Disseminated Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC) Infection**  
   MAC infections can cause widespread disease in HIV patients with low CD4 counts and may present with cutaneous symptoms.

6. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**  
   Chronic immunosuppression (like that associated with untreated HIV) increases the risk of skin cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma, which could present with nodular lesions.

7. **Leishmaniasis (Cutaneous)**  
   Immunocompromised individuals are at a higher risk of atypical presentations of infectious diseases like Leishmaniasis, which can manifest as papular or nodular skin lesions.

8. **Syphilis (Cutaneous)**  
   Secondary syphilis should be considered given the potential for systemic symptoms and diverse dermatologic manifestations in HIV patients.

9. **Molluscum Contagiosum**  
   This viral infection can present extensively in immunocompromised patients, leading to umbilicated nodules particularly on the face.

10. **Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma**  
    Although less common, this type of lymphoma can present with systemic symptoms and skin manifestations including nodules, particularly in immunocompromised patients.

### Re-Evaluation and Ranking Based on Patient Information:

1. **Kaposi's Sarcoma**  
   Very common in HIV patients, especially with facial nodules and a history of untreated HIV infection.

2. **Bacillary Angiomatosis**  
   Similar clinical presentation to Kaposi's Sarcoma; highly relevant in immunocompromised patients.

3. **Cutaneous Cryptococcosis**  
   Common opportunistic fungal infection in AIDS; nodular and papular skin lesion potential.

4. **Histoplasmosis**  
   Given the systemic symptoms and possibility of cutaneous involvement, this should be considered.

5. **Disseminated Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC) Infection**  
   Significant in advanced AIDS with potential for skin manifestations.

6. **Molluscum Contagiosum**  
   Facial nodules are characteristic, especially in severe immunosuppression, but less systemic involvement.

7. **Syphilis (Cutaneous)**  
   Secondary syphilis is highly variable and often includes systemic symptoms; should be on the differential.

8. **Leishmaniasis (Cutaneous)**  
   Less common but possible in HIV patients, especially if there is a geographical history to support it.

9. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**  
   Cutaneous malignancy more common in immunosuppressed individuals, but less likely acute systemic symptoms.

10. **Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma**  
    Rare but possible, especially with systemic and skin involvement in an immunocompromised setting.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 60s with previous breast carcinoma diagnosed 11 years prior, currently in complete remission, presented with pruritic lesions on her upper body. Physical examination revealed more than 10 monomorphous, 5- to 10-mm, pink papules with telangiectasias and white background on dermoscopy, distributed on the chest, arms, and back (Figure 1). There were palmoplantar keratosis and pits. The patient underwent thyroid ultrasonography, abdominal ultrasonography, colonoscopy, and central nervous system magnetic resonance imaging. These explorations revealed 1 Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) level 5 lesion, a kidney mass, and more than 100 colonic polyps. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cowden syndrome,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**: Given the patient's dermoscopic findings of pink papules with telangiectasias and a history of cancer, BCC is a primary consideration given its presentation.

2. **Cowden Syndrome (Multiple Hamartoma Syndrome)**: The combination of thyroid lesion, colonic polyps, and skin findings (palmoplantar keratosis and pits) fits well with this genetic disorder.

3. **Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)**: Considering pruritic cutaneous lesions and multiple organ involvement (though not classic in this case, NF1 can present with a range of features with skin findings and internal tumors).

4. **Muir-Torre Syndrome**: This is characterized by sebaceous skin tumors and internal malignancies, but can also present with colonic polyps.

5. **Gardner Syndrome**: A form of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) with extracolonic manifestations, including skin and bone tumors.

6. **Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome**: This is less likely but should be considered given the presence of multiple GI polyps, though typical mucocutaneous pigmentation is not described.

7. **Turcot Syndrome (Colonic Polyposis with CNS Tumors)**: Characterized by multiple colonic polyps and associated with CNS abnormalities. 

8. **Lichen Planus**: Characterized by pruritic, purple, polygonal papules but lacks the associated polyp and internal organ findings.

9. **Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)**: Given the numerosity of colonic polyps, could be considered, but typically doesn't include dermatologic findings described here.

10. **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)**: Sometime presents with skin manifestations and internal malignancies, though typically would expect findings related to blood dyscrasias.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis with All Information

1. **Cowden Syndrome (Multiple Hamartoma Syndrome)**: The constellation of thyroid lesion (TI-RADS 5), skin findings (papules with telangiectasias, palmoplantar keratosis), and over 100 colonic polyps highly suggests Cowden Syndrome.
   
2. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**: Skin manifestations alone could point to BCC but doesn't align well with internal organ findings.
   
3. **Muir-Torre Syndrome**: Multiple internal malignancies and skin features match well with this syndrome.

4. **Gardner Syndrome**: Polyp and skin findings are suggestive of this syndrome, though lacks typical osteomas and dental abnormalities description.
   
5. **Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)**: Less likely given no neurofibromas or Lisch nodules but still a consideration due to pruritic skin lesions and internal involvement.
   
6. **Turcot Syndrome**: CNS malignancy with polyposis can be a differential but skin findings are not commonly described.
   
7. **Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome**: Multiple gastrointestinal polyps indicate but typical mucocutaneous pigmentation findings absent.

8. **Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)**: Extensive colonic polyps align; however, no connected dermatologic findings.
   
9. **Lichen Planus**: Pruritic skin lesions but not supportive of internal findings.
   
10. **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)**: Skin and possible systemic malignancy connection, less likely due to lack of hematologic findings.

### INPUT:
A man in his 30s with AIDS presented with acute-onset painful scattered umbilicated papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the face, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A). The patient also had a new-onset cough but was afebrile and denied other systemic symptoms. Due to his significant immunocompromise, the clinical presentation was highly suspicious for infection. For rapid bedside differentiation of multiple infectious etiologies, a Tzanck smear was performed by scraping the base of an ulcerated lesion and inner aspect of a pseudopustule and scraping its base with a #15 blade. These contents were placed on a glass slide, fixed, and stained with Wright-Giemsa and subsequently Papanicolaou staining to further characterize the changes seen. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Mpox,"Let's go through the 10 steps of differential diagnosis systematically, considering the patient’s presentation, his immunocompromised status due to AIDS, and the results of the Tzanck smear and stains.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Kaposi Sarcoma** - This is a common AIDS-related malignancy characterized by vascular tumors that can present with skin lesions.
2. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection** - Tzanck smear can be indicative of HSV showing multinucleated giant cells.
3. **Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) Infection** - Similar to HSV, VZV can also present with painful vesicles and be detected by Tzanck smear.
4. **Molluscum Contagiosum** - This is a viral infection seen in immunocompromised patients with characteristic umbilicated lesions.
5. **Bacterial Skin Infection (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus species)** - Common bacterial infections which can present with pustules and ulcerated plaques.
6. **Fungal Infection (e.g., Cryptococcosis)** - This can present with skin lesions in immunocompromised patients.
7. **Bacillary Angiomatosis** - Caused by Bartonella species, this can mimic Kaposi sarcoma with similar skin manifestations.
8. **Histoplasmosis** - Disseminated fungal infection that may present with skin lesions.
9. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection** - CMV can cause skin lesions and similar histological features in immunocompromised patients.
10. **Syphilis (Secondary or Tertiary)** - Known to cause varied dermatological manifestations, including plaques and pustules.

### Reranking Based on Further Testing and Complete Information:

1. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection** - Given the acute painful papulopustules and Tzanck smear findings typically showing multinucleated giant cells, HSV is most likely.
2. **Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) Infection** - Similar lesions to HSV and also detected on Tzanck smear.
3. **Molluscum Contagiosum** - Umnilicated lesions characteristic in immunocompromised patients.
4. **Kaposi Sarcoma** - Typical in AIDS patients, but the acute painful onset is less common than HSV/VZV.
5. **Bacillary Angiomatosis** - Bartonella infection that can mimic Kaposi sarcoma.
6. **Cryptococcosis** - Disseminated fungal infection seen in AIDS.
7. **Histoplasmosis** - Signs are consistent with disseminated fungal infection seen in immunocompromised individuals.
8. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection** - Skin lesions are less common but can occur.
9. **Bacterial Skin Infection** - Presentations can be similar, but additional studies (e.g., cultures) would be needed for confirmation.
10. **Syphilis** - Can present with various skin manifestations, but other causes are more common in the context of AIDS and acute lesions.","['Dermatology', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine', 'Mpox (Monkeypox)']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30.0,M

### INPUT:
A 28-year-old woman presented with a 5-day history of painful cervical lymphadenopathy along with fever, nausea, and vomiting. Treatment with antibiotics and corticosteroids was started, without improvement of symptoms. She denied recent travel, sick contacts, or autoimmune disease. Her medical history was significant for α-thalassemia but otherwise noncontributory. On examination, she had tender lymphadenopathy involving right level V. A computed tomography scan of the neck revealed a collection of enlarged, matted nodes without evidence of an abscess. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy showed nondiagnostic reactive lymph nodes. She was subsequently admitted to the hospital, where the lymphadenopathy progressed to the left side of the neck and a skin eruption developed over her face, back, and trunk. Results of an infectious disease and rheumatological workup, including bone marrow biopsy, were negative. Given her persistent symptoms, the ear, nose, and throat service consulted for excisional biopsy. On pathologic examination, the lymph nodes showed extensive coagulative necrosis, apoptosis, and karyorrhectic debris (Figure 1). Cellular components included histiocytes and dendritic cells, with absent neutrophils and hematoxylin bodies. 
### OUTPUT:

6. **Toxoplasmosis**
7. **Cat Scratch Disease**
8. **Drug Reaction**
9. **Sarcoidosis**
10. **Tuberculosis**

### Reranking Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease (Necrotizing Lymphadenitis)** - Given the young age, cervical lymphadenopathy, fever, nonspecific skin eruption, and specific histopathological findings (coagulative necrosis, histiocytes, dendritic cells, absent neutrophils, and hematoxylin bodies), this diagnosis is highly suggestive.
   
2. **Viral Infection (e.g., Epstein-Barr Virus)** - Commonly presents with lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms. Although the histopathology isn't typical for EBV, it remains a differential given the clinical presentation.

3. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - The presence of lymphadenopathy and skin eruption could suggest an autoimmune process, though the absence of hematoxylin bodies makes this less likely.
   
4. **Lymphoma** - Persistent, progressive lymphadenopathy with systemic symptoms could indicate lymphoma. However, histopathological findings don’t suggest this as the primary diagnosis.
   
5. **Sarcoidosis** - Multisystem involvement is possible, but the typical granulomatous inflammation seen in sarcoidosis is not supported by the biopsy results.
   
6. **Bacterial Lymphadenitis** - Usually responsive to antibiotics and may present with abscess formation, which was not noted in this case.
   
7. **Toxoplasmosis** - Can cause lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms, but the histological findings don't strongly support it.
   
8. **Cat Scratch Disease** - Bartonella henselae infection causes regional lymphadenopathy; however, the patient’s lack of contact history with cats and the specific histologic findings make it less likely.
   
9. **Drug Reaction** - Could cause lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms, but would likely also cause eosinophilia, which was not mentioned in the biopsy result.
   
10. **Tuberculosis** - Typically causes caseating granulomas, which were not observed histologically.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the patient's history, clinical presentation, and biopsy results, **Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease** is the most likely diagnosis, followed by a possible viral infection or other lymphoproliferative or autoimmune conditions.","['Pain Medicine', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Antibiotic Use, Overuse, Resistance, Stewardship']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,28.0,F

### INPUT:
A woman in her 90s presented to the emergency department with symptoms of fever, hemoptysis, and syncopal episodes. She had a history of breast cancer and pulmonary nodules with biopsy findings negative for metastatic disease but positive for granulomatous inflammation. Initial vital signs included blood pressure of 103/66 mm Hg, heart rate of 190 bpm, and temperature of 38.7 °C. Electrocardiogram showed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with a morphology suggesting right ventricular (RV) origin (Figure 1). In addition to receiving intravenous amiodarone hydrochloride, she had correction of mild hypokalemia (3.1 mEq/L [reference range, 3.5-5.2 mEq/L]; to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 1.0). Successful arrhythmia termination occurred shortly thereafter, and her vital signs remained stable. Chest computed tomographic angiography excluded pulmonary embolism but showed pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy that had progressed compared with her previous computed tomography. An echocardiogram showed severe RV and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction with multiple areas of hypokinesis. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cardiac sarcoidosis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

**Step 1:** Tuberculosis (TB)  
**Step 2:** Sarcoidosis  
**Step 3:** Acute Myocarditis  
**Step 4:** Septicemia  
**Step 5:** Pulmonary Hypertension  
**Step 6:** Pulmonary Fibrosis  
**Step 7:** Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)  
**Step 8:** Endocarditis  
**Step 9:** Metastatic Lung Disease  
**Step 10:** Pneumonia

### Reweighted Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Sarcoidosis**
   - The patient has a history of pulmonary nodules with granulomatous inflammation, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and heart involvement, making sarcoidosis highly likely.

2. **Acute Myocarditis**
   - Given the severe LV and RV dysfunction with hypokinesis and ventricular tachycardia, myocarditis is a significant consideration.

3. **Tuberculosis (TB)**
   - The granulomatous inflammation and lung involvement also suggest TB, especially with fever and night sweats (as inferred from the multiple episodes of illness).

4. **Pulmonary Hypertension**
   - Severe RV dysfunction can often be linked with pulmonary hypertension; the mediastinal lymphadenopathy could be reactive or related.

5. **Septicemia**
   - The presence of fever and severe systemic symptoms could point towards a systemic infection, potentially leading to septicemia.

6. **Endocarditis**
   - The syncopal episodes, fever, and ventricular tachycardia could be secondary to endocarditis which can present with multiple systemic manifestations.

7. **Pneumonia**
   - With fever and lung involvement, pneumonia remains a practical differential even though nodular opacities may not be typical.

8. **Metastatic Lung Disease**
   - Although biopsy was negative, a new appearance and change in lymphadenopathy with severe cardiac involvement could still lean towards metastatic behavior, considering the patient’s cancer history.

9. **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**
   - Less fitting due to the specific cardiac and infectious markers absent in typical advanced COPD presentations.

10. **Pulmonary Fibrosis**
    - While pulmonary nodules and mixed lung pathology can appear, the acute infectious profile makes this less likely.

### INPUT:
A 27-year-old woman presented to her primary care physician with primary complaints of headaches and visual-spatial difficulties when driving at night. In addition, the patient described a progressively enlarging lesion on her left scalp, which she had initially noted in high school. She denied any overlying loss of hair, sharp pain, or bleeding from the scalp lesion, and she only reported pain with prolonged pressure. On her scalp examination, a 7-cm ill-defined spongy and pulsatile mass was noted with an overlying gray patch of hair. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain/orbit was initially performed (Figure, A and B), which demonstrated an ill-defined, diffuse, intensely enhancing scalp lesion in the left frontoparietal region with very prominent vascularity and underlying calvarial thickening. No osseous destruction or intracranial extension was present. Subsequent catheter angiography (Figure, C) confirmed the hypervascular mass, supplied via hypertrophied superficial temporal and occipital arteries with marked internal vascularity without direct involvement of the calvarium or intracranial structures. The patient underwent biopsy under general anesthesia; the specimen showed an ill-defined deep dermal/subcutaneous proliferation of spindle cells without significant nuclear pleomorphism or mitotic activity. The lesions stained positive for S100 and SOX10 immunostains. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Diffuse-type neurofibroma,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis
1. **Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans** - Consider this due to the presence of a progressively enlarging scalp lesion with spindle cells on biopsy.
2. **Neurofibroma** - The tumor's staining for S100 and SOX10 immunostains could suggest a neural origin.
3. **Scalp Hemangioma** - Considering the pulsatile mass and very prominent vascularity noted on the MRI and angiography.
4. **Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM)** - Due to the hypervascular nature of the mass without intracranial involvement.
5. **Epidermoid cyst** - Suggested by a slow-growing, well-circumscribed lesion, though not typically hypervascular.
6. **Leiomyoma** - Spindle cell component might suggest a smooth muscle tumor, often benign with dermal involvement.
7. **Lipoma** - Common, benign soft tissue mass, but typically not hypervascular and less likely to cause the described symptoms.
8. **Glioma** - Given the headache and visual-spatial difficulties, not usually presenting with a scalp lesion.
9. **Metastatic melanoma** - Could present as a scalp lesion with S100 positivity, though metastasis fits less with the detailed mass description.
10. **Soft tissue sarcoma** - Diverse group of tumors, S100 positive marking can be present.

### Re-Ranked Differential Diagnoses
1. **Neurofibroma** - The S100 and SOX10 positivity favors a neural origin, coupled with the described scalp and imaging characteristics.
2. **Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM)** - The vascularity and clinical presentation fit well with this diagnosis.
3. **Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans** - Despite S100 positivity, DFSP can present with spindle cells and progressive enlargement.
4. **Scalp Hemangioma** - Hypervascular nature and presentation consistent, but biopsy less suggestive.
5. **Soft tissue sarcoma** - Given spindle cell description and potential hypervascular features.
6. **Lipoma** - Not typically hypervascular but common and benign.
7. **Leiomyoma** - Unlikely given lack of hypervascularity on typical feature presentation.
8. **Epidermoid cyst** - Hypervascularity reduces this as a leading consideration.
9. **Glioma** - Unlikely to origin in the scalp and typically intracranial.
10. **Metastatic melanoma** - S100 positivity possible but less likely given the biopsy results and clinical presentation.","['Headache', 'Neurology', 'Pain Medicine', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuropathy']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,27.0,F

### INPUT:
A woman in her 30s presented for evaluation of asymptomatic erythematous scaly plaques over the face and proximal extremities. The lesions started as an erythematous papule on the face, which had progressed to larger plaques within 10 years. There was involvement of the upper respiratory tract, causing palatal perforation and stridor, necessitating a tracheostomy a year ago. In addition, there was history of wheezing and breathlessness. There was no history of preceding trauma, fever, malaise, joint pain, cough, epistaxis, hemoptysis, or hematuria. Examination revealed multiple well-defined brown erythematous scaly plaques with central scarring measuring 2 × 1 to 8 × 7 cm on the face, arm, and thighs. The patient also had saddle nose deformity, perforation of the hard palate, and necrotic plaques on the ear, causing destruction of ear cartilage (Figure, A and B). There was cervical lymphadenopathy: multiple, nontender, discrete nodes, ranging from 1.5 to 2 cm without any surface changes. The results of sensory examination and peripheral nerve examination were within normal limits. Respiratory examination and chest radiography results were normal. Hemogram showed anemia (hemoglobin, 10.1 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]); the results of a kidney function test, a liver function test, a fasting blood glucose test, and routine urinalysis were within normal limits. Serologic analysis results for HIV-1/2, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Punch skin biopsy was obtained for histopathologic analysis and culture (Figure, C). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Phaeohyphomycosis,"Sure, let's develop a 10-step differential diagnosis for this patient.

1. **Lupus Vulgaris**: The chronic progression of erythematous plaques, central scarring, and involvement of the face and extremities with necrotizing features are suggestive of a potential mycobacterial infection like lupus vulgaris.
2. **Sarcoidosis**: The presentation of erythematous plaques, lymphadenopathy, and respiratory involvement could also point towards sarcoidosis.
3. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE)**: The erythematous scaly plaques with scarring on sun-exposed areas fit the description of DLE.
4. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's)**: Given the saddle nose deformity, respiratory tract involvement, and necrotic lesions, granulomatosis with polyangiitis should be considered.
5. **Leprosy**: The presence of multiple well-defined plaques with no sensory or nerve impairment makes leprosy a consideration.
6. **Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma**: Chronic, scaly, erythematous plaques with a long-standing history can point to a diagnosis like cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
7. **Chronic Cutaneous (Discoid) Lupus Erythematosus**: The presentation could fit another subtype of lupus.
8. **Tuberculosis Cutis**: Cutaneous involvement presenting as chronic plaques and scarring may also suggest a cutaneous form of tuberculosis.
9. **Leishmaniasis**: The involvement of the face, destruction of cartilage, and non-healing ulcers could also suggest a chronic parasitic infection like leishmaniasis.
10. **Syphilis (tertiary)**: Necrotic skin lesions and palate perforation can be seen in tertiary syphilis, despite the lack of systemic symptoms.

To prioritize these diagnoses, we will incorporate the patient history, clinical examination, and initial diagnostic tests (normal kidney and liver functions, negative HIV, ANA, and ANCA).

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's)**: The combination of saddle nose deformity, palatal perforation, and necrotic plaques strongly suggest this diagnosis.
2. **Lupus Vulgaris**: Chronic, progressive plaques with central scarring and multi-system involvement.
3. **Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma**: The chronic, progressive nature of the plaques may also fit this diagnosis.
4. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE)**: The erythematous scaly plaques with central scarring on sun-exposed areas.
5. **Sarcoidosis**: Erythematous plaques with lymphadenopathy as a systemic inflammatory condition.
6. **Leprosy**: The chronic, well-defined plaques without neural involvement.
7. **Tuberculosis Cutis**: Chronic scaly lesions consistent with a TB infection.
8. **Syphilis (tertiary)**: Despite lacking systemic symptoms, it remains a candidate due to necrotic skin and cartilage destruction.
9. **Leishmaniasis**: Facial involvement and necrotic nature of lesions could be seen in chronic leishmaniasis.
10. **Chronic Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus**: Another form of lupus with similar plaque manifestations.","['Dermatology', 'Facial Plastic Surgery', 'Fungal Infections', 'Global Health', 'Infectious Diseases']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30.0,F

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy 13-month-old male was scheduled to undergo excisional biopsy of a left anterior tongue submucosal intramuscular mass (Figure 1). This firm-to-palpation mass was noted at birth and remained proportional in size with the child’s somatic growth, measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter on presentation. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) documented the mass to be uniformly solid and well circumscribed without cystic components or flow voids, hypointense on T2, and hyperintense with homogeneous contrast enhancement on T1. His head, neck, and general examination findings were otherwise normal with no cervical lymphadenopathy or additional masses. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Rhabdomyoma,"Certainly, let's proceed with a step-by-step approach to develop a differential diagnosis for this case. Each step will consider a possible diagnosis based on the patient's presentation and test results.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Rhabdomyoma**
    - Congenital rhabdomyomas often present as firm, well-circumscribed masses in the head and neck region, which can be seen in the tongue.

2. **Granular Cell Tumor**
    - These tumors are typically benign and present as submucosal masses on the tongue. They are often firm and well-circumscribed.

3. **Hemangioma**
    - Although this lesion is hypointense on T2 and hemangiomas often show flow voids, atypical presentations can sometimes confuse the diagnosis.

4. **Schwannoma**
    - Schwannomas can present as well-circumscribed, solid masses. They typically enhance with contrast on T1 images.

5. **Fibroma**
    - Fibromas are benign, often firm, submucosal masses that can appear in various parts of the oral cavity, including the tongue.

6. **Lipoma**
    - Lipomas are usually softer and not hypointense on T2, but there's still a slight possibility given the benign nature and presentation.

7. **Lymphangioma**
    - Lymphangiomas usually present in infancy and often in the head and neck region, but typically they show more cystic characteristics.

8. **Neurofibroma**
    - Neurofibromas can present in the tongue and, like schwannomas, enhance with contrast and can appear solid but are usually hallmarked by other systemic findings.

9. **Dermoid Cyst**
    - Though typically cystic, occasionally dermoid cysts can present with solid components on imaging studies.

10. **Myoblastoma**
    - Myoblastomas are rare tumors that could present as solid, well-circumscribed masses that enhance with contrast.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses Using All Information:

Based on the lesion being firm, uniformly solid, well-circumscribed, hypointense on T2, and hyperintense with homogeneous contrast enhancement on T1 images, and considering it's present since birth and has grown proportionately with the child:

1. **Rhabdomyoma**
2. **Granular Cell Tumor**
3. **Schwannoma**
4. **Myoblastoma**
5. **Fibroma**
6. **Neurofibroma**
7. **Hemangioma**
8. **Lipoma**
9. **Lymphangioma**
10. **Dermoid Cyst**

### INPUT:
A 13-year-old girl with a 7-day history of painless vision loss and central scotoma in her left eye was referred to the department of ophthalmology. Three weeks prior, she had presented with mild fever and flulike symptoms, associated with a severe frontal headache that was mildly relieved by analgesics. Her medical history was positive for relapsing urinary tract infections since early infancy without adequate follow-up. Findings of an ophthalmological examination 1 year prior were reported as normal. At initial examination, she was conscious but somewhat lethargic. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/80 OS. Pupillary light responses, extrinsic ocular motility, anterior segment biomicroscopy, and intraocular pressure were normal in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination revealed a bilateral sectorial macular star that was more extended in the left eye, with retinal veins slightly dilated and tortuous, attenuated arterioles, some juxta and peripapillary nerve fiber layer infarcts, and optic disc edema with marked papillary telangiectasia; in addition, some faint, small, tan-yellow dots were observed at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium in the posterior pole, some of them already grayish and with a hypopigmented halo (Figure 1). Optical coherence tomography displayed elevated optic discs and hyperreflective material in the outer plexiform layer temporal to the optic disc in both eyes and a macular neurosensory detachment in the left eye. Results of visual field testing were normal in the right eye and showed a central scotoma in the left eye. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Hypertensive retinopathy,"Sure, let's proceed step-by-step to formulate the differential diagnosis and then rerank them based on the patient information and test results.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Neuroretinitis (Bartonella Henselae infection)**: Considering the presentation with painless vision loss, central scotoma, and the macular star, this is a primary consideration.
2. **Multiple sclerosis**: Vision loss and scotoma, along with prior headache, may suggest optic neuritis secondary to MS.
3. **Neuromyelitis optica**: Presents similarly to MS but with optic neuritis being a dominant feature.
4. **Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION)**: Given the features of optic disc edema and retinal changes.
5. **Sarcoidosis**: Lethargy and systemic symptoms with optic disc swelling and retinal vasculature changes might suggest granulomatous inflammation.
6. **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: Can present with vision changes, particularly in patients with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections which might signal underlying systemic autoimmune disease.
7. **Infectious optic neuropathy**: Other infectious causes such as toxoplasmosis, syphilis might be involved.
8. **Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON)**: Though typically painless, genetic optic neuropathy could be considered.
9. **Optic neuritis secondary to a viral infection**: Previous flu-like symptoms and subsequent vision loss could indicate this diagnosis.
10. **Diabetic retinopathy**: Systemic findings should be considered, though her history doesn't specify diabetes, retinal findings could align.

### Reranking of Differential Diagnoses:
After synthesizing all patient information, symptoms, and test results:

1. **Neuroretinitis (Bartonella Henselae infection)**: Classic presentation with macular star, flu-like symptoms, and optic disc changes.
2. **Multiple sclerosis**: Vision loss with previous headache and systemic symptoms could suggest optic neuritis related to MS.
3. **Neuromyelitis optica**: Needs consideration in young females with optic neuritis.
4. **Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION)**: Matching the disc edema, but less likely in a young female.
5. **Sarcoidosis**: Fits systemic and ocular findings but less specific than neuroretinitis.
6. **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: Should be considered in systemic autoimmune context, especially with recurrent infections.
7. **Infectious optic neuropathy**: Needs exploration especially given her previous flu-like symptoms.
8. **Optic neuritis secondary to a viral infection**: Similar systemic and ocular symptoms outcome as neuroretinitis.
9. **Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON)**: Possible but less likely given acute presentation and systemic signs.
10. **Diabetic retinopathy**: Evidence does not indicate diabetes, but retinal findings should be reconciled.

### OUTPUT:
    ",Leishmaniasis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Pharyngitis**: Commonly caused by viral or bacterial infection, characterized by sore throat.
2. **Laryngeal Reflux (Laryngopharyngeal Reflux)**: Reflux of stomach acid affecting the larynx and causing sore throat without systemic signs.
3. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: A type of cancer that can occur in the throat, causing ulceration and persistent symptoms.
4. **Gonococcal Pharyngitis**: A sexually transmitted infection that can cause severe sore throat and ulceration.
5. **Herpetic Pharyngitis**: Herpes Simplex Virus causing ulcers in the oropharynx.
6. **Tonsilloliths (Tonsil Stones)**: Hard formations in the tonsils causing irritation and potentially ulceration.
7. **Oropharyngeal Candidiasis**: Overgrowth of Candida species in the oropharynx, leading to white patches and sore throat.
8. **Chemical Irritant Pharyngitis**: Exposure to irritants such as smoke or chemicals causing pharyngeal ulceration.
9. **Tuberculosis (Pharyngeal TB)**: Manifestation of tuberculosis infection in the pharynx, leading to non-specific sore throat and ulceration.
10. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**: A rare condition causing inflammation of blood vessels, presenting with ulceration in the oropharynx.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis after Considering All Information:
1. **Laryngeal Reflux (Laryngopharyngeal Reflux)**: Most consistent with chronic sore throat, cobbling, and thick mucus without systemic signs.
2. **Pharyngitis**: Common presentation, but viral or bacterial forms typically present with fever and systemic symptoms.
3. **Chemical Irritant Pharyngitis**: Given the thick mucus and ulceration, exposure to irritants could be plausible, especially without recent sick contacts.
4. **Gonococcal Pharyngitis**: Possible but less likely without noted risk factors.
5. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Persistent ulceration makes it a serious consideration but not the first assumption.
6. **Herpetic Pharyngitis**: Unlikely without systemic symptoms or vesicular lesions typically seen in herpes infection.
7. **Oropharyngeal Candidiasis**: Fungal overgrowth could explain symptoms, though typically oral thrush would be more diffuse.
8. **Tonsilloliths**: Would more likely cause tonsil-specific symptoms rather than uvular ulceration and midline sore throat.
9. **Tuberculosis (Pharyngeal TB)**: Rare and typically accompanied by more pronounced systemic signs.
10. **Wegener's Granulomatosis**: Least likely given the rarity and typically more systemic illness features.","['Dermatology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Infectious Diseases']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,62.0,M

### INPUT:
A 64-year-old man with a 2-year history of seizure disorder presented to the emergency department (ED) at an outside hospital with breakthrough seizures. One month prior to his ED visit, he had been treated with oral antibiotics when he presented to an urgent care center with left-sided otorrhea, otalgia, and hearing loss. In the ED, he denied headaches, fever, otalgia, otorrhea, or hearing loss. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with contrast showed diffuse enhancement and possible coalescence in the left mastoid process with adjacent dural enhancement and sigmoid sinus occlusion. He received intravenous vancomycin and cefepime and was started on a heparin drip before being transferred to our facility. On presentation at our facility, the patient appeared well with normal vital signs. There was no periauricular swelling or erythema. Otoscopic examination showed no inflammation of the external auditory canals, and the tympanic membranes were translucent without evidence of retraction or effusion. Computed tomographic venogram confirmed occlusion of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses, and computed tomography of the temporal bone showed coalescence of mastoid air cells with erosion into the sigmoid sinus. Mastoidectomy was performed for biopsy and culture specimens. Histologic findings from the specimens demonstrated cells with oval nuclei and abundant cytoplasm arranged in syncytial clusters with occasional whorls, pseudoinclusions, and psammomatous calcifications (Figure, A). Immunohistochemical stains were positive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and vimentin (Figure, B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Meningioma,"### Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Meningioma** - The histologic findings of syncytial clusters with occasional whorls, psammomatous calcifications, and immunohistochemical positivity for EMA and vimentin are indicative of meningioma.

2. **Cholesteatoma** - The coalescence of mastoid air cells and erosion into the sigmoid sinus could suggest a cholesteatoma, which can erode adjacent structures and lead to sinus thrombosis.

3. **Otogenic Abscess** - The history of otorrhea and mastoid process enhancement raises the possibility of an abscess originating from an ear infection.

4. **Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST)** - Confirmed occlusion of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses aligns with CVST, possibly secondary to infection or inflammation around the ear.

5. **Glomus Jugulare Tumor** - Known to cause erosion of the temporal bone and sigmoid sinus involvement, a glomus tumor can present with otorrhea and cranial nerve deficits.

6. **Metastatic Carcinoma** - The radiological and histological findings could be seen in metastatic disease to the mastoid and sinuses.

7. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's)** - Can present with sinus occlusion and mastoid involvement, though typically associated with other systemic vasculitic symptoms.

8. **Sarcoidosis** - Known for causing granulomas and sinus involvement, though less likely without systemic symptoms.

9. **Osteomyelitis** - Chronic infection could lead to mastoid destruction and involvement of surrounding structures.

10. **Lymphoma** - Potential involvement of the skull base and sinuses, though histologic features are less typical for lymphoma.

### Re-Ranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Meningioma** - Primary due to distinct histologic and immunohistochemical findings.
2. **Cholesteatoma** - Relevant due to mastoid involvement and adjacent structure erosion.
3. **Otogenic Abscess** - Consideration given the infectious history and imaging findings.
4. **Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis** - Important to consider given confirmed thrombosis.
5. **Glomus Jugulare Tumor** - Possible due to temporal bone erosion, though less common.
6. **Metastatic Carcinoma** - Less likely without a primary cancer history, but considered.
7. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - Possibility given sinus involvement, but lack of other symptoms.
8. **Sarcoidosis** - Lower likelihood without systemic findings.
9. **Osteomyelitis** - Potential due to chronic infection and bone involvement.
10. **Lymphoma** - Unlikely due to differing histologic features from those described.

The key final diagnosis should be **meningioma**, supported by the combination of histological features and immunohistochemical profile.","['Otolaryngology', 'Otology', 'Epilepsy and Seizures', 'Neurology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,64.0,M

A 53-year-old woman with a history of stage IVA1 (T4N1M0B2) mycosis fungoides presented with a new 1-month history of hyperpigmentation of the oral mucosa (Figure 1). Examination of the mouth revealed multiple coalescing painless nonpruritic black macules and patches on the tongue, roof of the mouth, and buccal mucosa. Examination of the skin was notable for erythematous and hyperpigmented patches covering 90% of the body surface area, consistent with her known mycosis fungoides. Other notable findings on examination were 1- to 2-cm lymphadenopathy in the bilateral inguinal folds and axillae. Review of systems was notable for fatigue.

1. **Melanoma**:
   Given the hyperpigmented oral lesions, melanoma, particularly mucosal melanoma, could be considered.

2. **Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma**:
   Oral carcinomas should be considered given the patient's history of cancer and new lesions in the oral cavity.

3. **Oral Lichen Planus**:
   Chronic immune-mediated condition that could cause hyperpigmented oral mucosal changes.

4. **Addison's Disease**:
   Systemic conditions such as Addison’s disease can present with mucosal hyperpigmentation.

5. **Kaposi Sarcoma**:
   Given the patient's history of immunosuppression from chemotherapy, Kaposi sarcoma is a possibility.

6. **Drug-Induced Hyperpigmentation**:
   Considering the multiple previous chemotherapeutic agents, hyperpigmentation could be due to medication side effects.

7. **Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome**:
   This genetic syndrome can present with mucocutaneous hyperpigmented macules, although typically other gastrointestinal manifestations are present.

8. **Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis**:
   This could present as patches in the oral cavity but typically would present with white lesions rather than black.

9. **Acanthosis Nigricans**:
   This condition usually affects the skin but could exceptionally present in mucosal areas and is often associated with malignancy and insulin resistance.

10. **Primary Oral Mycosis Fungoides**:
    Considering the patient's known history, a rare manifestation of mycosis fungoides in the oral mucosa could be possible though unusual.

### RERANKED Differential Diagnosis based on all patient information and test results:

1. **Drug-Induced Hyperpigmentation**:
   Given the temporal association with recent chemotherapeutic regimens (romidepsin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin), this appears highly likely.

2. **Primary Oral Mycosis Fungoides**:
   Considering the extensive cutaneous involvement and established diagnosis of mycosis fungoides, oral manifestations of the same disease must be considered.

3. **Addison's Disease**:
   Due to systemic involvement presenting with fatigue and mucosal hyperpigmentation, although less likely given the history.

4. **Melanoma**:
   The lesion's visual characteristics demand exclusion of melanoma as a diagnosis, though rarer than drug-induced causes.

5. **Kaposi Sarcoma**:
   The patient's immunocompromised status due to several cycles of chemotherapy could facilitate Kaposi Sarcoma, albeit less likely without characteristic lesions elsewhere.

6. **Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma**:
   Given history of malignancy and new lesions, although less likely considering the specific presentation without ulceration or pain.

7. **Oral Lichen Planus**:
   Possible but there are no other typical lichen planus signs or symptoms.

8. **Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome**:
   Least likely given the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms and later onset in life; typically congenital or earlier manifestation.

9. **Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis**:
   Low probability due to absence of white lesions or typical presentation characteristics.

10. **Acanthosis Nigricans**:
    Very unlikely due to rarity in mucosal areas and no concurrent evidence of insulin resistance or malignancy.","['Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Lymphomas']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,53.0,F

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 7-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital with 1 week of temperatures up to 40.2 °C (104.4 °F), productive cough, and lethargy, which did not improve after 3 days of oral cefuroxime. He lived in rural China and had close contact with dogs, cattle, and sheep. His blood pressure was 93/60 mm Hg; heart rate, 100/min; respiratory rate, 26/min; and oxygen saturation, 94% on room air. Lung auscultation revealed absent breath sounds on the right hemithorax. His abdomen was soft and nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly. His white blood cell count was 8000/μL, with 25.8% eosinophils (reference range, 0%-9%). C-reactive protein level and results from tuberculin skin test, interferon-γ release assay, nucleic acid amplification testing for tuberculosis, acid-fast bacilli smear microscopy, and HIV antibody testing were normal. A thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a ruptured 10 × 9 × 5–cm right upper lobe pulmonary cyst compressing the right main bronchus and 3 liver cysts (Figure 1). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cystic echinococcosis,"Based on the clinical presentation and test results, let's outline a differential diagnosis step-by-step:

1. **Echinococcosis (Hydatid Disease)**
   - This is especially likely given the rural setting, contact with livestock, eosinophilia, and evidence of cysts in the lung and liver.

2. **Paragonimiasis**
   - This could also present with pulmonary cysts and eosinophilia, particularly in individuals with a history of exposure to freshwater crabs or crayfish.

3. **Entamoeba histolytica Infection**
   - Known to cause liver abscesses and can occasionally affect the lungs; however, typically more common in regions with poor sanitation.

4. **Bacterial Lung Abscess**
   - Conditions such as Staphylococcus aureus or anaerobic infections could lead to abscess formation, but less likely with eosinophilia.

5. **Cystic Fibrosis**
   - This could present with lung cysts, although the demographics and eosinophilia make it a less likely initial diagnosis.

6. **Pulmonary Aspergillosis**
   - Could present with cavitary lung lesions, especially in individuals with immunocompromised status or chronic lung conditions, but less congruent with the full picture here.

7. **Lymphatic Filariasis**
   - This could explain eosinophilia and could potentially result in pulmonary symptoms, although not commonly associated with cyst formation.

8. **Tuberculosis**
   - Though many tests were negative, it should still be considered given the endemic nature in certain regions and possible atypical presentations.

9. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Could explain the pulmonary involvement but is typically without such marked eosinophilia and presentation.

10. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**
    - Could cause cystic lung changes but is quite rare and not a direct fit with eosinophilia and the patient's history/environment.
    
### Re-ranked Differential Diagnoses based on available information:

1. **Echinococcosis (Hydatid Disease)**
2. **Entamoeba histolytica Infection**
3. **Paragonimiasis**
4. **Bacterial Lung Abscess**
5. **Pulmonary Aspergillosis**
6. **Cystic Fibrosis**
7. **Lymphatic Filariasis**
8. **Tuberculosis**
9. **Sarcoidosis**
10. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**

Given the strong association with the patient's rural background, contact with livestock, and classical imaging findings, Echinococcosis (Hydatid Disease) stands out as the most probable diagnosis.","['Pulmonary Medicine', 'Hepatobiliary Disease', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Pediatrics']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7.0,M

### INPUT:
A previously healthy individual in his 20s presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of annular skin lesions that appeared first on his right ankle and then on other areas of his body over a 3-month period. He reported numbness and paresthesia in the areas of affected skin and an inability to fully extend his fingers. The patient did not take any prescription medications or herbal supplements and had immigrated to the US from Samoa 4 years prior. Physical examination revealed multiple tattoos and annular erythematous plaques on his face, chest (Figure, left panel), back, arms, and legs. The patient had bilateral palpable thickened auricular and ulnar nerves, claw-hand deformity (Figure, right panel), foot drop bilaterally, and decreased sensation to temperature over the areas of skin plaque. Results of testing for rapid plasma reagin, antinuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor were negative. Examination of punch biopsy samples from 2 plaques on his back revealed granulomatous periadnexal and perivascular dermatitis with diffuse granulomatous infiltrate and foamy histiocytes. Findings on acid-fast bacilli stains and mycobacterial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing were negative. Repeat biopsy of a skin plaque revealed no fungal organisms, and Mycobacterium leprae was not identified on Fite Faraco stain. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Multibacillary leprosy,"Let's work through a differential diagnosis in a step-by-step manner for this patient based on the provided clinical history, physical examination findings, and initial test results.

### Initial 10-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Leprosy (Hansen's Disease)**
2. **Sarcoidosis**
3. **Granuloma Annulare**
4. **Tertiary Syphilis**
5. **Rheumatoid Arthritis with Skin Manifestations**
6. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus**
7. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica**
8. **Cutaneous Tuberculosis**
9. **Erythema Multiforme**
10. **Tinea Corporis (Ringworm)**

Now, we rerank the differential diagnoses considering all patient information and test results.

### Analysis and Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Leprosy (Hansen's Disease)**
   - The patient's symptoms, such as annular skin lesions, sensory loss, thickened nerves, and claw-hand deformity, strongly suggest leprosy. Although initial tests for Mycobacterium leprae were negative, the patient's clinical presentation is highly indicative of leprosy, possibly in its tuberculoid or borderline form.

2. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Sarcoidosis can present with granulomatous inflammation and annular skin lesions. However, the specific neurological involvement and physical deformity patterns are less typical for sarcoidosis compared to leprosy.

3. **Granuloma Annulare**
   - This condition can present with annular plaques but typically does not involve nerve thickening or the specific neurological symptoms described.

4. **Cutaneous Tuberculosis**
   - Tuberculosis can cause granulomatous skin lesions, but the negative acid-fast bacilli stains and PCR testing make this less likely. However, it remains a consideration due to the granulomatous findings on biopsy.

5. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica**
   - This condition presents with granulomatous inflammation but is more typically associated with the shins and does not cause nerve thickening or sensory loss.

6. **Tertiary Syphilis**
   - Although it can present with cutaneous and neurological symptoms, the negative rapid plasma reagin test makes this diagnosis less likely.

7. **Rheumatoid Arthritis with Skin Manifestations**
   - This is less likely due to the negative rheumatoid factor and the specific skin and neurological symptoms which are not typical for rheumatoid arthritis.

8. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus**
   - The negative antinuclear antibodies test and specific symptoms make lupus less likely in this scenario.

9. **Erythema Multiforme**
   - This disease presents with annular lesions but typically follows an infectious trigger or drug exposure and does not cause nerve thickening or sensory loss.

10. **Tinea Corporis (Ringworm)**
    - Fungal etiology is less likely given the negative fungal stain and the presence of neurological symptoms.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided clinical information, a thorough examination strongly supports the diagnosis of **Leprosy (Hansen's Disease)**. Given the complexities and the possibility of negative initial tests, it is important to consider repeating tests or using additional diagnostic measures such as nerve biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.","['Dermatology', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Neuropathy']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,20.0,M

### INPUT:
A 3-year-old girl with no medical history presented to the emergency department with 1 day of abnormal gait and bilateral mydriasis. Two weeks prior, she had upper respiratory symptoms and bacterial conjunctivitis treated with topical ofloxacin. On examination, pupils were fixed and dilated to 8 mm, extraocular movements were intact, and fundus examination was normal. She had brisk reflexes, poor coordination, and a wide-based unsteady gait. Bloodwork revealed leukocytosis and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate; cultures remained without growth. Lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid studies, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbits were normal. The patient was discharged 3 days later following improvement in lethargy and gait with a diagnosis of acute cerebellar ataxia. When she presented to ophthalmology for 1-week follow-up, her visual acuity was central, steady, and maintained in both eyes. She demonstrated sluggish but reactive pupils and new-onset ophthalmoplegia. She was unable to move either eye in any direction, including with doll’s head maneuver. She was readmitted to the hospital and demonstrated diminished reflexes bilaterally and unsteady gait. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated diffuse enhancement of the lower thoracic and cauda equina nerve roots and enhancement of the left oculomotor nerve (Figure). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Miller Fisher syndrome,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)**: Given the history of preceding infection, fluctuating neurologic signs, including unsteady gait and diminished reflexes, GBS is a top consideration.

2. **Miller Fisher Syndrome (MFS)**: This variant of GBS often presents with ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and areflexia, matching many of the patient's symptoms.

3. **Bickerstaff Brainstem Encephalitis**: Similar to MFS but with additional brainstem involvement that can explain the enhancement of the oculomotor nerve.

4. **Acute Cerebellar Ataxia (ACA)**: Initially diagnosed with ACA, primarily due to ataxia and rapid symptom onset post-viral infection.

5. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)**: Considered due to the progression and chronicity of symptoms similar to GBS but over a longer term.

6. **Botulism**: Acute presentation with ophthalmoplegia, mydriasis, and lack of systemic infection signs could signal a neurotoxin, like that seen in botulism.

7. **Opsoclonus-Myoclonus Syndrome (OMS)**: Characterized by ataxia, myoclonus, and rapid eye movements; a similar presentation must be considered.

8. **Neoplastic Syndromes (e.g., Neuroblastoma with Paraneoplastic Syndrome)**: In a child with rapid onset of neurologic symptoms, a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with underlying malignancy is a differential.

9. **Brainstem Glioma**: Though less likely due to negative imaging, chronic progression without resolution should consider insidious structural lesions.

10. **Tick Paralysis**: Acute gait abnormalities and neurologic dysfunctions warrant checking for tick exposure.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on Additional Information and Tests

1. **Miller Fisher Syndrome (MFS)**: Combining ophthalmoplegia with reflex changes, MFS aligns well, especially with anti-GQ1b antibody testing if performed.
2. **Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)**: Given the preceding infection and nerve root enhancements seen in imaging, GBS remains high on the list.
3. **Bickerstaff Brainstem Encephalitis**: Mixed findings on imaging and neurologic exam suggest brainstem involvement.
4. **Opsoclonus-Myoclonus Syndrome (OMS)**: The unsteady gait coupled with potential paraneoplastic syndromes elevate its consideration.
5. **Neoplastic Syndromes**: The risk of a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with undiagnosed neuroblastoma in a child with new neurologic symptoms.
6. **Acute Cerebellar Ataxia (ACA)**: Remains a differential given the age and sudden post-infectious ataxia, though less likely due to recurring issues.
7. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)**: Slight possibility given prolonged worsening if the chronic phase is very early.
8. **Botulism**: Acute attack and neurologic presentation must not be overlooked despite other compelling diagnoses.
9. **Tick Paralysis**: Highly unlikely yet possible given acute neurologic decline.
10. **Brainstem Glioma**: Less likely due to normal initial imaging but could review if symptoms progress without clear etiology.

Careful correlation with detailed history, repeated neuroimaging, serologic studies and, crucially, perhaps nerve conduction studies/electromyography would be forthcoming to rule out or confirm top differentials.","['Demyelinating Disorders', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Pediatrics']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.0,F

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old man presented with a left shoulder mass. It began with a quarter-size maculopapular lesion and continued to progress during the next 3 years. He reported limited shoulder movements and denied other symptoms. There was no medical or surgical history, and he had a negative personal or familial oncologic history. The patient was a construction worker and used tobacco daily. On physical examination, there was a 24 × 15-cm fungating, necrotic, and ulcerated left shoulder mass (Figure 1A). A punch biopsy showed sheets of highly pleomorphic atypical spindle and epithelial cells within the superficial and deep dermis, extending into the subcutaneous tissue, and with 18 mitoses/mm2. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated SOX10-positive and pankeratin-negative tumor cells. A whole-body positron emission tomographic and computed tomographic scan revealed an intensely hypermetabolic left shoulder mass and multiple hypermetabolic enlarged left axillary lymph nodes, with no distant metastases (Figure 1B). Brain magnetic resonance imaging was negative for intracranial metastasis. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Melanoma,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Malignant Melanoma**:
   - Reasoning: The presence of SOX10 positivity, a protein often found in melanocytic tumors, supports the consideration of malignant melanoma.

2. **Pleomorphic Dermal Sarcoma**:
   - Reasoning: The appearance of highly pleomorphic atypical spindle and epithelial cells and pankeratin-negative status makes pleomorphic dermal sarcoma a potential diagnosis.

3. **Cutaneous Angiosarcoma**:
   - Reasoning: Given the necrotic and ulcerated nature of the mass, cutaneous angiosarcoma should be considered, especially given the aggressive nature of the mass.

4. **Spindle Cell Carcinoma**:
   - Reasoning: The spindle cell morphology and aggressive growth pattern indicate spindle cell carcinoma as another differential.

5. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma**:
   - Reasoning: Although rare, Merkel cell carcinoma presents as a rapidly growing cutaneous mass, though neuroendocrine markers would typically be involved.

6. **Desmoplastic Melanoma**:
   - Reasoning: Strongly suspected with SOX10 positivity and the aggressive growth noted in this patient.

7. **Atypical Fibroxanthoma**:
   - Reasoning: This neoplasm presents similarly on biopsy with pleomorphic and spindle-shaped cells and is common in sun-exposed areas, fitting the patient's construction background.

8. **Metastatic Disease (Unknown Primary)**:
   - Reasoning: No familial oncologic history, and negative primary findings elsewhere still leave the possibility of metastasis from an unknown source.

9. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans**:
   - Reasoning: Slow-growing cutaneous masses, though less aggressive than this presentation typically.

10. **Primary Cutaneous Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma**:
    - Reasoning: Manifest with large, ulcerative lesions and could mimic the presented symptoms.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Considering All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Malignant Melanoma**
   - Highest priority given SOX10 positivity which is consistent with melanocytic origin tumors.

2. **Desmoplastic Melanoma**
   - Specific subtype due to thickened, fibrous nature often found in such aggressive presentations.

3. **Pleomorphic Dermal Sarcoma**
   - High morphological variability and spindle cells fit the biopsy description.

4. **Spindle Cell Carcinoma**
   - Relevant due to spindle cell morphology and lack of other specific markers.

5. **Cutaneous Angiosarcoma**
   - Considered due to the mass's necrotic and ulcerated characteristics.

6. **Atypical Fibroxanthoma**
   - Relevant to pleomorphic and spindle-shaped cells but often less aggressive.

7. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma**
   - Rare but possible given the aggressive growth.

8. **Metastatic Disease (Unknown Primary)**
   - Possibility of a metastatic source considering the clinical presentation.

9. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans**
   - Typically less aggressive, but considered due to progressive growth.

10. **Primary Cutaneous Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma**
    - Relevant for large, ulcerative lesions but lower due to biopsy characteristics.

### INPUT:
A 6-year child presented with headache for 1 month and seizures followed by altered consciousness for 1 day. He had new-onset daily occipital headache for 1 month of mild to moderate severity and pulsating character. Occasionally, the headache became severe accompanied by vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. The child had 4 to 5 episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures 1 day prior to admission. He remained unconscious for several hours and spontaneously regained consciousness over 24 hours. There was no history of fever, weight loss, limb weakness, vision impairment, or any strokelike illness. His birth and developmental history were unremarkable. On examination, his pulse rate was 80 beats per minute (regular) with all peripheral pulses palpable without any radio-femoral delay. His blood pressure was 170/110 mm Hg with less than 10 mm Hg difference of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in other limbs. Abdominal examination revealed abdominal bruit. Fundus examination revealed papilledema with changes of hypertensive retinopathy. He was not oriented to place and time. The cranial nerves, motor, sensory, and autonomic system examination were unremarkable. Meningeal signs were absent. There was no evidence of neurocutaneous markers. His cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral white matter hyperintensity that was more marked in the bilateral parieto-occipital region. Ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a small right kidney and renal Doppler was suggestive of right renal-artery stenosis. His computed tomography angiography revealed short segment (3 cm) and short circumferential thickening of the descending aorta with right renal artery narrowing (Figure 1). His repeat cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed significant reduction in the white matter hyperintensities. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Takayasu arteritis,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Hypertensive Encephalopathy** - Given the child's severe hypertension, altered consciousness, seizures, and imaging findings indicating white matter changes, hypertensive encephalopathy is a primary consideration.

2. **Renal Artery Stenosis** - The ultrasound of the abdomen and Doppler findings suggest right renal artery stenosis, which could explain the severe hypertension.

3. **Takayasu Arteritis** - The short segment thickening of the descending aorta and right renal artery narrowing on CT angiography are characteristic findings.

4. **Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)** - The symptoms of headache, seizures, altered mental status, and imaging of white matter hyperintensities, especially in the parieto-occipital region, are consistent with PRES.

5. **Migraine with Aura** - The child's headache characteristics along with vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia could suggest a severe migraine with aura.

6. **Epileptic Syndromes** - Given the recurrent generalized tonic-clonic seizures, consideration of primary epilepsy or epilepsy secondary to a structural lesion should be included in the differential.

7. **Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)** - The one-month duration of headache, altered mental status, and white matter changes on MRI could suggest ADEM, although the lack of preceding infection or vaccination makes it less likely.

8. **Intracranial Mass or Tumor** - Although less likely given the imaging findings, a neoplasm causing increased intracranial pressure could present with headache, vomiting, seizures, and altered consciousness.

9. **Autoimmune Encephalitis** - The prolonged headache, seizures, and altered mental status could point to autoimmune encephalitis, though it is less common in the absence of other systemic symptoms.

10. **Vasculitis-related CNS Involvement** - Systemic or CNS-limited vasculitis could explain many of the child’s symptoms, including headaches, seizures, hypertension, and imaging findings.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Takayasu Arteritis** (Explanation: The combination of aortic thickening, renal artery stenosis, severe hypertension, and neuroimaging findings are most consistent with this diagnosis).
2. **Hypertensive Encephalopathy** (Explanation: Severe hypertension with encephalopathy and imaging findings consistent with white matter changes due to hypertension).
3. **Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)** (Explanation: Symptoms and imaging findings are highly suggestive but secondary to underlying hypertension or renal artery stenosis).
4. **Renal Artery Stenosis** (Explanation: The secondary hypertension due to renal artery stenosis causing central nervous system symptoms).
5. **Epileptic Syndromes** (Explanation: Seizures are a prominent feature, but likely secondary to the underlying hypertensive or PRES condition).
6. **Migraine with Aura** (Explanation: The headache characteristics fit, but the presence of severe hypertension and imaging findings make this less likely).
7. **Vasculitis-related CNS Involvement** (Explanation: The systemic findings and imaging can be seen in vasculitis but are not primary given renal artery stenosis and aorta thickening).
8. **Autoimmune Encephalitis** (Explanation: Possible but less likely due to lack of supporting evidence for autoimmune conditions).
9. **Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)** (Explanation: The imaging findings and clinical course could fit, but lack of preceding infection/vaccination makes it less likely).
10. **Intracranial Mass or Tumor** (Explanation: Least likely given the imaging findings and context of systemic hypertension).","['Pediatrics', 'Rheumatology', 'Neurology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6.0,M

### INPUT:
A 71-year-old woman presented to the otolaryngology clinic for evaluation of a parapharyngeal space (PPS) mass that was incidentally found on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the face. The patient experienced left jaw tightness, aural fullness, and facial discomfort. The MRI results demonstrated a well-circumscribed, ovoid mass in the left prestyloid PPS that measured 12 × 15 × 22 mm. The lesion was isointense on T1-weighted imaging, was hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging, and demonstrated heterogeneous enhancement following gadolinium administration (Figure 1). A computed tomography–guided fine-needle aspiration was performed, which demonstrated blood, fibrin, and rare mesenchymal cells. Given her ongoing symptoms, the patient requested surgical resection. The patient underwent transoral robotic surgery for resection of her PPS mass to achieve definitive diagnosis and treatment. Histopathologic evaluation demonstrated a well-circumscribed, 12-mm mass. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Venous malformation,"Let's go through a 10-step differential diagnosis process for the parapharyngeal space (PPS) mass in this 71-year-old woman:

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Pleomorphic Adenoma**:
   - Most common benign tumor of the salivary glands, can occur in PPS.

2. **Schwannoma**:
   - Benign nerve sheath tumor commonly found in the head and neck region and can present as a PPS mass.

3. **Paraganglioma**:
   - Vascular tumor that can occur in the PPS, often presenting with similar MRI characteristics.

4. **Neurofibroma**:
   - Benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor, although less common than schwannomas in the PPS.

5. **Lipoma**:
   - Benign fatty tumor, although these typically have distinct imaging characteristics (hypointense on T1-weighted and hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging).

6. **Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma**:
   - Malignant tumor of the salivary glands, can also present in the PPS.

7. **Metastatic Lymph Node**:
   - Secondary to a primary malignancy elsewhere in the body.

8. **Lymphoma**:
   - Can present as a mass in the PPS, often associated with systemic symptoms.

9. **Hemangioma**:
   - Vascular benign tumors that could explain the heterogeneous enhancement on the MRI after gadolinium administration.

10. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**:
   - Congenital epithelial cyst which could present as a well-circumscribed PPS mass.

### Re-ranking Based on Complete Clinical and Histopathologic Data

Given the patient information, MRI characteristics, and histopathologic results (well-circumscribed, 12-mm mass), the differential diagnosis should be re-ranked as follows:

1. **Pleomorphic Adenoma**: Common benign tumor, particularly consistent with the MRI and histological features.
2. **Schwannoma**: A benign nerve sheath tumor, also matching imaging characteristics.
3. **Paraganglioma**: Vascular nature could explain the heterogeneous enhancement.
4. **Neurofibroma**: Fits peripheral nerve sheath tumor characteristics but less common.
5. **Hemangioma**: Although benign, it typically presents more vascular characteristics.
6. **Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma**: Potential malignant tumor, important to rule out.
7. **Lymphoma**: Systemic disease presentation would typically have more widespread features.
8. **Metastatic Lymph Node**: Secondary consideration, contingent on other primary malignancy.
9. **Lipoma**: Less likely due to inconsistency with MRI characteristics (usually more fat signal).
10. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**: Unlikely based on the patient's age and histological findings.

### Conclusion:
The leading diagnosis after histopathologic evaluation most likely points towards a benign lesion such as Pleomorphic Adenoma or Schwannoma, which are the most common benign tumors presenting with such imaging and histopathological characteristics in the PPS region.","['Minimally Invasive Surgery', 'Otolaryngology', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Radiology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,71.0,F

### INPUT:
A 70-year-old woman with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and gallstones presented to the emergency department with 3 days of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. She reported no hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena and had no history of abdominal surgery. On admission to the emergency department, she was afebrile, her blood pressure was 80/60 mm Hg, and heart rate was 122/min. On physical examination, her abdomen was distended, tympanic, and slightly tender to palpation diffusely. Blood testing showed a white blood cell count of 10 450/μL (84.1% neutrophils); C-reactive protein level, 9.5 mg/dL; potassium level, 3.0 mEq/L (reference, 3.6-5.2 mEq/L); and creatinine level, 5.57 mg/dL (429.39 μmol/L, up from a baseline level of 0.80 mg/dL [70.72 μmol/L]). Sodium and liver function values were normal. In the emergency department, she received a 500-mL bolus of intravenous crystalloid fluid and 1 g of intravenous ceftriaxone.

3. **Acute Cholecystitis**
   - Relevant due to her history of gallstones and presenting symptoms of abdominal pain and nausea.

4. **Renal Failure**
   - Elevated creatinine level indicates acute kidney injury, potentially due to dehydration or shock.

5. **Pancreatitis**
   - Requires further investigation, especially with abdominal pain and vomiting.

6. **Perforated Peptic Ulcer**
   - Persistent vomiting and abdominal pain with no prior abdominal surgery might point towards a gastrointestinal perforation.

7. **Sepsis**
   - Unstable vitals (hypotension, tachycardia) with a high CRP level and slightly elevated white blood cells could suggest an infectious source.

8. **Ischemic Colitis**
   - Needs consideration given her age and underlying cardiovascular conditions.

9. **Hypokalemia-Induced Ileus**
   - Moderate hypokalemia observed and gastrointestinal symptoms could be related.

10. **Gastroenteritis**
    - Less likely but still a possible differential given nausea, vomiting, and diffuse tenderness.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis based on All Patient Information:

1. **Bowel Obstruction**
   - The combination of biliary fluid from the NG tube, distension, and the CT findings highly suggests this diagnosis.

2. **Acute Mesenteric Ischemia**
   - Strong suspicion due to severe abdominal pain and her history of atrial fibrillation, a known risk factor for embolic events.

3. **Acute Cholecystitis**
   - Given her history of gallstones and the computed tomography indicating possible gallbladder involvement.

4. **Sepsis**
   - The presence of unstable vitals, high CRP, and the need for intravenous antibiotics suggest a systemic infection.

5. **Renal Failure**
   - Significant increase in creatinine indicating acute kidney injury, directly pertinent to her clinical presentation.

6. **Ischemic Colitis**
   - Age and cardiovascular comorbidities raise this higher on the differential list.

7. **Hypokalemia-Induced Ileus**
   - Moderate hypokalemia associated with gastrointestinal motility issues.

8. **Pancreatitis**
   - Needs more diagnostic clarity but remains on the differential list.

9. **Perforated Peptic Ulcer**
   - The presentation does not strongly favor this over other higher-ranked diagnoses but remains a consideration.

10. **Gastroenteritis**
    - Least likely, given the lack of infection symptoms and the acuity of the presentation.

Note that while reranking, the computed tomography findings would have to be interpreted to tailor the differential diagnosis accurately.

### INPUT:
A 75-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with isolated deletion 5q (del5q) presented with multiple nonhealing skin ulcers on the chest and upper extremities. Four years earlier, he started taking lenalidomide, 10 mg/d (28-day cycle), to treat worsening anemia; after 2 cycles of treatment, he became transfusion independent. Since then, he has remained stable with the same dose and schedule of lenalidomide without significant adverse effects. The presenting skin lesions developed 1 month before presentation and began as small pustules that rapidly transformed into painful ulcers. He was treated with valacyclovir for a presumed diagnosis of shingles, but the lesions did not improve. Because of suspected necrotizing fasciitis, he underwent incision and drainage of the lesions. Cultures from the surgical specimen grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus. However, the lesions continued to worsen despite vancomycin and additional debridement. Thus, he was transferred to our facility. Physical examination showed multiple cutaneous ulcers with gray undermined borders and red papules of varying depths involving the chest, back, and upper extremity; lesions were as large as 9 × 15 cm. A complete blood cell count showed a white blood cell count of 16.2 × 103/μL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 1.0) with an absolute neutrophil count of 12.7 × 103/μL, hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), and platelet count of 262 × 103/μL with no circulating blasts. Results of additional laboratory studies, including blood culture and tests for herpes zoster virus (via polymerase chain reaction), antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were all negative. Additionally, the patient also had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for which he was taking lisinopril and simvastatin, respectively. Pathologic sampling from skin lesions demonstrated a dense dermal infiltrate with predominantly neutrophils along with reactive histiocytes, fibroblasts, and angioplasia (Figure, A). Immunohistochemical staining showed myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils (Figure, B), histiocytic markers (CD43, CD63, CD168), and CD117-positive mast cells, but no immature myeloid precursors. Results of Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver staining were unremarkable.

1. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**
2. **Sweet Syndrome (Acute Febrile Neutrophilic Dermatosis)**
3. **Cutaneous Vasculitis**
4. **Infectious Ecthyma Gangrenosum**
5. **Bullous Pemphigoid**

7. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma**
8. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica**
9. **Cryoglobulinemia-associated Ulcers**
10. **Paraneoplastic Pemphigus**

### Reranking with All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum** - Given the chronicity, rapid ulcerative transformation, neutrophilic infiltration on biopsy, and poor response to antibiotics, this autoimmune condition is the most likely diagnosis.
  
2. **Sweet Syndrome (Acute Febrile Neutrophilic Dermatosis)** - Consistent with neutrophilic infiltrate and associated with hematologic disorders like MDS, but typically presents with febrile illness which is not described.

3. **Cutaneous Vasculitis** - Although the biopsy findings and clinical presentation could be consistent, the lack of systemic vasculitis symptoms and negative autoimmune markers make this less likely.

4. **Infectious Ecthyma Gangrenosum** - Usually linked with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, not Staphylococcus hemolyticus, and typically seen in immunocompromised patients.

5. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma** - The chronic skin lesions could match, but the biopsy did not show findings consistent with this diagnosis.

6. **Bullous Pemphigoid** - The ulcerative nature and biopsy findings do not strongly support this diagnosis over inflammatory or vasculitic conditions.

7. **Extravasating Drug Reaction** - Given the stability of the patient’s medication regimen and the characteristic features seen on biopsy not matching common drug reactions, this is less likely.

8. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica** - Generally associated with diabetes mellitus, characterized by atrophic, shiny plaques not matching the presentation.

9. **Cryoglobulinemia-associated Ulcers** - The biopsy findings, lack of typical purpuric lesions, and negative serologies make this diagnosis less likely.

10. **Paraneoplastic Pemphigus** - Given his history of MDS, malignancy could be considered, yet the presentation and biopsy findings strongly point towards neutrophilic dermatoses instead.

### Conclusion
The patient’s clinical presentation and histopathologic findings most strongly support a diagnosis of Pyoderma Gangrenosum, a rare, non-infectious, inflammatory neutrophilic dermatosis often associated with systemic disease such as MDS.","['Dermatology', 'Cutaneous Drug Reactions', 'Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology', 'Hematology', 'Oncology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,75.0,M

### INPUT:
A healthy, uncircumcised man in his 30s presented with a 14-year history of dyspareunia and recurrent, purulent discharge from his penis. He had undergone multiple evaluations by dermatologists and urologists and had not responded to systemic antibiotics and topical corticosteroids. Physical examination revealed an erythematous, pinpoint orifice on his glans penis, with peripheral telangiectasias and a linear bluish structure on dermoscopy (Figure, A and B). Ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic focal zone on the right side of the glans, with multiple hyperechoic bilaminar structures (Figure, C). A biopsy was performed (Figure, D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pilonidal sinus,"Based on the provided patient history and diagnostic findings, a differential diagnosis can be approached step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Urethral Stricture**:
   Chronic inflammation or repeated infections could lead to a narrowing of the urethra, potentially explaining the dyspareunia and recurrent discharge.

2. **Chronic Balanitis**:
   This could cause persistent erythema and associated discomfort, though topical corticosteroids and systemic antibiotics would typically offer some relief.

3. **Lichen Sclerosus et Atrophicus (LSA)**:
   A chronic inflammatory condition that affects the glans, causing telangiectasias and fibrosis.

4. **Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection**:
   Chronic HPV-related lesions might present similarly with recurrent discharge and erythematous changes.

5. **Primary Syphilis**:
   Syphilis can sometimes present with ulcerative and erythematous lesions, along with nonspecific urethral discharge.

6. **Chronic Prostatitis**:
   Although it primarily affects the prostate, it can present with penile discharge and pain during intercourse.

7. **Penile Carcinoma**:
   A rare but serious condition that can present with erythema, discharge, and potentially telangiectasias or other abnormal findings on dermoscopy and biopsy.

8. **Condyloma Acuminatum**:
   Caused by HPV, may present with exophytic lesions and discharges.

9. **Urethral Diverticulum**:
   An outpouching along the urethra that may cause recurrent infections and discharge.

10. **Fistula**:
    An abnormal connection between the urethra and the skin surface, which could lead to persistent discharge and recurring infections.

### Re-ranking based on complete patient information and test results:

1. **Urethral Diverticulum**: The pinpoint orifice and recurrent discharge strongly suggest this diagnosis.
2. **Urethral Stricture**: Chronic inflammation or trauma could lead to this presentation.
3. **Chronic Balanitis**: Common in uncircumcised males, though typically responsive to treatment.
4. **Penile Carcinoma**: Serious consideration given non-responsiveness to conventional treatment and presentation.
5. **Fistula**: The presence of a persistent discharge and orifice might point towards an abnormal connection.
6. **Lichen Sclerosus et Atrophicus (LSA)**: Chronic inflammation and telangiectasias support this, but typically some improvement with corticosteroids would be expected.
7. **Chronic Prostatitis**: Less likely but considered due to pain and discharge.
8. **Condyloma Acuminatum**: Lesions from HPV could be a factor though not as likely.
9. **Primary Syphilis**: Considered less likely without systemic symptoms or more characteristic lesions.
10. **HPV infection**: Chronic HPV-related lesions could present similarly but would typically have different morphological findings.","['Dermatology', 'Urology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30.0,M

### INPUT:
A 62-year-old patient presented to the ophthalmology department with sudden painless vision loss in her right eye that occurred 24 hours ago. She also reported a 4-week history of right ear pain and fullness, discomfort over her frontal and maxillary sinuses, and nasal congestion without discharge. Over the past 2 weeks, she had experienced drenching night sweats, cramps in her quadriceps, and weight loss of 3 kg. She denied respiratory symptoms, headaches, scalp tenderness, or jaw claudication. She took no regular medication and did not smoke. At presentation, her visual acuities were perception of light OD and 20/20 OS. There was a right relative afferent pupillary defect. Dilated fundus examination showed a cherry red spot in the right macula with hyperreflectivity and thickening of the inner retinal layers on optical coherence tomography (Figure 1A and B). External eye examination results and ocular motility were normal. Examination by an otolaryngologist revealed normal tympanic membranes and a dry but otherwise normal nasal mucosa on flexible endoscopy. Blood tests showed leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 15 000 /µL; to convert to 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) with neutrophilia (white blood cell count, 12 500 /µL), elevated C-reactive protein (19.4 mg/dL; to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10), elevated plasma viscosity (2.06 mPas), and thrombocytosis (467 ×103/µL; to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 1). Kidney function was within normal limits. Chest radiograph results were unremarkable. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Granulomatosis with polyangiitis,"Let's proceed with a step-by-step differential diagnosis approach and subsequent re-ranking based on available information:

### Differential Diagnosis Steps
1. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)** 
   - Sudden painless vision loss and cherry red spot on fundoscopy.

2. **Giant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis)**
   - Age, sudden vision loss, elevated CRP, thrombocytosis.

3. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener Granulomatosis)**
   - Sinus symptoms, systemic symptoms, elevated markers of inflammation.

4. **Relapsing Polychondritis**
   - Ear pain, nasal involvement, elevated inflammatory markers.

5. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome (IOIS)**
   - Eye symptoms, systemic inflammatory signs.

6. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Systemic involvement, granulomatous inflammation affecting multiple organs.

7. **Primary Central Nervous System Vasculitis**
   - Sudden vision loss, systemic inflammatory symptoms, elevated CRP.

8. **Antiphospholipid Syndrome**
   - Thrombosis leading to retinal artery occlusion, systemic inflammatory markers.

9. **Lymphoma (Ocular or Sinonasal)**
   - Sudden vision loss, systemic symptoms like weight loss, night sweats.

10. **Infectious Endocarditis**
    - Systemic symptoms, elevated inflammatory markers, potential embolic event to retina.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis List
1. **Giant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis)**
   - Highly likely due to the age group, sudden vision loss, elevated CRP, and thrombocytosis.
 
2. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)**
   - Sudden painless vision loss and cherry red spot; consideration alongside underlying causes like embolic event.
 
3. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener Granulomatosis)**
   - Sinus symptoms, systemic symptoms, and significant inflammatory markers.
 
4. **Lymphoma (Ocular or Sinonasal)**
   - Systemic symptoms including night sweats, weight loss; should be ruled out due to serious nature.
 
5. **Relapsing Polychondritis**
   - Involvement of ear and nasal symptoms with systemic inflammation; fits well with described symptoms.
 
6. **Primary Central Nervous System Vasculitis**
   - Sudden vision loss alongside systemic inflammatory markers; needs consideration.
 
7. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome (IOIS)**
   - Localized to eye with systemic inflammatory signs; less specific systemic involvement.
 
8. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Granulomatous inflammation could explain multisystem involvement, though less specific for ocular sudden vision loss.
 
9. **Antiphospholipid Syndrome**
   - Consider if coagulation issues suspected, retinal artery occlusion potential.
 
10. **Infectious Endocarditis**
    - Should be kept in mind due to systemic symptoms and elevated inflammatory markers, though rare presentation.

### INPUT:
A 25-month-old child with unilateral hearing loss was referred to a pediatric ear, nose, and throat surgeon in a secondary care hospital. Clinical findings suggested unilateral right middle ear effusion associated with ipsilateral conductive hearing loss. After an initial observation period, a right tympanostomy tube was inserted. During the procedure, a clear liquid pulsating from the middle ear was noted, and samples were sent for β-2-transferrine analysis. This confirmed the presence of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. The patient was referred to our tertiary referral center hospital. The leak settled with conservative management, and imaging of the brain and skull base was performed. A high-resolution computed tomography scan of the temporal bone showed a lytic aspect of the right temporal bone extending to the petrous apex and the petrous bone, sparing the otic capsule (Figure 1A). There was soft tissue opacification of the right mastoid air cells. Magnetic resonance imaging of the skull base with contrast was performed (Figure 1B). It showed a hyperintense T2 signal in the petrous apex and mastoid air cells. There was a suspected communication into the soft tissues of the right neck in the posterior triangle. Magnetic resonance imaging also showed signs of Chiari malformation type 1. After a skull base multidisciplinary discussion, the patient underwent a bone biopsy through a transmastoid approach. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Gorham-Stout disease,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Cholesteatoma** - Given the soft tissue opacification and bone erosion on CT.
2. **Congenital Cholesteatoma** - Considering the patient's age and the noted bone erosion.
3. **Petrous Apex Cholesterol Granuloma** - Hyperintense T2 signal in the petrous apex is characteristic.
4. **Otitis Media with Effusion** - Initial finding of middle ear effusion.
5. **Temporal Bone Fracture** - Presence of lytic aspect and CSF leak.
6. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - Erosion of the temporal bone.
7. **Paraganglioma** - Possible pulsatile clear fluid and soft tissue mass.
8. **Meningoencephalocele** - Considering the CSF leak observed.
9. **Skull Base Tumor** - Considering the extensive lytic lesions.
10. **Chiari Malformation Type 1 Consequence** - Chiari could be indirectly responsible due to hydrocephalus causing CSF leak.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Petrous Apex Cholesterol Granuloma** - Hyperintense on T2 MRI, lytic bone changes typical of this diagnosis.
2. **Congenital Cholesteatoma** - Given the patient's age, unilateral presentation, and bone erosion.
3. **Cholesteatoma** - Chronic ear disease causing bone erosion and effusion.
4. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - Rare, but can cause lytic lesions in temporal bone.
5. **Skull Base Tumor** - Due to complex and extensive nature of lesion.
6. **Paraganglioma** - Possible vascular mass with bone involvement.
7. **Meningoencephalocele** - Consistent with CSF leak and bony defect.
8. **Temporal Bone Fracture** - CSF leak and bone erosion could be post-traumatic despite clinical presentation.
9. **Chiari Malformation Type 1 Consequence** - Indirect but possible due to increased intracranial pressure and CSF leak dynamics.
10. **Otitis Media with Effusion** - Initial, relatively benign diagnosis before more complex findings were revealed by imaging and biopsy.","['Otolaryngology', 'Pediatrics', 'Otology', 'Audiology and Hearing']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1.0,U

### INPUT:
A man in his 60s with no significant medical history presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of a gray-white plaque on his soft palate. These findings developed over the prior week and did not improve after treatment with 3 days of oral cefuroxime. The patient reported no sore throat, dysphagia, hoarse voice, cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, headache, fever, night sweats, weight loss, rash, or genital, rectal, or oral ulcers over the past 6 months. He was taking no regular daily medications, did not smoke cigarettes, and had no history of oral trauma. Over the prior 6 months, he reported sexual contact with 1 male partner. Physical examination revealed irregular gray-white ulcers with a surrounding erythema on the soft palate, uvula, and tonsils (Figure 1) and nontender bilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy. His tongue was of normal appearance, and he had no skin lesions or mucosal erosions in the anal or genital areas. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Secondary syphilis,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Primary Syphilis**
   - Given the recent sexual contact with a male partner and the presentation of oral lesions, primary syphilis must be considered.

2. **Oral Candidiasis**
   - This is a common cause of gray-white plaques in the oral cavity, though typically not described as 'ulcers'.

3. **Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection**
   - HIV can present with various oral lesions and should be considered, especially when oral ulcers or thrush are present.

4. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**
   - Oral cancers can present with non-healing ulcers.

5. **Aphthous Stomatitis**
   - Recurrent oral ulcers are a common presentation, although typically more painful than reported.

6. **Lichen Planus**
   - This chronic mucocutaneous condition can present with gray-white plaques.

7. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**
   - This autoimmune condition often presents with painful ulcers in the oral cavity.

8. **Erythema Multiforme**
   - Could present with target lesions or mucosal involvement.

9. **Lupus Erythematosus**
   - This systemic autoimmune condition can present with oral ulcers.

10. **Infectious Mononucleosis**
    - Caused by EBV, it can present with various oral manifestations including ulcers.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Primary Syphilis**
   - The sexual history, combined with the characteristic oral lesions and lymphadenopathy, strongly suggests syphilis.

2. **Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection**
   - Should be considered early due to the associated oral manifestations and the importance of early detection.

3. **Oral Candidiasis**
   - Though the patient's history of no antibiotic or immunocompromised state reduces likelihood, it should still be considered.

4. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**
   - Non-healing oral lesions in an older patient should prompt consideration of malignancy.

5. **Lichen Planus**
   - Presents with characteristic gray-white plaques and can be confused with other conditions.

6. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**
   - The description of the lesions and clinical presentation could fit pemphigus vulgaris.

7. **Erythema Multiforme**
   - Considered due to the possibility of mucosal involvement.

8. **Aphthous Stomatitis**
   - Less likely due to lack of pain and chronic nature of aphthous ulcers.

9. **Lupus Erythematosus**
   - Considered for its ability to cause oral ulcers, though typically ruled out with absence of other systemic symptoms.

10. **Infectious Mononucleosis**
    - Less likely given the absence of systemic symptoms typically seen with EBV infection.

### INPUT:
A 12-year-old girl presented to the clinic with a 3-month history of intermittent stridor. Her symptoms were initially most prominent while playing sports and were suspected to be due to asthma or seasonal allergies. However, medical management with albuterol, intranasal fluticasone, and cetirizine failed to provide relief. More recently, the patient’s parents noted that she developed stridor while sleeping and while at rest, prompting the family to present for medical attention. Previous workup, including pulmonary function testing, was concerning for an upper airway obstructive process, for which she was referred to otolaryngology. In-office flexible videostroboscopy revealed a mass in the distal cervical trachea that appeared nearly obstructive. Chest radiography confirmed the presence of an approximately 1.5-cm, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass within the cervical trachea. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. This demonstrated an exophytic, pedunculated mass that emanated from the anterior wall of the cervical trachea (Figure 1A and B). The patient was intubated via Seldinger technique to bypass the mass, with a 4.0-mm cuffed endotracheal tube loaded over a 0-degree Hopkins endoscope (Figure 1C). With the airway secured, attention was turned to excision of the mass. Lidocaine, 1%, with epinephrine 1:100 000 was injected in a submucosal plane, and laryngeal scissors were used to excise the attachment of the mass from the tracheal wall. The mass was then resected en bloc and removed with laryngeal cupped forceps. The attachment site was then ablated with the Coblator (Figure 1D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Schwannoma,"### 10-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Asthma**
   - Initial consideration given the history of intermittent stridor while playing sports, but medical management was unsuccessful.

2. **Seasonal Allergies**
   - Considered due to symptoms initially improving with standard allergy treatments but later worsening.

3. **Vocal Cord Dysfunction**
   - Considered given the stridor, but a mass was observed instead.

4. **Laryngomalacia**
   - Common cause of stridor but typically presents in infants.

5. **Tracheomalacia**
   - Considered due to upper airway obstruction but confirmed by imaging and visualization to be a mass.

6. **Subglottic Stenosis**
   - Would involve a narrowing of the airway, but visualization revealed a distinct mass instead of stenosis.

7. **Laryngeal Papillomatosis**
   - Multiple papillary tumors generally, but single, well-circumscribed mass not consistent with papillomatosis.

8. **Hemangioma**
   - Vascular tumors that can present as a mass but histological examination would differentiate them.

9. **Tracheal Tumors (Carcinoma)**
   - Rare in children; histological exam ruling out malignancy.

10. **Respiratory Papilloma**
    - Strong potential due to isolated mass causing obstructive symptoms.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Respiratory Papilloma** - Most likely given the detailed description of the mass characteristics and common presentation in children.
2. **Vocal Cord Dysfunction** - Considered based on initial stridor symptoms but ultimately dismissed after visualization of the tracheal mass.
3. **Laryngeal Papillomatosis** - Potential due to papilloma type, but typical presentation involves multiple lesions.
4. **Hemangioma** - Possibility given its vascular nature, though less likely given location and single mass description.
5. **Tracheal Tumors (Carcinoma)** - Very rare but serious; less likely given typical age and presentation.
6. **Laryngomalacia** - Initially possible given stridor but ruled out via direct visualization.
7. **Subglottic Stenosis** - Ruled out given visualization of a distinct mass.
8. **Tracheomalacia** - Ruled out as imaging and scopes visualized a mass.
9. **Seasonal Allergies** - Ruled out after lack of symptomatic relief with medical treatment.
10. **Asthma** - Ruled out due to lack of improvement with asthma medications and upper airway findings.

### Summary:
The most likely diagnosis is a respiratory papilloma, based on the clinical presentation and direct visualization of the characteristics of the mass. Further histopathological examination of the excised mass would be needed to confirm this diagnosis.","['Otolaryngology', 'Pediatrics', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Pulmonary Medicine']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,F

### INPUT:
A woman in her mid-40s presented to the emergency department after a fall with head trauma. A head computed tomography showed a 0.9-cm left subdural hematoma with a mild left to right midline shift. Her ethanol level was 202 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.2171); magnesium, 1.7 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.4114); potassium, 4.4 mEq/L (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1); and ionized calcium, 4.6 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.25). The patient developed cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias in the emergency department and was successfully resuscitated. Echocardiography demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and no regional wall motion abnormalities. She subsequently underwent embolization of the middle meningeal artery. After embolization, however, a worsening rightward midline shift was discovered. As a result, on the 11th day of her hospitalization, she had a burr hole evacuation. During day 15 of admission, the patient had 3 episodes of torsade de pointes (TdP) while receiving 50 mg of metoprolol succinate daily, and her 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure 1. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",T-wave alternans,"Step 1: **Chronic Alcohol Abuse**
- The elevated ethanol level suggests that the patient may have a history of chronic alcohol use, which can have multiple system effects.

Step 2: **Subdural Hematoma**
- The presence of a subdural hematoma on CT scan indicates a traumatic intracranial hemorrhage.

Step 3: **Electrolyte Imbalance**
- Given her history and current lab results, it is possible she may have underlying chronic electrolyte imbalances, particularly related to magnesium and potassium levels.

Step 4: **Alcohol-Induced Cardiomyopathy**
- The development of ventricular arrhythmias and an ejection fraction of 50% suggests a possibility of alcohol contributing to cardiac dysfunction.

Step 5: **Post-Traumatic Epilepsy**
- Post-traumatic epilepsy can occur after head injury and could explain some of the cardiac rhythm disturbances through neurocardiogenic mechanisms.

Step 6: **Medication-Induced QT Prolongation**
- With the administration of metoprolol and her recent history of TdP, there might be medication-induced QT prolongation.

Step 7: **Wernicke’s Encephalopathy**
- Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to thiamine deficiency and Wernicke’s encephalopathy, which might exacerbate neurological symptoms.

Step 8: **Subclinical Hypothyroidism**
- Thyroid dysfunction can sometimes manifest as cardiac arrhythmias and should be considered in the differential.

Step 9: **Long QT Syndrome**
- A genetic predisposition to long QT syndrome can also be a factor, particularly if the ECG suggests characteristic findings.

Step 10: **Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome**
- Her high ethanol levels and history suggest she may be going through alcohol withdrawal, which can also present with arrhythmias.

### INPUT:
A female patient in her late 40s presented with a 3-year history of nonhealing ulcers in her groin and axillae. These lesions started as itchy, weepy, reddish papules and plaques, which gradually progressed to form ulcers and were associated with pain and pus discharge. They did not heal completely after multiple courses of topical as well as systemic antibiotics, antifungals, and steroids. She frequently experienced scaling and greasiness on her scalp, which was treated with shampoos and topical steroids. She also complained of polyuria and polydipsia for the past 4 years. General examination revealed multiple mobile, firm, nonmatted, and nontender lymph nodes in cervical and inguinal region. On systemic examination, hepatomegaly (2 cm below the right costal margin) was seen. There was also bilateral enlargement of the parotid area, which was tender on palpation. Cutaneous examination revealed yellowish greasy scales on the scalp, suggestive of seborrheic dermatitis. Erythematous edematous papules were present over the retroauricular areas and the inframammary folds (Figure, A). On examination of external genitalia, deep ulcers were observed in the bilateral inguinal folds, resembling knife-cut ulcers (Figure, B). Similar lesions were present over the junction of labia majora and labia minora and were associated with yellowish pus discharge. A 3.5-mm punch biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathological examination from the edge of an ulcer on one of the groin folds (Figure, C and D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Langerhans cell histiocytosis,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma** - Given the persistent, non-healing nature of the ulcers, lymphadenopathy, and hepatomegaly.
  
2. **Langerhans cell histiocytosis** - Chronic, non-healing ulcerative skin lesions and systemic involvement (hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy).
  
3. **Sarcoidosis** - Skin ulcers, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and parotid gland enlargement.
  
4. **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)** - Skin lesions, systemic symptoms including hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy.
  
5. **Crohn’s disease** - Ulcerative lesions in the inguinal region could be indicative of cutaneous Crohn’s, along with systemic symptoms.
  
6. **Pemphigus vulgaris** - Chronic, painful, non-healing ulcerations, can affect mucous membranes as well.
  
7. **Diabetes mellitus** - Non-healing ulcers, polyuria, and polydipsia point towards diabetes-related complications such as peripheral vascular disease or neuropathy.
  
8. **Tuberculosis (cutaneous)** - Primary involvement with non-healing ulcers, especially if systemic TB symptoms are present.
  
9. **Behçet's disease** - Recurrent ulcers, though more typical in the oral and genital areas, and potential systemic involvement.
  
10. **HIV-associated ulcers** - Persistent ulcerative lesions, possible systemic lymphadenopathy and infections, parotid enlargement.

### Re-ranked Differential Diagnosis based on comprehensive review:

1. **Langerhans cell histiocytosis** - Considering the chronicity, non-healing ulcers, systemic involvement, and characteristic biopsy findings.
2. **Sarcoidosis** - Pulmonary, hepatic, and cutaneous involvement are significant clues.
3. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma** - Persistent, unexplained skin involvement plus systemic symptoms.
4. **HIV-associated ulcers** - Fits within the systemic signs and prolonged course, necessitate ruling out.
5. **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)** - Chronic skin issues with systemic symptoms, though typically has more widespread systemic manifestations.
6. **Behçet's disease** - Chronic recurrent ulcers, though more typically oral/genital.
7. **Crohn’s disease** - Cutaneous complications related to systemic disease.
8. **Diabetes mellitus** - Given the ulcers and polyuria/polydipsia, needs exclusion to rule out secondary infection or other complications.
9. **Pemphigus vulgaris** - Painful mucocutaneous ulcers.
10. **Tuberculosis (cutaneous)** - Chronic ulcers, systemic involvement with hepatomegaly, though definitive TB signs would steer diagnosis.

These steps and rankings consider the chronicity and nature of the symptoms, the systemic signs, patient’s age, and the need to rule in/out potentially serious systemic diseases.","['Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Gynecology', ""Women's Health""]",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,45.0,F

### INPUT:
A 48-year-old woman presented with 3 days of worsening right orbital swelling, eye pain, blurry vision, and 3 months of bilateral photophobia. She also reported bilateral rhinorrhea, congestion, and right frontal and temporal headaches. Active medical issues included hypertension, very poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use, and asthma. Her brother and father both had a history of chronic orbital swelling. Vital signs were unremarkable, and examination of the right eye showed moderate chemosis, injected conjunctiva, and periorbital edema. Both eyes were proptotic, right worse than left. She had normal bilateral extraocular movements, pupillary light reflexes, and gross vision. Computed tomography with contrast revealed bilateral ethmoid and frontal sinus opacification and right worse than left orbital fat stranding (Figure 1A). Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast demonstrated both enlargement and enhancement of bilateral extraocular muscles, especially the right superior rectus (Figure 1B). Initially she was started on antibiotic therapy. Right nasal biopsy, right endoscopic sinus surgery, and right anterior superior orbital tissue biopsy were performed. Intraoperatively, the sinus mucosa demonstrated only edema and mild secretions, but there was no necrosis or purulence. Both orbital and nasal cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Orbital biopsy showed nodular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates without evidence of fungal infection or necrosis (Figure 1C). Further workup revealed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, total IgG, and IgG4 levels and normal white blood cell count, thyroid-stimulating hormone, angiotensin-converting enzyme, lysozyme, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",IgG4-related disease,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis (Step by Step):

1. **Orbital Cellulitis**
2. **Thyroid Eye Disease (Graves' Orbitopathy)**
3. **IgG4-Related Disease**
4. **Chronic Sinusitis with Orbital Complications**
5. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation (Orbital Pseudotumor)**
6. **Rheumatoid Arthritis with Secondary Orbital Involvement**
7. **Sarcoidosis with Orbital Involvement**
8. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome**
9. **Lymphoproliferative Disorder (such as lymphoid hyperplasia or lymphoma)**
10. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener’s Granulomatosis)**

### Re-ranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **IgG4-Related Disease**  
   - Elevated IgG4 levels, bilateral presentation with proptosis, and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate suggest IgG4-Related Disease.

2. **Chronic Sinusitis with Orbital Complications**
   - Chronic sinus issues noted on imaging and operative findings of sinus mucosa edema.

3. **Orbital Cellulitis**
   - Infectious process confirmed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cultures.

4. **Thyroid Eye Disease (Graves' Orbitopathy)**
   - Bilateral enlargement and enhancement of extraocular muscles, but normal thyroid function makes this less likely without further evidence.

5. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation (Orbital Pseudotumor)**
   - Fits the clinical presentation and imaging findings but lacks the specific hallmark findings (e.g., IgG4, systemic inflammation markers).

6. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener’s Granulomatosis)**
   - Considered due to orbital involvement and sinus disease, but negative ANCA and lack of necrosis/vascular involvement in biopsy.

7. **Lymphoproliferative Disorder (such as lymphoid hyperplasia or lymphoma)**
   - Lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate noted on biopsy, but lack of more specific markers suggest other causes first.

8. **Sarcoidosis with Orbital Involvement**
   - Imaging and histology findings align, but normal ACE and lysozyme levels make this less likely.

9. **Rheumatoid Arthritis with Secondary Orbital Involvement**
   - Less likely without joint disease history or rheumatoid factor positivity.

10. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome**
    - Unilateral pain and proptosis can fit, but lack of classic cavernous sinus involvement and other supporting findings make it less likely.

### INPUT:
A man in his 50s presented with bleeding wounds and nodules on the bilateral hips and forearms. He previously received failed systemic and radiation therapy for tumor stage mycosis fungoides (MF). He had received 11 courses of extended beam radiation therapy, including 3 courses of total skin irradiation of 24 to 30 Gy, and focal irradiation to the left posterior thigh and hip/buttock with 2.5/3 Gy to 12.5/24 Gy, respectively, and the right posterior thigh and hip with 2 Gy to 20 and 26 Gy, respectively. Seven years before this visit, he underwent a reduced-intensity, matched, unrelated donor, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). His post-transplant course was complicated by severe chronic graft vs host disease of the skin, eyes, and gut, for which he received systemic corticosteroid therapy, tacrolimus, methotrexate, and long-term extracorporeal photopheresis. Three years after the HSCT, he developed chronic ulcerations on the hips, back, and arms at the site of previously irradiated tumors, as well as multiple friable, hemorrhagic, and bleeding nodules on bilateral hips and his forearms while receiving treatment with corticosteroids and extracorporeal photopheresis. He underwent several debulking procedures and excision biopsies of the nodules, which revealed granulation tissue on histology. In this latest visit, physical examination revealed recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on his left lateral hip and left lateral buttock (Figure 1). Similar nodules were noted on his right hip and forearm. The patient underwent repeated debulking and biopsy. He was also treated with micafungin, amphotericin B, levofloxacin, dapsone, acyclovir, pentamidine, penicillin VK, and posaconazole. Positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT) results did not show evidence of visceral or extracutaneous disease. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Angiosarcoma,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Chronic ulcers with possible chronic infection** — given the prior extensive radiation therapy and immunosuppressive treatment.
2. **Radiation dermatitis** — due to multiple courses of high-dose radiation therapy.
3. **Chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD)** — considering the patient's history of severe chronic GVHD of the skin.
4. **Secondary malignancy (e.g., post-radiation sarcoma)** — related to prior extensive radiation exposure.
5. **Cutaneous fungal infection** — as he was treated with antifungal medications, suggesting a concern for fungal infection.
6. **Chronic bacterial infection** — he was treated with various antibiotics, indicating a suspicion of bacterial involvement.
7. **Drug-induced skin reactions** — due to the multiple medications he is on, particularly those implicated in skin reactions.
8. **Persistent or recurrent mycosis fungoides** — given his initial diagnosis and treatment history for this condition.
9. **Granulomatous disease** — suggested by histology revealing granulation tissue.
10. **Pyoderma gangrenosum** — which might be considered due to the appearance of the nodules and ulcerations.

### Reranked Based on Comprehensive Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Persistent or recurrent mycosis fungoides** — The patient's background with MF and the clinical presentation strongly suggest recurrence or persistence of the primary disease.
2. **Chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD)** — Given his history of severe chronic GVHD and the extensive skin involvement.
3. **Cutaneous fungal infection** — The ongoing antifungal treatment indicates this is a highly considered diagnosis.
4. **Chronic bacterial infection** — Supported by the broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage the patient has received.
5. **Radiation dermatitis** — Fits with the history of recurrent ulcerations in previously irradiated areas.
6. **Granulomatous disease** — Biopsy findings of granulation tissue suggest a granulomatous condition.
7. **Chronic ulcers with possible chronic infection** — Based on the longstanding nature of his skin wounds.
8. **Secondary malignancy (e.g., post-radiation sarcoma)** — Less likely, but still a consideration given prior radiation exposure.
9. **Drug-induced skin reactions** — The multiplicity and systemic nature of the medications he is on could contribute, although less likely primary cause here.
10. **Pyoderma gangrenosum** — Considered due to the ulcerative and nodular nature of the lesions, but lower on the list given other factors.

In conclusion, the leading differential diagnoses are persistent or recurrent mycosis fungoides, chronic GVHD, and cutaneous infections (both fungal and bacterial), with other conditions being less likely but still plausible.","['Lymphomas', 'Skin Lymphomas', 'Dermatology', 'Hematology', 'Oncology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,50.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his mid-50s with a medical history of nonspecific T-wave abnormalities on electrocardiogram (ECG) reported new-onset chest discomfort, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath that woke him from sleep. Emergency medical services found him to be in a wide complex tachycardia. He was administered a 150-mg bolus of intravenous amiodarone, which failed to terminate his arrhythmia. He ultimately required synchronized cardioversion with a biphasic direct current shock of 100 J. On arrival to the emergency department, his vital signs were stable. Serum electrolyte levels were within normal range and C-reactive protein was less than 6 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10). High-sensitivity troponin peaked at 1078 pg/mL. His initial 12-lead ECG is shown in Figure 1A. He continued in sinus rhythm with episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia observed on telemetry, as shown in Figure 1B. Cardiac catheterization revealed patent coronary arteries. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was remarkable for a dilated right ventricle with moderately reduced systolic function and transmural late gadolinium enhancement with akinesis and dyskinesis involving the right ventricular (RV) free wall and outflow tract extending to the left ventricular (LV) anterior, septal, and apical segments. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cardiac sarcoidosis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Ischemic Heart Disease**
   - Despite the patient having patent coronary arteries, a high troponin level warrants consideration for myocardial ischemia or infarction.
   
2. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy/Dysplasia (ARVC/D)**
   - Dilated RV with reduced systolic function and late gadolinium enhancement in RV and parts of LV on MRI suggests an ARVC/D.

3. **Viral Myocarditis**
    - Myocarditis can cause a dilated cardiomyopathy and is compatible with ECG changes and ventricular arrhythmias.

4. **Dilated Cardiomyopathy**
    - A dilated RV and nonsustained VT could signify a form of generalized dilated cardiomyopathy.

5. **Sarcoidosis**
    - Cardiac sarcoidosis can lead to arrhythmias and systolic dysfunction and may involve both ventricles.

6. **Giant Cell Myocarditis**
    - This presents with rapidly progressive heart failure and ventricular arrhythmias, though it is rare.

7. **Chagas Disease**
    - A parasitic infection that can cause chronic myocarditis leading to dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias.

8. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy**
    - While hypertrophy is more typical, some forms may present with nonspecific ECG changes and ventricular arrhythmias.

9. **Amyloidosis**
    - This infiltrative disease can involve the heart and cause arrhythmias along with structural changes.

10. **Left Ventricular Noncompaction**
    - This cardiomyopathy can present with systolic dysfunction and arrhythmias but is less specific to RV involvement.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy/Dysplasia (ARVC/D)**
   - Most consistent with MRI findings of RV dilation, systolic dysfunction, and ventricular arrhythmias.
   
2. **Dilated Cardiomyopathy**
   - Fits the generalized pattern of ventricular dilation and arrhythmia.

3. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Can cause both ventricular arrhythmias and dilation, with potential for systemic manifestations.

4. **Viral Myocarditis**
   - Compatible with dilated RV and ventricular dysfunction; however, additional systemic symptoms usually help confirm this diagnosis.

5. **Giant Cell Myocarditis**
   - Rare but fitting the presentation of acute on chronic heart failure with arrhythmia.

6. **Ischemic Heart Disease**
   - Elevated troponin could suggest myocardial injury, but coronary arteries are patent, making this less likely.

7. **Chagas Disease**
   - Uncommon in non-endemic areas but could match the diagnosis if there is relevant travel history.
    
8. **Amyloidosis**
    - Could show similar cardiac involvement but usually presents with more specific systemic signs.
    
9. **Left Ventricular Noncompaction**
    - Less likely due to less frequent RV predominance and typical apical trabeculations on imaging not described here.
    
10. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy**
    - Unlikely given the lack of significant hypertrophy and ECG findings more associated with ischemia.","['Rhythm Disorders', 'Cardiology']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,55.0,M

### INPUT:
A 71-year-old man presented to the dermatologist with a 6-week history of a rapidly progressing rash and swelling of the left side of the chest wall. He had noticed the rash a few days after receiving the second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna). He denied itching, weeping, bleeding, or discharge from the rash or the nipple. He had a history of metabolic syndrome treated with antihypertensives and oral hypoglycemics. The physical examination showed a morbidly obese White man. The skin examination showed a 19 × 10-cm pink, fallacious purple color deep-infiltrated papule in the left breast and a similar 15 × 7-cm papule under the left clavicle (Figure, A). The breast examination was notable for bilateral gynecomastia and inverted left nipple without any palpable lumps. No lymphadenopathy was noted either. His laboratory results showed stage 2 chronic kidney disease. Results of a viral panel including hepatitis A, B, and C and HIV were negative. The punch biopsy of the skin showed a diffuse island of atypical cells in the dermis (Figure, B). On immunohistochemical staining, the atypical cells stained positive for CK-7, GATA-3, and PAX-8 (weak focal staining) and negative for estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (<1%), TTF-1, SATB-2, CDX-2, and NKX-3.1. The positron emission tomography–computed tomography scan showed a diffuse, infiltrating fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid cutaneous lesion on the left chest wall (standardized uptake value, 6.5) and multiple FDG-avid nodes in the axilla (bilaterally), left internal mammary, and left cervical chain. The core biopsy from the lymph node is shown in the Figure, C. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Inflammatory breast cancer,"Given the detailed patient history, examination, and test results, we can create a differential diagnosis list step by step. Each step will introduce a new differential diagnosis.

### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Breast Cancer**: Given the rapid progression of the rash, swelling, and the presence of gynecomastia.
2. **Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**: Rapidly progressing and infiltrating skin lesions.
3. **Cutaneous Metastasis**: Secondary to an undiagnosed internal malignancy since atypical cells are found.
4. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**: Less likely due to deep infiltration but still a consideration.
5. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans (DFSP)**: A slow-growing tumor that might be less likely due to rapid progression.
6. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma**: A neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin that can spread to lymph nodes rapidly.
7. **Primary Cutaneous Lymphoma**: Relatively rare but characterized by atypical cells.
8. **Paget’s Disease of the Breast**: Given nipple involvement but less likely due to rash characteristics.
9. **Angiosarcoma**: A highly aggressive tumor often presenting as a rapidly growing purple lesion.
10. **Infection-related rash**: Though less likely due to negative viral panel and biopsy findings, considering immunosuppression-related possibilities.

### Reranked Final Differential Diagnoses based on Full Information:

1. **Cutaneous Metastasis**: Most likely given atypical cells in dermis, positive immunohistochemical staining pattern (CK-7, GATA-3, PAX-8), and PET scan results.
2. **Metastatic Breast Cancer**: Especially with gynecomastia and nipple involvement, though negative ER/PR staining reduces likelihood.
3. **Angiosarcoma**: Rapidly progressing, infiltrative lesion with purplish hue.
4. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma**: Given the rapid progression and lymph node involvement.
5. **Primary Cutaneous Lymphoma**: Notable for atypical lymphoid cells in skin, though less common.
6. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans (DFSP)**: Typically slow-growing but still considered.
7. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**: Unlikely due to depth of infiltration.
8. **Paget’s Disease of the Breast**: Given nipple involvement but less likely due to ER/PR negativity.
9. **Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**: Improbable given the depth and pattern of lesions.
10. **Infection-related rash**: Extremely unlikely based on negative viral panels and biopsy findings.

The most likely diagnosis given the information is **Cutaneous Metastasis**, secondary to a possibly unidentified primary malignancy, notably indicated by the immunohistochemical profile and PET scan findings.","['Breast Cancer', 'Dermatology', 'Oncology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,71.0,M

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Ovarian Neoplasm**: Given the large abdominal mass in a postmenopausal woman, ovarian neoplasm remains a key consideration even though serum CA-125 is normal.
2. **Retroperitoneal Liposarcoma**: Large retroperitoneal masses can present with similar symptoms and this diagnosis can explain the extent and size of the mass.
3. **Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)**: The large mass without gastrointestinal symptoms or abnormalities on endoscopy is consistent with GIST.
4. **Abdominal Sarcoma**: A large mass of non-specific origin might be a sarcoma.
5. **Lymphoma**: Abdominal lymphomas can present with large masses; however, normal blood work makes this a less likely diagnosis.
6. **Desmoid Tumor**: As a fibrous tissue tumor, a desmoid tumor can cause large abdominal masses but is less common.
7. **Mesenteric Cyst**: This is consistent with a large, encapsulated mass, but other features might make it less likely.
8. **Pancreatic Pseudocyst**: Less likely due to lack of pancreatitis history and specific laboratory findings.
9. **Large Cystic Teratoma**: Could explain the mass but less likely given the normal tumor markers.

A 68-year-old man with a history of keratoconus was referred for evaluation of a choroidal lesion in his left eye. He reported intermittent dull pain in his left eye for 1 month that improved with acetaminophen. His family history was significant for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (mother) and leukemia (mother and maternal grandfather). On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/200 OS, limited by keratoconus. Extraocular movements were full, there was no relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressures were 13 mm Hg OD and 11 mm Hg OS. There was no proptosis. Anterior segment examination demonstrated keratoconus with corneal scarring in both eyes and Descemet folds in the left eye. Both eyes had mixed cataract. There were no signs of anterior segment or vitreous inflammation. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed an amelanotic area of choroidal thickening (confirmed by optical coherence tomography) overhanging the inferonasal margin of the optic disc with associated subretinal fluid and scattered areas of hyperpigmentation (Figure 1A). There was an additional, subtle amelanotic elevated lesion under the fovea. Fundus autofluorescence demonstrated hyperautofluorescence in a leopard-spotting pattern (Figure 1B). Indocyanine green angiography revealed hypocyanescent lesions inferonasal to the disc and at the fovea.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:

Based on the patient’s clinical presentation, history, and test results, the differential diagnoses will be re-evaluated and prioritized: 

1. **Choroidal Melanoma**: Given the choroidal thickening, subretinal fluid, and areas of hyperpigmentation, choroidal melanoma is a primary concern.
2. **Choroidal Metastasis**: Family history of lymphomas and leukemia raises the suspicion for metastatic malignancies, particularly given the amelanotic nature of the lesion.
3. **Lymphoma**: Although less common, ocular manifestations of systemic lymphomas must be considered, especially with the significant family history.
4. **Choroidal Hemangioma**: While rare, choroidal hemangiomas can present with similar features but are typically more vascular on imaging.
5. **Choroidal Nevus**: The presence of hyperpigmentation could indicate a benign nevus, although less likely given the symptoms and progressive nature.
6. **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**: Overlying drusen in advanced cases can mimic some of these findings, though the age and lesion characteristics are less typical.
7. **Posterior Scleritis**: Inflammation of the globe wall could mimic some of the observed findings but typically presents with more inflammation and pain.
8. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Disease**: This autoimmune condition includes ocular symptoms but is less common and typically bilateral.
9. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome**: This condition can lead to detachment of the choroid, but the presentation is often different in pattern and demographic.

A 19-year-old male presented for evaluation of painful lesions on the tongue that had been present for at least 3 months. He stated that the pain was exacerbated by spicy foods. He had initially presented to a primary care practitioner, was prescribed clotrimazole lozenges, and reported mild initial improvement followed by symptom progression. Subsequently, the practitioner referred the patient to an otolaryngologist. The patient denied any enlarged lymph nodes, fevers, fatigue, rash, weight loss, or abnormal gastrointestinal symptoms and had no noteworthy medical history. He reported mild alcohol consumption, denied any cigarette or illicit substance use, and endorsed engaging in oral and anal intercourse. A physical examination was notable for bilateral raised leukoplakia on the tongue; it was larger on the right side than the left and had a slightly hairy appearance. The lesion was tender to touch and could not be scraped off (Figure 1A). The lips and oral mucosa were without lesions, masses, or ulcers. The patient had no cervical lymphadenopathy. The findings of the physical examination were otherwise unremarkable. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Secondary syphilis,"### Step 1: Oral Hairy Leukoplakia
Given the description of bilateral raised leukoplakia with a slightly hairy appearance on the tongue that cannot be scraped off, and noting the patient's risk factors (engagement in oral intercourse), Oral Hairy Leukoplakia, commonly associated with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection, should be considered.

### Step 2: Chronic Hyperplastic Candidiasis
Considering the long-duration white lesions that cannot be scraped off and were initially treated with antifungal lozenges without significant improvement, Chronic Hyperplastic Candidiasis may be a possibility that needs ruling out.

### Step 3: Syphilitic Glossitis
The patient’s engagement in oral and anal intercourse puts him at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including syphilis, which can present as glossitis and oral lesions in secondary stages.

### Step 4: Oral Lichen Planus
Oral Lichen Planus often presents with white, lacy lesions on the mucosa, which could be confused with leukoplakia. It is another condition to consider given the chronicity and pain associated with lesions in the oral cavity.

### Step 5: Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Although less common in a young patient without major risk factors like smoking, persistent leukoplakic lesions, especially those not responding to initial treatments, warrant consideration of malignancy such as Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

### Step 6: Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-Associated Lesions
HPV can cause oral lesions, particularly in individuals with a history of oral sex. These lesions may mimic leukoplakia and present with similar features.

### Step 7: Discoid Lupus Erythematosus
Oral manifestations of Discoid Lupus Erythematosus include chronic, painful ulcers with a white striated border that could resemble leukoplakia.

### Step 8: Geographic Tongue
Although typically not as persistent and usually has a characteristic migratory pattern, Geographic Tongue can cause painful lesions and hence is worth considering.

### Step 9: Erythroplakia
Erythroplakia is less common but more concerning due to its potential for malignancy. It often presents as a red lesion but can intermingle with white patches resembling leukoplakia.

### Step 10: Oral Tuberculosis
Although rare, oral Tuberculosis can present with chronic non-healing ulcers or lesions in the oral cavity. Considering infectious causes broadly, it remains a distant differential diagnosis.

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnosis
1. Oral Hairy Leukoplakia
2. Chronic Hyperplastic Candidiasis
3. Syphilitic Glossitis
4. Oral Lichen Planus
5. Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-Associated Lesions
6. Squamous Cell Carcinoma
7. Discoid Lupus Erythematosus
8. Erythroplakia
9. Geographic Tongue
10. Oral Tuberculosis

The patient's history, sexual practices, clinical examination findings, and the chronicity of the lesions necessitate placing Oral Hairy Leukoplakia at the top, followed by other differentials based on symptom congruence and the likelihood of occurrence.","['Otolaryngology', 'Dental Medicine']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,19.0,M

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 12-year-old boy presented with a 3-month history of nasal obstruction, progressive dysphonia, recurrent deep neck abscesses, and tender, bulky cervical lymphadenopathy. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck with contrast at his initial hospital admission was concerning for suppurative lymphadenitis. Despite incision and drainage, and intravenous ampicillin and sulbactam, his cervical lymphadenopathy persisted. Results of subsequent workup—including Haemophilus, tetanus, and pneumococcal antibody titers; QuantiFERON-TB Gold test; serum IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE levels; absolute lymphocyte count; neutrophil phenotype and function; angiotensin-converting enzyme level; HLA-B27 test; and antinuclear antibody level—were within normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging of the neck with gadolinium contrast demonstrated bilateral, bulky, enlarged cervical lymph nodes, as well as enhancing nodules in the left laryngeal ventricle (2.3 × 1.6 × 1.2 cm), right false vocal cord, and right tracheal wall (0.6 × 0.4 cm). Findings from nasal endoscopy, awake flexible laryngoscopy, and operative microlaryngoscopy revealed yellow submucosal masses in the left nasal cavity, left laryngeal ventricle, and right trachea, as well as left vocal cord paresis (Figure, A). Biopsies were taken of the tracheal, laryngeal, and nasal cavity masses, and an excisional biopsy was taken of a left cervical lymph node (Figure, B). Histopathologic examination revealed a prominent infiltrate of benign-appearing histiocytes with numerous forms showing emperipolesis and some nuclei showing distinct central nucleoli. Immunohistochemical staining in these cells was positive for S100 and negative for CD1a. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Rosai-Dorfman disease,"Let's proceed step by step to generate a differential diagnosis list and then rerank it according to all patient information and test results.

**Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:**
1. **Rosai-Dorfman Disease** - Given the histopathologic infiltration by benign-appearing histiocytes showing emperipolesis, and positive S100 staining.
2. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - Multisystem involvement and potential histiocyte-related pathologies.
3. **Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease** - Consider for tender cervical lymphadenopathy and histiocyte presence.
4. **Castleman Disease** - Given lymphadenopathy despite normal infectious serologies.
5. **Sarcoidosis** - Despite normal ACE levels, granulomas could still be a possibility.
6. **Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD)** - Recurrent neck abscesses and potential lymphadenopathy in an immune context.
7. **Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma** - Persistent lymphadenopathy with bulky nodes.
8. **Tuberculosis (TB)** - Despite negative QuantiFERON-TB, granulomatous infection consideration.
9. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - Negative ANA but still considering autoimmune phenomena with the persistent immune response.
10. **Metastatic Carcinoma** - Unusual but given the persistent masses and lymphadenopathy.

**Reranked Differential Diagnosis:**
1. **Rosai-Dorfman Disease (RDD)** - Strong evidence from histopathological findings such as emperipolesis, positive S100, and negative CD1a, corresponding to RDD.
2. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH)** - Systemic manifestations and histiocyte pathology, though less likely due to CD1a negativity.
3. **Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease** - Fits with cervical lymphadenopathy although less common in males and not typically such extensive organ involvement.
4. **Castleman Disease** - Consideration due to persistent lymphadenopathy but lacking specific histological supporting findings seen in RDD.
5. **Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD)** - Persistent infections and abscesses fits, but histopathology less supportive.
6. **Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma** - Persistent lymphadenopathy fits, but histopathology indicates benign nature of cells.
7. **Sarcoidosis** - Granulomatous disease fitting the picture but ruled out by normal ACE.
8. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - With negative ANA and no other autoimmune markers, less likely.
9. **Tuberculosis (TB)** - Negative tests and lack of classic granulomas push TB down the list.
10. **Metastatic Carcinoma** - Least likely from histopathology identifying benign histiocyte involvement.

Thus, the most likely diagnosis given the patient's clinical presentation and histopathological findings is **Rosai-Dorfman Disease (RDD)**.","['Hematology', 'Pediatrics', 'Laryngology', 'Otolaryngology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,12.0,M

### INPUT:
A 55-year-old female patient with a history of hypercholesterolemia and anxiety was referred for progressive imbalance while walking and intense fear of falling for the past 14 years. The patient had become progressively disabled and had been using a wheelchair for 4 years prior to presentation. Neurological examination showed gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus in both directions along with slow saccades and gaze restriction in both vertical and horizontal planes. There was ataxic dysarthria. Tone was normal in all 4 limbs but stretch reflexes were absent and plantar fascia were mute. Limb power was normal. Ataxia was seen on finger-to-nose and heel-knee-shin tests. Chorea was present in both legs. Ankle inversion with bilateral hammertoes was noted. Electromyography revealed sensory neuronopathy. On brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffuse cerebellar atrophy was noted along with T2 hyperintensities in bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar white matter, pons, and bilateral thalamus (Figure). Psychiatric treatment was commenced for her severe anxiety but did not relieve the fear of falling.

### INPUT:
A woman in her late 70s with a history of immunoglobulin A monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance presented with a tender, draining lesion of the central face despite several courses of treatment with antibiotics (Figure, A). The patient lived in Southern California but had visited Kenya for an extended trip a few years prior. Review of systems was negative for fevers, night sweats, weight loss, headache, vision changes, respiratory distress, or arthralgias. On the left nasal dorsum and medial cheek, there was a 3 × 4 cm violaceous plaque with focal purulent drainage. Within several weeks, the lesion rapidly expanded into a vegetative, freely draining plaque covering the cheeks and glabella and approaching the medial canthi (Figure, B). Computed tomography revealed findings consistent with abscess that did not involve the orbits, sinuses, or bone. Chest radiography results were unremarkable. Punch biopsy specimens were obtained for histopathological analysis and tissue cultures (Figure, C). Tissue culture results at 2 weeks remained negative, and a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test result was negative. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pyoderma gangrenosum,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Cutaneous Leishmaniasis**: Considering her travel history to Kenya and the presentation of a tender, draining lesion.
2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Given her age and the violaceous, rapidly expanding lesion.
3. **Mycobacterium marinum infection**: Atypical mycobacterial infections due to prior antibiotic resistance.
4. **Cutaneous Nocardiosis**: Immunosuppressed state and abscess formation with negative initial cultures.
5. **Actinomycosis**: Chronic, draining lesion can present similarly.
6. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**: Rapidly expanding ulcerative lesion with draining plaque.
7. **Rhinocerebral Mucormycosis**: Given lesions expanding near the nasal dorsum and cheeks.
8. **Basal Cell Carcinoma**: Common in elderly with a long-standing lesion that may ulcerate and drain.
9. **Chronic Ulcerative Herpes Simplex Virus**: Immunosuppression could render HSV chronic and severe.
10. **Deep Fungal Infection (e.g., Blastomycosis)**: Possible fungal infection with negative initial cultures.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis with Full Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Cutaneous Leishmaniasis**: Travel history to Kenya, expanding lesion despite antibiotics, and unremarkable chest radiography, with no systemic symptoms.
2. **Cutaneous Nocardiosis**: Immunosuppressed state, abscess formation, negative initial cultures.
3. **Actinomycosis**: Chronic, draining lesion possibility despite negative cultures up to 2 weeks.
4. **Mycobacterium marinum infection**: Fits the presentation and resistance to antibiotics with susceptible culture delay.
5. **Deep Fungal Infection (e.g., Blastomycosis)**: Immune compromise and geographical exposure.
6. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**: Rapidly expanding ulcerative lesion in an elderly patient can suggest autoimmune etiology.
7. **Basal Cell Carcinoma**: Lesion characteristics but lacking the typical system involvement despite rapid progression.
8. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Consider due to age and lesion characteristics; needs histopathology confirmation.
9. **Rhinocerebral Mucormycosis**: Does not fit the course of disease and negative orbit involvement.
10. **Chronic Ulcerative Herpes Simplex Virus**: Unlikely without further systemic symptoms.

### INPUT:
An 81-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of a slow-growing mass in her left cheek. She denied having any symptoms, tenderness, numbness, or facial nerve weakness. Physical examination revealed a mass in the buccinator space that was smooth, was nontender to palpation, and had no overlying cutaneous changes. A contrast-enhanced maxillofacial computed tomography scan demonstrated a 1.8 × 1.8 × 1.9-cm rounded, well-circumscribed lesion at the anterior aspect of the left masticator space (Figure 1). The mass was abutting the parotid duct, which did not appear dilated, and appeared to have a peripheral rim of hyperenhancing soft tissue with a central cystic/necrotic component. Results of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration revealed rare epithelial cells with degenerative changes and inflammatory cells present. Findings from a core biopsy demonstrated a spindle cell neoplasm of uncertain origin. On immunostaining, spindle cells were CK8/18, S100, and SOX10 negative; myosin and smooth muscle actin (SMA) negative; and CD31 negative. However, STAT6 staining was diffusely positive. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Solitary fibrous tumor,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Solitary Fibrous Tumor (SFT)**
   - A well-circumscribed mass with positive STAT6 staining is highly suggestive of SFT.

2. **Pleomorphic Adenoma**
   - A common benign tumor of the salivary gland, typically well-circumscribed but not characteristically STAT6 positive.

3. **Schwannoma**
   - Typically S100 positive, which contradicts the patient's results.

4. **Neurofibroma**
   - S100 positive and typically presents differently histologically.

5. **Lipoma**
   - Typically lacks spindle cells and STAT6 positivity.

6. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma**
   - CK8/18 positive but usually presents with epithelial cells, not consistent with the spindle cell neoplasm findings.

7. **Rhabdomyosarcoma**
   - Myosin and SMA would likely be positive, contradictory to the patient's immunostaining results.

8. **Hemangiopericytoma**
   - Now considered a part of the solitary fibrous tumor spectrum and could present with similar features.

9. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans (DFSP)**
   - Typically CD34 positive, which is not noted in the immunostaining profile.

10. **Epithelioid Sarcoma**
   - Would generally show EMA and cytokeratin positivity, which isn't supportive of the current findings.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Solitary Fibrous Tumor (SFT)**
   - Strong likelihood given the STAT6 positivity and clinical presentation.

2. **Hemangiopericytoma**
   - Closely related to SFT and shares similar histopathologic features.

3. **Pleomorphic Adenoma**
   - Although common in this area, the immunostaining does not support this diagnosis as strongly.

4. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma**
   - Less likely due to immunostaining results, but still a consideration for salivary gland tumors.

5. **Schwannoma**
   - Less likely due to the lack of S100 positivity.

6. **Neurofibroma**
   - Unlikely given histological and immunostaining inconsistency.

7. **Lipoma**
   - Does not fit well with the histological description given.

8. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans (DFSP)**
   - Unlikely due to immunostaining profile.

9. **Rhabdomyosarcoma**
   - Unlikely given the lack of myosin and SMA positivity.

10. **Epithelioid Sarcoma**
   - Unlikely based on the provided immunostaining as well.

By considering the patient's age, the clinical characteristics of the mass, and the detailed immunostaining results, **Solitary Fibrous Tumor** remains the most fitting diagnosis.","['Otolaryngology', 'Salivary Gland Disorders', 'Dental Medicine', 'Facial Nerve', 'Facial Plastic Surgery']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,81.0,F

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy man in his 60s presented to a tertiary otolaryngology clinic reporting a 1-year medical history of progressively worsening hoarseness and dyspnea. He denied any history of dysphagia, odynophagia, fevers, unintentional weight loss, cough, or reflux symptoms. There was no prior history of smoking, head and neck surgeries, or radiation exposure. He was treated for asthma with inhaled steroids by his primary care physician without improvement in symptoms. On physical examination, the patient was stridulous and considerably hoarse. His neck examination was unremarkable. Subsequent videostroboscopy revealed severe laryngeal mucosal edema, most significant in the false vocal folds, interarytenoid, and postcricoid regions (Figure 1A). There was right true vocal fold immobility with compensatory squeeze of the false vocal folds and an absent mucosal wave. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the neck with contrast showed irregularity along the free edges of the true vocal folds but no evidence of a neoplasm or cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient underwent urgent direct laryngoscopy with biopsy, which showed edematous, irregular, friable laryngeal mucosa with significant airway narrowing. Laryngeal biopsy findings are shown in Figure 1, B and C. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Blastomycosis,"To form a differential diagnosis for this patient, we must compile a list of potential disorders that could explain the progressively worsening hoarseness, dyspnea, and observed laryngeal abnormalities. We'll consider these possibilities step-by-step:

1. **Laryngeal Carcinoma** - Given the presence of hoarseness, dyspnea, and severe laryngeal edema despite the absence of neoplasm on CT.
2. **Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR)** - Chronic irritation of the larynx and pharynx can lead to edema, although the patient denied reflux symptoms.
3. **Vocal Cord Paralysis** - The immobility of the right true vocal fold could indicate a neurological cause.
4. **Sarcoidosis** - This systemic disease often affects the larynx and could explain the mucosal edema and airway narrowing.
5. **Laryngeal Tuberculosis** - A less common cause of laryngeal mucosal edema, but important to consider, especially without classical systemic symptoms.
6. **Laryngeal Papillomatosis** - Caused by HPV, it could lead to airway obstruction and hoarseness but was not visually confirmed in the biopsy.
7. **Laryngeal Amyloidosis** - Amyloid deposits can lead to progressive hoarseness and dyspnea with mucosal abnormalities.
8. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's Granulomatosis)** - This condition features granulomatous inflammation and could explain the biopsy findings.
9. **Laryngeal Candidiasis** - Immunocompromised patients can develop fungal infections presenting with these symptoms; the patient’s lack of systemic symptoms makes this less likely.
10. **Irritative Laryngitis** - Chronic inflammation due to irritants or allergens, although it usually resolves with the removal of the irritant.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Vocal Cord Paralysis** - The right true vocal fold immobility and compensatory false vocal fold squeeze are key findings.
2. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - The biopsy findings of granulomatous inflammation should make this a high possibility.
3. **Laryngeal Carcinoma** - Despite lack of neoplasm on CT, it should still be considered due to severe symptoms and airway narrowing.
4. **Sarcoidosis** - Fits the biopsy findings and systemic chronicity without systemic symptoms.
5. **Laryngeal Amyloidosis** - Edematous mucosa with no systemic symptoms aligns with this possible diagnosis.
6. **Laryngeal Tuberculosis** - Less likely without systemic symptoms, but still a possibility.
7. **Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR)** - While less likely due to the lack of reflux symptoms and response to commonly used treatments.
8. **Laryngeal Papillomatosis** - Unremarkable neck examination and absence on biopsy reduce the likelihood.
9. **Laryngeal Candidiasis** - Less consistent with the patient's profile and biopsy findings.
10. **Irritative Laryngitis** - Should have responded to the treatment of asthma and appears unlikely considering the progression of the symptoms.","['Fungal Infections', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Laryngology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Critical Care Medicine']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,60.0,M

### INPUT:
A 29-year-old Pakistani woman was referred to the otolaryngology clinic for increased postnasal drip, pharyngitis, odynophagia, cervicalgia, cervical lymphadenopathy, and right-sided otalgia that had persisted for more than a week. She was breastfeeding her 10-month-old, had no history of alcohol use, and had a remote history of hookah use. She was a Southern California native with travel history to Pakistan, Turkey, Jordan, Israel, Qatar, and Dubai 5 years prior to symptom onset. One month prior to onset, she drove from Los Angeles, California, to Houston, Texas. She denied recent unintentional weight loss, cough, fever, night sweats, chills, stridor, dyspnea, dysphonia, or rash. On examination, her vital signs were within normal limits, and physical examination revealed a small right tonsillolith, mild tonsillar erythema that was worse on the right side, and a mobile 2-cm, right level 2 lymph node that was slightly tender to palpation. Laboratory evaluation was notable for an elevated eosinophil count and positive Epstein-Barr immunoglobulin G. Her white blood cell count and mononucleosis spot test result were within normal parameters. Her symptoms persisted despite treatment with penicillin, azithromycin, and steroids from her primary physician and amoxicillin-clavulanate, sinus rinses, fluticasone propionate, and azelastine spray from an otolaryngologist to treat any contributing postnasal drainage and tonsillitis. Flexible transnasal videolaryngoscopy revealed a lesion on the laryngeal surface of the right epiglottis passing midline extending to the right aryepiglottic fold, but not involving the true vocal cords (Figure 1A). Given inconclusive office biopsy results, direct laryngoscopy with biopsy was performed, showing extensively inflamed squamous mucosa with ulceration, granulation tissue, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and atypia (Figure 1B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Coccidioidomycosis,"Let's develop a 10-step differential diagnosis approach based on the provided patient information, proceeding step by step:

1. **Malignancy**: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
2. **Infectious Diseases**: Tuberculosis
3. **Autoimmune Conditions**: Sarcoidosis
4. **Chronic Infections**: Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) reactivation
5. **Benign Neoplastic Conditions**: Laryngeal papillomatosis
6. **Granulomatous Diseases**: Wegener's granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis)
7. **Systemic Diseases**: Sjogren's syndrome
8. **Benign Inflammatory Conditions**: Lichen planus
9. **Fungal Infections**: Histoplasmosis
10. **Allergic Conditions**: Allergic fungal sinusitis (Eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis)

Next, let's re-rank all 10 differential diagnoses using the complete patient's history, physical examination, and test results.

### Re-ranking Analysis:

1. **Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)**: Given the lesion noted on laryngoscopy, the presence of pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and atypia on biopsy, malignancy remains high on the differential.
   
2. **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) reactivation**: Positive EBV IgG and history of lymphadenopathy; however, the patient's symptoms have not improved with conventional treatments.
   
3. **Tuberculosis**: Travel history to endemic areas and persistent lymphadenopathy raise suspicion, despite lack of classic systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, night sweats).

4. **Histoplasmosis**: Travel history and elevated eosinophil count are suggestive; environmental exposure needed verification.
   
5. **Wegener's granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis)**: Upper respiratory tract involvement includes laryngeal and nasal areas; eosinophilia presents but less specific.

6. **Sarcoidosis**: Can cause upper respiratory tract involvement and lymphadenopathy but less likely without systemic symptoms.
   
7. **Laryngeal papillomatosis**: Less likely given ulceration and chronic nature extending to the fold; benign neoplasms are still a possibility.
   
8. **Allergic fungal sinusitis (Eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis)**: Chronic sinusitis and eosinophilia fit, but the laryngeal lesion shifts it down the list.
   
9. **Sjogren's syndrome**: Autoimmune conditions can cause lymphadenopathy and inflammation but lack specificity regarding her symptoms.
   
10. **Lichen planus**: Uncommon involvement of laryngeal mucosa; suggests chronicity but histopathologically distinct.

This differential ranking suggests focusing on further evaluating for malignancy (SCC), infectious causes like TB or fungal infections, and chronic conditions potentially contributing to persistent symptoms and atypical biopsy findings.","['Fungal Infections', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Laryngology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,F

### INPUT:
A 75-year-old woman presented with horizontal binocular diplopia, right-sided ptosis, and a new headache that was progressive over 3 days. She reported difficulty opening her jaw, pain when chewing, and a 2.3-kg weight loss. The week prior, she experienced left-sided ptosis that persisted for 2 days and subsequently resolved. She denied vision changes, eye pain, scalp tenderness, and myalgias. Past medical history included schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and supraventricular tachycardia. Her examination demonstrated normal visual acuity in both eyes. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive. There was right upper-eyelid ptosis. Extraocular motility demonstrated limitation of elevation and abduction bilaterally (Figure 1). Results of dilated fundus examination were normal, and the remainder of her neurologic examination results were normal. Her eye movements and ptosis did not change with fatiguability, rest, or an ice-pack test. Investigations revealed a C-reactive protein level of 292 mg/L (normal, <10 mg/L; to convert to milligrams per deciliter, divide by 10) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 93 mm/h (normal, <30 mm/h). A lumbar puncture demonstrated normal opening pressure, cell count, and glucose and protein levels. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast of the brain demonstrated diffuse edema and enhancement of the scalp, skull base, neck, and paraspinal soft tissues, as well as T2 hyperintensity and enhancement of the extraocular muscles bilaterally. An additional test was obtained, and a diagnosis was made. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Giant cell arteritis,"Let's approach the differential diagnosis step-by-step:

1. **Giant Cell Arteritis**  
   - The elevated inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR) and symptoms like headache, jaw claudication, and weight loss are suggestive.

2. **Myasthenia Gravis**  
   - Considered due to the ptosis and diplopia, though symptoms did not change with fatigue or the ice-pack test, making this less likely.

3. **Thyroid Eye Disease (Graves' Ophthalmopathy)**  
   - The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy could explain the eye movement restrictions and ptosis.

4. **Orbital Cellulitis**  
   - Acute onset with signs of orbital inflammation on MRI, though patient lacks fever and leukocytosis.

5. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome**  
   - Presents with painful ophthalmoplegia due to inflammation in the cavernous sinus or orbital apex, fits some of the imaging findings.

6. **Lymphoma or Metastatic Disease**  
   - Diffuse enhancement and edema of the scalp, skull base, and soft tissues with bilateral extraocular involvement could indicate malignancy.

7. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome (Orbital Pseudotumor)**  
   - Presents with acute painful ophthalmoplegia and enlargement of affected muscles on imaging.

8. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia**  
   - Though typically involves mitochondrial dysfunction causing progressive external ophthalmoplegia, could be considered given muscle involvement.

9. **Sarcoidosis**  
   - Systemic inflammatory disease that can impact the orbits and cranial nerves, presenting similar systemic symptoms and imaging findings.

10. **Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder**  
   - Rarely can cause optic neuritis with extraocular muscle involvement; an anti-aquaporin-4 antibody test would be definitive.

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Giant Cell Arteritis**  
   - Strongly suggested by systemic symptoms, elevated CRP and ESR, and MRI findings.
   
2. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome**  
   - Painful ophthalmoplegia and imaging findings fit well, though inflammatory markers are exceptionally high.
   
3. **Thyroid Eye Disease (Graves' Ophthalmopathy)**  
   - Given history of hypothyroidism and typical imaging findings, must be considered.
   
4. **Lymphoma or Metastatic Disease**  
   - Diffuse enhancement and systemic involvement plausible for metastatic disease.
   
5. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome (Orbital Pseudotumor)**  
   - Presents similarly but doesn’t explain systemic symptoms as well as GCA or malignancy.
   
6. **Myasthenia Gravis**  
   - Less likely due to negative fatigue and ice-pack test results.
   
7. **Sarcoidosis**  
   - Systemic involvement potential but lacks other supporting symptoms or history.
   
8. **Orbital Cellulitis**  
   - Unlikely due to absence of systemic infection signs (fever, leucocytosis).
   
9. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia**  
   - Rare and typically a more chronic presentation, unlikely given acute onset.
   
10. **Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder**  
   - Rare and typically associated with specific antibodies and different symptomatology.

Further testing, particularly a temporal artery biopsy for Giant Cell Arteritis, would help in confirming the diagnosis.","['Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Rheumatology', 'Geriatrics']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,75.0,F

### INPUT:
A 66-year-old African American man presented to the otolaryngology clinic with a several-month history of severe nasal congestion. Five years before this otolaryngology evaluation, the patient developed diffuse skin plaques with erythema and was subsequently diagnosed with hypopigmented cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL, mycosis fungoides type). The patient was treated with a regimen of narrowband UV-B phototherapy and triamcinolone cream, which he has continued for 4 years. Owing to significant worsening of his symptoms 4 months before his evaluation, a biopsy of his cutaneous lesions was performed to rule out progression of CTCL (Figure 1). Physical examination demonstrated large annular plaques with peripheral hyperpigmentation of the body. There were also confluent, indurated pink plaques with slightly raised edges along the forehead, malar eminence, and scalp. The nasal septum demonstrated an inverted V deformity with compromise of the keystone junction. Nasal passages were obstructed with thick mucus and synechiae formation, nearly obstructing the entire nasal passage bilaterally. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Lepromatous leprosy,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL) progression**  
Given the patient's history, it is imperative to consider the progression or transformation of his known CTCL as a potential cause of his worsening symptoms.

2. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener’s Granulomatosis)**  
The thick nasal mucus, nasal passage synechiae, and severe congestion can be indicative of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, an autoimmune condition affecting the respiratory tract.

3. **Sarcoidosis**  
Sarcoidosis can present with similar skin lesions and nasal congestion due to granuloma formation.

4. **Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma**  
This type of carcinoma could account for severe nasal obstruction and skin manifestations if there are metastatic lesions.

5. **Lupus Pernio (associated with Chronic Sarcoidosis)**  
Lupus pernio is a specific manifestation of chronic sarcoidosis, particularly affecting the face and nose.

6. **Leprosy (Hansen’s Disease)**  
Leprosy can cause chronic skin lesions and nasal congestion due to mucosal involvement.

7. **Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyposis**  
This condition presents with severe nasal congestion due to the formation of polyps, contributing to obstructed nasal passages.

8. **Relapsing Polychondritis**  
Relapsing polychondritis can cause nasal cartilage inflammation, leading to congestion and deformities.

9. **Chronic Invasive Fungal Rhinosinusitis**  
Immune-compromised patients, like those on chronic phototherapy, can develop chronic invasive fungal infections leading to nasal congestion and mucosal lesions.

10. **Chronic Allergic Rhinitis**  
A chronic condition that leads to prolonged nasal congestion and mucus production.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL) progression**  
The patient’s past medical history of CTCL makes this the most likely cause. The signs of progression, skin involvement, and nasal congestion fit this diagnosis.

2. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener’s Granulomatosis)**  
Considering the nasal and systemic involvement with the formation of synechiae, this is a strong candidate.

3. **Sarcoidosis**  
The skin findings and nasal congestion align well with sarcoidosis, especially with the known systemic inflammatory nature of the disease.

4. **Relapsing Polychondritis**  
The nasal cartilage involvement and inverted V deformity point towards relapsing polychondritis.

5. **Chronic Invasive Fungal Rhinosinusitis**  
Given the chronicity and the patient’s prolonged immunosuppressive treatment, this remains a significant consideration.

6. **Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma**  
Though less likely, it is a critical diagnosis to rule out, given the severity of nasal symptoms.

7. **Lupus Pernio (associated with Chronic Sarcoidosis)**  
While this is a subtype of sarcoidosis, it remains a separate consideration due to specific facial involvement.

8. **Leprosy (Hansen’s Disease)**  
Though rare, the chronic skin and mucosal involvement necessitates its consideration.

9. **Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyposis**  
Common and plausible, but less likely given the other differential priorities.

10. **Chronic Allergic Rhinitis**  
While this might explain chronic congestion, it does not account for the severe skin findings or nasal deformities.","['Dermatology', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Otolaryngology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,66.0,M

### INPUT:
A 9-year-old boy was referred to a pediatric retina specialist for evaluation of changes in the peripheral retinal pigment epithelium. Ocular history included high hyperopia and amblyopia, and abnormal foveal contour was discovered when he was aged 3 years. Family history was noncontributory. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left. Pupils were round and reactive to light, and intraocular pressure and anterior segment examination were within normal limits. Dilated fundus examination revealed blunted foveal reflexes and abnormal vasculature in the inferonasal quadrant of the right eye. Fluorescein angiography displayed symmetric bilateral circular areas of hypofluorescence around the macula and irregular fovea with no leakage (Figure 1A). Color fundus photography showed symmetric bilateral mottling of the retinal pigment epithelium in the periphery (Figure 1B). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography on initial examination showed an abnormal foveal contour with loss of the foveal pit and intraretinal cystoid cavities within the inner nuclear layer.

### Reasoning for Reranking:

1. **Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy (FEVR):** Strongest match given the retinal abnormalities, high hyperopia, and peripheral retinal pigment epithelium mottling.
2. **X-linked Juvenile Retinoschisis:** Fits well due to abnormal foveal contour, cystoid cavities, and visual acuity reduction.
3. **Stickler Syndrome:** Consistent with high hyperopia, retinal changes, but typically associated with a broader set of systemic features which are not noted here.
4. **Congenital Stationary Night Blindness (CSNB):** Could explain foveal abnormalities and visual issues but does not fully account for the retinal pigment epithelium changes.
5. **Coats' Disease:** Less likely due to lack of exudation and typical vascular abnormalities.
6. **Best’s Disease:** Bilateral symmetrical foveal changes suggestive of maculopathy but less so than higher-ranked conditions.
7. **Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP):** Unlikely given lack of premature birth history.
8. **Goldmann-Favre Syndrome:** Can cause foveal cysts and retinal abnormalities but less typical presentation.
9. **Leber Congenital Amaurosis:** Severe early visual impairment without clear cause in this case.
10. **Oculocutaneous Albinism:** Least likely due to no mention of systemic albinism traits and typical ocular findings.","['Retinal Disorders', 'Pediatrics', 'Ophthalmology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,M

### INPUT:
A 3-year-old boy presented with a vascular lesion involving the left orbit and face. He had a pink macule on his left cheek at birth, which became raised and discolored around age 3 to 4 weeks. He was diagnosed with a capillary hemangioma, and propranolol was started at age 1 month with progression despite dosage increases. Topical timolol was tried without improvement; oral prednisolone decreased the size of the lesion, but was poorly tolerated and discontinued. An ophthalmic evaluation at an outside hospital was concerning for amblyopia because of anisohypermetropia, greater on the left, and a left esotropia and hypertropia. A magnetic resonance image revealed an orbital mass surrounding the left lateral rectus muscle with mass effect on the globe and extension into the eyelid, pterygopalatine fossa, and cheek. Given the risk of amblyopia, the patient underwent 2 embolization and debulking procedures of the orbital and cheek components of the lesion, which were positive for glucose transporter 1 on pathology. However, the esotropia abruptly worsened after the second debulking. At age 3 years, he presented to the clinic with a persistent cheek and orbit lesion, dense amblyopia, large-angle monocular esotropia and hypertropia, and proptosis of the left eye. The left extraocular muscle showed inability to abduct past midline (Figure 1A). A repeated magnetic resonance image showed persistent orbital involvement causing medial displacement of the lateral rectus muscle and mass effect on the globe (Figure 1B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Infantile hemangioma,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Infantile Hemangioma**: The initial presentation of a pink macule at birth that becomes raised and discolored aligns well with the characteristics of an infantile hemangioma.

2. **Capillary Malformation**: Given the persistent vascular lesion and facial involvement, a capillary malformation (i.e., port-wine stain) might be considered.

3. **Lymphatic Malformation**: The non-responsiveness to propranolol and topical timolol, with a lesion that continues to grow, suggests a lymphatic malformation could be present.

4. **Venous Malformation**: Similar to lymphatic malformations, venous malformations can present with progressive growth and might be considered given the lesion's persistence and involvement of surrounding structures.

5. **Rhabdomyosarcoma**: The progressive nature of the lesion with orbital involvement and mass effect on the globe warrants consideration of a malignant orbital tumor like rhabdomyosarcoma.

6. **Neurofibroma**: A benign tumor often associated with neurofibromatosis, which can cause similar orbital involvement and affect surrounding structures.

7. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**: Known to cause bone and soft tissue lesions, including those around the eye, and may present with similar aggressive features.

8. **Orbital Cellulitis**: Proptosis and eyelid involvement raise concerns for an infectious etiology such as orbital cellulitis, although less likely given the chronicity and progression.

9. **Thyroid Eye Disease**: Although rare in very young children, the orbital involvement, and extraocular muscle restriction could be indicative of thyroid eye disease.

10. **Dermoid Cyst**: A benign congenital lesion that could present similarly with proptosis and orbital involvement.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Infantile Hemangioma**: Strongly supported given histopathology with glucose transporter 1 positivity, common in infantile hemangiomas.
  
2. **Lymphatic Malformation**: Given the continued growth and complexity, a lymphatic malformation remains a strong differential.

3. **Venous Malformation**: Persistent growth and inadequate response to typical hemangioma treatments may point toward a venous malformation.

4. **Capillary Malformation**: Although less likely given the growth pattern, capillary malformations can sometimes present variably.

5. **Rhabdomyosarcoma**: Malignant process aligns with rapid progression and mass effect; should be ruled out conclusively.

6. **Neurofibroma**: Benign lesion capable of causing extensive involvement of orbital structures, seen in neurofibromatosis.

7. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**: Requires consideration due to similar lesion characteristics.

8. **Dermoid Cyst**: Congenital cystic lesions might still be differentiated given the orbital findings.

9. **Thyroid Eye Disease**: Less likely in a 3-year-old but should not be completely ruled out due to orbital signs.

10. **Orbital Cellulitis**: Chronicity makes infectious cause less likely, but orbital cellulitis should be considered in differential diagnostic processes.

### Summary:
Upon final review with available imaging, histopathology, and clinical findings, **Infantile Hemangioma** remains the most consistent diagnosis supported by the Glucose Transporter 1 (GLUT1) positive pathology.","['Dermatology', 'Pediatrics', 'Cutaneous Vascular Malformations', 'External Eye Disease', 'Ophthalmology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.0,M

### INPUT:
A 59-year-old elementary school principal with a history of cholecystectomy and appendectomy and no use of alcohol, illicit drugs, or cigarettes presented to the emergency department for the fourth time in 3 months with diffuse abdominal pain not associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, hematochezia, weight loss, fever, or anorexia. On physical examination, the patient had normal vital signs, mild diffuse abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding, and bluish pigmentation along his gingival margin (Figure, panel A). Blood testing showed alanine aminotransferase level 51 U/L (0.85 μkat/L; reference range, 7-23 U/L [0.12-0.38 μkat/L]), aspartate aminotransaminase 68 U/L (1.14 μkat/L; reference range, 13-30 U/L [0.22-0.50 μkat/L]), total bilirubin 3.2 mg/dL (54.73 μmol/L; reference range, 0.4-1.5 mg/dL [6.84-25.66 μmol/L]) and direct bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL (15.39 μmol/L; reference range, 0.0-0.4 mg/dL [0.0-6.84 μmol/L]). Hemoglobin level was 8.7 g/dL with a normal mean corpuscular volume, and ferritin level was 637.9 ng/mL (reference range, 39.9-465 ng/mL). Blood testing revealed normal lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, iron, vitamin B12, folate, zinc, and copper levels, and results of urinalysis were normal. A peripheral blood smear demonstrated small, bluish-purple punctate inclusions in erythrocytes (Figure, panel B). Results of upper and lower endoscopy and abdominal-pelvic computed tomography performed within the past 3 months were unremarkable.

7. **Thalassemia**
8. **Lupus Erythematosus**
9. **Iron Deficiency Anemia**
10. **Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information:

1. **Lead Poisoning**
   - The bluish pigmentation along the gingival margin (Burton's line) and the small, bluish-purple punctate inclusions in erythrocytes (basophilic stippling) are classic features of lead poisoning. Elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels can also be seen in lead poisoning.

2. **Porphyria**
   - Although typically associated with abdominal pain, porphyria can manifest with other symptoms that are not present in this patient such as neurological or dermatological signs.

3. **Hemochromatosis**
   - Elevated ferritin levels and liver enzyme abnormalities could suggest hemochromatosis, but this condition often involves iron overload and deposition, which normal iron levels and lacking characteristic symptoms make less probable here.

4. **Wilson's Disease**
   - Considered due to liver abnormalities but less likely due to lack of Kayser-Fleischer rings, neurological symptoms, and normal copper levels.

5. **Chronic Liver Disease**
   - Elevated liver function tests and bilirubin levels could suggest some form of chronic liver disease, but this diagnosis does not explain the noted pigmentation and basophilic stippling. 

6. **Hemolytic Anemia**
   - Hemolytic anemia could explain the bilirubin and hemoglobin levels but is less likely due to normal haptoglobin and lack of other supporting evidence.

7. **Thalassemia**
   - Although it involves anemia, normally it's more associated with microcytosis and isn't suggested by current findings.

8. **Lupus Erythematosus**
   - This autoimmune disease can present with a wide variety of symptoms including hematologic abnormalities but isn't suggested by the specific findings in this case.

9. **Iron Deficiency Anemia**
   - This is less likely due to the elevated ferritin levels and absence of other characteristic findings such as low iron levels or microcytic anemia.

10. **Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis**
    - This chronic liver disease was considered due to elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin, however, it typically involves more significant cholestatic liver enzyme pattern and biliary abnormalities.

Given the patient's symptoms, their physical and laboratory findings, and the classic features such as Burton's line and basophilic stippling, **Lead Poisoning** remains the most likely diagnosis.","['Complementary and Alternative Medicine', 'Gastroenterology', 'Hematology', 'Toxicology', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,59.0,M

### INPUT:
A 50-year-old man was referred for ophthalmoplegia that developed immediately after an 8.5-hour robotic cystectomy for small cell cancer of the bladder. After recovering from anesthesia in the postanesthesia care unit, he experienced headache, facial numbness, inability to open both his eyes, and inability to move both eyes in any direction. He had a known enhancing central skull base lesion in sella turcica with compression of the optic chiasm and mild mass effect on the pons that was felt to be a pituitary macroadenoma (Figure). His baseline examination before the cystectomy showed visual acuity of 20/20 OU with intact extraocular movements and unremarkable confrontational fields, although a mild bitemporal hemianopia was seen on automated visual fields.

6. **Thyroid Eye Disease**
7. **Multiple Sclerosis**
8. **Myasthenia Gravis**
9. **Migraine with Ophthalmoplegia**
10. **Guillain-Barré Syndrome**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results:
1. **Pituitary Apoplexy** - Given the known pituitary macroadenoma with the clinical presentation of abrupt headache, ophthalmoplegia, and facial numbness post-surgery, pituitary apoplexy is highly suspected.
2. **Brainstem Stroke** - The sudden onset of neurological symptoms including ophthalmoplegia and facial numbness could be attributed to a stroke, especially with history of mass effect on the pons.
3. **Cavernous Sinus Syndrome** - The involvement of multiple cranial nerves affecting eye movement and facial sensation fits this syndrome possibility.
4. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome** - Painful ophthalmoplegia involving multiple cranial nerves could suggest this inflammatory condition, though the suddenness and lack of chronic symptoms make this less likely.
5. **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula** - This presents with abrupt and severe ophthalmoplegia, though typically also includes proptosis and bruit, which are not mentioned.
6. **Myasthenia Gravis** - While possible, the acute onset post-surgery and headache are atypical for this autoimmune neuromuscular condition.
7. **Multiple Sclerosis** - MS could cause ophthalmoplegia, but the patient's age and new, acute, post-surgical presentation make this less likely.
8. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - The presentation of ophthalmoplegia could fit, but the presence of headache and facial numbness is less consistent.
9. **Guillain-Barré Syndrome** - This syndrome can cause rapidly progressive paralysis, including cranial nerve involvement, but typically starts with peripheral weakness.
10. **Migraine with Ophthalmoplegia** - The symptoms could fit an ophthalmoplegic migraine, but this is rare and less likely given the acute context and known mass.

Given the patient's detailed clinical history, including the presence of a pituitary macroadenoma with mass effect and sudden onset of symptoms post-surgery, **Pituitary Apoplexy** remains the leading hypothesis.","['Neurology', 'Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Surgery', 'Surgical Oncology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,50.0,M

### INPUT:
A 9-year-old girl was referred to the pediatric retina service to evaluate progressive vision loss. Her medical history included neonatal seizures. She was initially evaluated at an outside institution and was found to have bilateral symmetric vision loss with nyctalopia. The onset of the symptoms was unknown. At that time, her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/70 OU. The patient did not receive any ophthalmological care until 2 years later, when she was seen for marked vision loss and was noted to have a BCVA of light perception in both eyes. When she presented to the pediatric retina service, she demonstrated poor mentation and was unable to recall simple things such as the name of her siblings. Her BCVA was light perception. Her pupils were round and reactive. The anterior segment examination and intraocular pressures were within normal limits. Fundus autofluorescence disclosed attenuated, narrow vasculature and diffuse peripheral patchy hypoautofluorescence (Figure 1A). Color fundus photography showed optic disc pallor, attenuated retinal vasculature, prominent choroidal markings, and central retinal atrophy with diffusely mottled pigmentation (Figure 1B). Optical coherence tomography displayed decreased retinal thickness, more prominent in the inner layers, and hyper-reflective dots in the outer retinal layers. Family history included unilateral vision loss in her paternal grandmother in her late 20s. Both parents were healthy and denied consanguinity. The patient has 3 half sisters, all of whom are healthy.

1. **Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP)**
   - Progressive vision loss, nyctalopia, attenuated retinal vasculature, diffuse peripheral patchy hypoautofluorescence, and family history of vision loss.

2. **Leber's Congenital Amaurosis (LCA)**
   - Severe vision loss from an early age, very poor BCVA, attenuated retinal vessels, and pigmentary changes.

3. **Stargardt Disease**
   - Progressive central vision loss, fundus appearance with mottled pigmentation, BCVA light perception.

4. **Batten Disease (Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis)**
   - Progressive vision loss, cognitive decline, poor mentation, neonatal seizures.

5. **Cone-Rod Dystrophy**
   - Progressive vision loss affecting both central and peripheral vision, with pigmentary changes and decreased retinal thickness.

6. **Metachromatic Leukodystrophy**
   - Progressive vision loss, cognitive decline, neonatal seizures, retinal changes.

7. **Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (Spielmeyer-Vogt-Sjögren Disease)**
   - Vision loss, cognitive decline, seizures, and retinal abnormalities.

8. **Bardet-Biedl Syndrome**
   - Vision loss, attenuated retinal vasculature, pigmentation changes, cognitive and developmental delay, although there is no mention of other characteristic features like polydactyly or obesity.

9. **Mitochondrial Optic Neuropathies (e.g., LHON)**
   - Vision loss, optic disc pallor, maternal inheritance pattern.

10. **Kearns-Sayre Syndrome**
    - Vision loss, pigmentary retinopathy, cognitive issues, progressive external ophthalmoplegia (though no mention of ophthalmoplegia here, it’s a systemic consideration).

Next, we will rerank these based on all the patient information and test results.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Batten Disease (Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis)**
   - Fits the progressive vision loss, cognitive decline, seizures, and characteristic retinal changes.

2. **Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (Spielmeyer-Vogt-Sjögren Disease)**
   - Closely related to Batten Disease with similar features including vision loss and cognitive decline.

3. **Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP)**
   - Progressive vision loss, nyctalopia, and retinal vascular attenuation with family history.

4. **Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis (LCA)**
   - Severe early vision loss and attenuated retinal vasculature.

5. **Cone-Rod Dystrophy**
   - Progressive vision loss involving both central and peripheral vision, retinal atrophy, and pigmentary changes.

6. **Metachromatic Leukodystrophy**
   - Progressive vision loss, cognitive decline, and seizures with supporting retinal changes.

7. **Stargardt Disease**
   - Progressive vision loss marked by patchy/degraded retinal pigmentation and atrophy.

8. **Bardet-Biedl Syndrome**
   - Vision loss and pigmentary retinal changes with cognitive decline, though lacking some systemic features.

9. **Mitochondrial Optic Neuropathies (e.g., LHON)**
   - Optic disc pallor and family history, but less emphasis on cognitive changes.

10. **Kearns-Sayre Syndrome**
    - Systemic mitochondrial disease fitting the optic changes but missing some other clinical signs.

A 67-year-old man presented to his primary care physician with new-onset pain and erythema of his left eye and left ear, cough for 1 month, and a 9-kg weight loss over the past 3 months. Twelve months prior, he experienced a self-limited episode of right eye pain and redness, and 2 months later, a similar episode occurred in his left eye. He reported no fevers, chills, headaches, visual changes, hearing loss, hoarseness, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, arthralgias, or rash. Physical examination revealed normal vital signs, and no abnormalities on nasal, cardiopulmonary, joint, and skin examination. His left eye had scleral erythema, and the cartilaginous portion of his left ear was swollen and erythematous (Figure). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Relapsing polychondritis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Relapsing Polychondritis**: Given the episodic nature of the eye and ear inflammation and the evidence of cartilage involvement, relapsing polychondritis should be strongly considered.

2. **Giant Cell Arteritis**: Considering the patient's age, weight loss, and inflammatory symptoms, we should consider giant cell arteritis.

3. **Sarcoidosis**: This systemic condition can present with uveitis and systemic symptoms like cough and weight loss.

4. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (GPA)**: This vasculitis can affect the respiratory tract and eyes, presenting with similar symptoms.

5. **Infectious Causes (e.g., Tuberculosis)**: A chronic cough and systemic symptoms warrant consideration of infectious causes, including tuberculosis.

6. **Lymphoma**: Systemic symptoms like weight loss and persistent cough raise the suspicion of lymphoma.

7. **IgG4-related Disease**: This can present with systemic inflammation, including eye and ear involvement.

8. **Syphilis**: Consideration should be given to syphilis due to its broad systemic manifestations that can include ocular and auricular symptoms.

9. **Cogan's Syndrome**: Presents with systemic inflammation that can affect the eyes and ears, aligning with the patient's presentation.

10. **Behçet’s Disease**: It can present with systemic symptoms, including ocular inflammation, though it is less likely without other mucocutaneous symptoms.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Relapsing Polychondritis**: The episodic nature of the inflammatory symptoms specifically involving cartilage strongly suggests this.
2. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (GPA)**: The combination of systemic symptoms with respiratory tract and eye involvement makes this a close second.
3. **Sarcoidosis**: Given the uveitis, cough, and weight loss, sarcoidosis is a strong consideration.
4. **Giant Cell Arteritis**: Age and weight loss make this a differential to keep in mind.
5. **Lymphoma**: The significant weight loss and systemic symptoms warrant consideration of malignancy.
6. **IgG4-related Disease**: Systemic inflammation including eye and ear involvement supports this possibility.
7. **Infectious Causes (e.g., Tuberculosis)**: Needs to be ruled out with appropriate testing due to the chronic cough and systemic symptoms.
8. **Cogan's Syndrome**: Though rarer, the presentation fits with the ocular and auricular involvement.
9. **Syphilis**: Consider if other diagnoses are ruled out.
10. **Behçet’s Disease**: Lacks other typical mucocutaneous manifestations but remains a consideration.

### Final Evaluation
Given the recurrent inflammation specifically affecting the cartilage of the eye and ear, relapsing polychondritis remains the most likely diagnosis and should be the focus of initial diagnostic and therapeutic efforts.","['Ophthalmology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Rheumatology', 'Otology', 'Geriatrics']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,67.0,M

### INPUT:
An 88-year-old woman presented with persistent subretinal fluid (SRF) and enlarging pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) in each eye following 32 near monthly injections of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Ocular history included presumed exudative age-related macular degeneration. Central serous chorioretinopathy was also suspected secondary to the presence of yellow subretinal deposits located within an inferior macular detachment in the right eye. Visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS. She had pseudophakia with an otherwise normal anterior segment examination in each eye. Fundus examination was remarkable for macular PEDs and SRF in each eye. There was an epiretinal membrane in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the right eye disclosed a central PED with SRF that extended beyond the inferior border of the PED (Figure, A). Hyperreflective foci, suggestive of vitelliform material, were visible on the photoreceptors. OCT in the left eye demonstrated 2 PEDs in the parafovea (Figure, B). SRF was present with overlying thickening of the photoreceptors. The choroid was thin in each eye. Fluorescein angiography revealed punctate hyperfluorescent staining within the body of the PEDs in each eye. There was no evidence of leakage in either eye. Fundus autofluorescence displayed dispersed, speckled hyperautofluorescence corresponding to the potential vitelliform material and SRF in the right eye. Review of the autofluorescence 3 years prior revealed boat-shaped hyperautofluorescence located in the most inferior aspect of the SRF in the right eye. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Immunogammopathy-associated maculopathy,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps

**Step 1:** Exudative Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
- Considered due to persistent subretinal fluid, pigment epithelial detachments, and response to anti-VEGF therapy.

**Step 2:** Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC)
- Suspected due to yellow subretinal deposits and the presence of SRF without significant leakage on angiography.

**Step 3:** Adult-Onset Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy (AVMD)
- Hyperreflective foci suggestive of vitelliform material are indicative.

**Step 4:** Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV)
- Considered due to chronic cycles of leakage and resolution potentially overlooked in previous angiography.

**Step 5:** Idiopathic Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (IPCV)
- Differentiates from PCV, focusing on idiopathic nature and progression without specific triggering events.

**Step 6:** Chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (cCSC)
- Chronic condition leading to prolonged SRF presence and poor response to anti-VEGF therapy.

**Step 7:** Pattern Dystrophy
- Exhibits hyperautofluorescence and presence of vitelliform material.

**Step 8:** Multifocal Choroiditis (MFC)
- Can present with punctate hyperfluorescent spots and pigment alterations.

**Step 9:** Pachychoroid Spectrum Disorders
- Includes diseases involving thickened choroid but excludes as choroid is noted thin in the case.

**Step 10:** Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) secondary to other causes
- Excludes primary AMD and CSC for broader secondary neovascularization considering choroidal changes.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

**1. Exudative Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**
- Persistent SRF, PEDs, efficacy of anti-VEGF.

**2. Adult-Onset Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy (AVMD)**
- Hyperreflective foci of vitelliform material on OCT.

**3. Chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (cCSC)**
- Persistent SRF, resistant to anti-VEGF, yellow subretinal deposits.

**4. Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV)**
- Chronic recurrent SRF, characteristic subretinal lesions, potentially missed angiographic signs.

**5. Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC)**
- SRF presence, yellow deposits, however, typically more responsive to natural regression or laser treatments than in the described course.

**6. Pattern Dystrophy**
- Hyperautofluorescent vitelliform material, thick photoreceptors.

**7. Idiopathic Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (IPCV)**
- Differs from PCV in terms of idiopathy and presentation without direct prior triggering cause.

**8. Multifocal Choroiditis (MFC)**
- Punctate hyperfluorescent spots, chronic condition mimicking described symptoms.

**9. Pachychoroid Spectrum Disorders**
- Initially considered but deprioritized due to thin choroid on OCT.

**10. Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) secondary to other causes**
- Excludes primary AMD and CSC. Broader secondary etiology considering long-standing disease progression and refractory nature to anti-VEGF.","['Oncology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Retinal Disorders', 'Hematology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,88.0,F

### INPUT:
A White man in his 70s with a medical history notable only for mitral valve repair was incidentally found to have cervical lymphadenopathy on magnetic resonance imaging while undergoing workup for shoulder pain. A fine-needle biopsy of an enlarged left-sided cervical lymph node yielded benign results. One month later, he presented to a local emergency department with diffuse abdominal pain. Symptoms began 6 weeks earlier and had been intermittent in nature. He had also experienced fatigue, night sweats, decreased appetite, and weight loss for 6 weeks. He otherwise denied having fevers, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or easy bruising. Physical examination revealed bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy in addition to mild diffuse abdominal pain. Laboratory results revealed a hemoglobin level of 13.1 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10), a white blood cell count of 6.4 × 103/μL, and a platelet count of 404 × 103/μL  (to convert to × 109/L, multiply by 1) in addition to negative results for HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C assays. Additional workup results were notable for elevated levels of interleukin (IL) 10 (1091 pg/mL), IL-6 (3.1 pg/mL), C-reactive protein (4.9 mg/dL [to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10]), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (79 mm/h). A computed tomography scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis further revealed extensive cervical, supraclavicular, retroperitoneal, pelvic, and inguinal lymphadenopathy, with extensive inflammation and fat stranding adjacent to these enlarged nodes. Positron emission tomography–computed tomography further demonstrated fluorodeoxyglucose-avid lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm. The patient then underwent excisional biopsy of an enlarged right cervical lymph node (Figure).

9. **Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease**  
10. **Reactive Lymphadenopathy**

### Re-ranked Differential Diagnoses Based on Full Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Castleman Disease**  
Reason: Cervical and extensive lymphadenopathy, elevated IL-6 and IL-10, inflammatory markers, associated systemic symptoms (fatigue, weight loss, night sweats).

2. **Lymphoma**  
Reason: Fluorodeoxyglucose-avid lymph nodes, extensive lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms (night sweats, weight loss).

3. **Metastatic Carcinoma**  
Reason: Extensive lymphadenopathy could point to metastatic spread, though lack of primary tumor identification is a challenge.

4. **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)**  
Reason: Common cause of generalized lymphadenopathy in elderly, but normal WBC count makes it less likely here.

5. **Sarcoidosis**  
Reason: Can present with diffuse lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms but less likely without pulmonary involvement.

6. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**  
Reason: Can present with lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms, yet other classical symptoms of SLE are missing.

7. **Tuberculosis (Extrapulmonary)**  
Reason: Might present with lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms but negative test results for infectious diseases make it less likely.

8. **Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease**  
Reason: Can cause lymphadenopathy and systemic inflammatory response, more common in younger patients and generally self-limiting.

9. **Infectious Mononucleosis**  
Reason: Typically associated with fever, sore throat, more common in younger individuals; benign biopsy makes this less likely.

10. **Reactive Lymphadenopathy**  
Reason: Non-specific inflammatory response could cause it, but doesn't explain the extensive systemic symptoms and abnormal laboratory markers seen in this patient.

### INPUT:
A woman in her 40s presented with painful erythematous plaques on her trunk (Figure, A). Skin lesions developed 2 months earlier and progressively spread. She reported abdominal discomfort, weight loss, and vaginal bleeding. A solid mass on her lower abdomen that had been palpable about 10 years prior had rapidly increased in size within the past few months. Physical examination revealed erythematous plaques on the right chest and flank without warmth. Punch biopsy of a lesion from the chest was sent for histopathological examination (Figure, B and C). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Metastatic carcinoma,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis Process:
1. **Cutaneous metastasis** (given the erythematous plaques and history of a palpable mass that has recently grown).
2. **Erythema nodosum** (due to painful erythematous lesions on the skin but lacks warmth which is somewhat uncharacteristic).
3. **Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans** (another condition that presents with plaques on the skin and potentially linked to a mass).
4. **Pyoderma gangrenosum** (considering the painful nature of the plaques, though warmth is often a feature).
5. **Cutaneous lymphoma** (presenting as plaques on the skin and associated systemic symptoms).
6. **Systemic lupus erythematosus** (known for erythematous plaques, yet the presentation seems more localized and without the classic lupus features).
7. **Lobomycosis** (skin disease presenting with plaques, particularly when there is a chronic lesion history).
8. **Necrobiosis lipoidica** (can present with erythematous plaques typically on the lower extremities but possibly in other areas).
9. **Sarcoidosis** (can present with plaques and systemic symptoms but erythema and plaques are typical).
10. **Psoriasis** (though typically presenting with well-defined plaques, the systemic symptoms do not match).

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Cutaneous metastasis**: Strongly considered due to the progression and history of an abdominal mass.
2. **Cutaneous lymphoma**: Given systemic symptoms and skin lesions.
3. **Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans**: due to its characteristic skin lesions and potentially misleading history of a mass.
4. **Pyoderma gangrenosum**: Painful nature of plaques but lacking warmth.
5. **Erythema nodosum**: Though common, the warmth is usually a feature, and systemic symptoms may correlate.
6. **Sarcoidosis**: Systemic involvement and skin lesions.
7. **Systemic lupus erythematosus**: Erythematous plaques considered but less likely.
8. **Lobomycosis**: Given the chronic presentation and lesions.
9. **Necrobiosis lipoidica**: Systemic symptoms do not favor it.
10. **Psoriasis**: Generally identified by more classic skin presentation.

### Analysis Summary:
The patient's history, physical examination, and biopsy results strongly suggest Cutaneous metastasis as the leading diagnosis, with other conditions less likely based on the presentation and system involvement.

Further confirmation would depend on histopathology results which would likely reveal metastasis from a primary malignancy to complete the diagnosis.","['Dermatology', 'Oncology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,40.0,F

### INPUT:
A man aged 44 years was referred for progressive parkinsonism with poor levodopa response. His medical history comprised unexplained sensory hearing loss, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. At age 23 years, he had bilateral cataract surgery, and over the last 2 years, he developed worsening stiffness and walking difficulties with frequent falls. He reported features of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome (RLS), visual daytime hallucinations, and rapid cognitive decline. He was given levodopa/benserazide (up to 200 mg/50 mg 4 times daily) without improvement on his Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale scores. Therefore, his dopaminergic medication was ceased. Family history was negative for movement or developmental disorders. His neurologic examination showed hypomimia, symmetrical bradykinesia, and rigidity of the extremities without tremors (Video). There was full range of eye movements with large-amplitude saccadic intrusions on smooth pursuit in all directions. Neuropsychological assessment revealed significant abnormalities in cognitive functioning, affecting verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills (ie, speed of information processing, visuospatial skills, verbal and visual memory loss, executive skills). Mini-Mental Status Examination score was 26 of 30 points. Systemic examination was unremarkable. Laboratory and cerebral spinal fluid testing (ie, paraneoplastic antibodies Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, Ma2, amphiphysin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, N-methyl-d-aspartic acid, LGI1, and Caspr2, 14-3-3 protein) were normal. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild frontal and parietal atrophy. An electroencephalogram demonstrated slowing in keeping with moderate generalized encephalopathy. Total-body positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as a tracer showed no FDG-avid lesions; however, a subsequent brain-specific FDG-PET/MRI revealed hypometabolism throughout the left cerebral hemisphere and crossed cerebellar diaschisis (Figure 1). As the patient’s cognitive function and parkinsonism had deteriorated rapidly, a brain biopsy of the left frontal cortex was done. Immunohistochemistry showed scattered globular inclusions consistent with Lewy bodies.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Lewy Body Dementia (LBD)**: Strong support from Lewy bodies found in brain biopsy, cognitive decline, visual hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder.
2. **Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)**: Progressive parkinsonism, poor levodopa response, autonomic dysfunction fits but lacks support from biopsy.
3. **Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)**: Progressive course, falls, and stiffness, but typical eye movement findings for PSP are lacking.
4. **Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD)**: Consider due to asymmetrical cortical signs but less likely given the bilateral symptoms.
5. **Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD)**: Rapid cognitive decline might suggest FTD; however, the parkinsonism aspect and lack of specific atrophy findings on MRI makes it less likely.
6. **Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)**: Rapid cognitive decline fits but other supportive lab findings like 14-3-3 protein are negative.
7. **Wilson's Disease**: Consider neuropsychiatric symptoms, but patient age and lack of hepatic findings make it less likely.
8. **Huntington's Disease**: Cognitive decline and movement disorder could fit but negative family history and onset age make it less probable.
9. **Neuroferritinopathy**: Fits due to movement disorder and cognitive decline, but no family history or iron metabolism indicators.
10. **Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA)**: Movement disorder fits, but typically has a genetic component and specific cerebellar atrophy not seen here.

### INPUT:
A 53-year-old woman presented to the emergency department after awakening with right preauricular and right upper neck swelling. She had a history of coronary artery disease and prior myocardial infarction that was treated with warfarin. She denied any personal or family history of cancer. She was previously briefly a smoker. A physical examination revealed no erythema or tenderness of the parotid. Her cranial nerves were intact, specifically the right facial nerve and its branches. The oral mucosa was intact with no epithelial lesions. Urinalysis results revealed slight hematuria. Her international normalized ratio (INR) was 4.4. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed an ill-defined infiltrative mass centered in the deep lobe of the right parotid with extension into surrounding soft tissue spaces (Figure, A). A follow-up CT was performed 6 weeks later (Figure, B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Parotid gland hemorrhage,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Parotid Gland Tumor**  
   Justification: Presence of an ill-defined mass in the parotid gland region on CT scan suggests the possibility of a neoplastic process, which is a leading consideration given the imaging findings.

2. **Parotitis**  
   Justification: Although there is no erythema or tenderness and her cranial nerves are intact, parotitis (inflammation of the parotid gland) could potentially account for the swelling.

3. **Salivary Gland Stone (Sialolithiasis)**  
   Justification: Sialolithiasis often leads to swelling of the salivary gland and can present without evident infection or severe pain.

4. **Hematoma**  
   Justification: With an elevated INR of 4.4, the patient is at risk for spontaneous bleeding, which could lead to a hematoma presenting as swelling.

5. **Lymphadenopathy**  
   Justification: Swelling in the right preauricular and upper neck regions could potentially be due to enlarged lymph nodes from various etiologies, including reactive or neoplastic causes.

6. **Abscess**  
   Justification: Though there is no tenderness or erythema, the presence of a mass on imaging could potentially be due to a developing abscess.

7. **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in the Jugular Vein**  
   Justification: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and anticoagulation therapy heightens her risk for vascular complications, including jugular vein thrombosis which can present with neck swelling.

8. **Neck Mass Secondary to Metastasis**  
   Justification: While she has no personal or family history of cancer, metastatic disease could still be a potential, albeit lower likelihood, cause of the observed mass.

9. **Carotid Body Tumor**  
   Justification: This is a rare paraganglioma that can present as an ill-defined mass in the neck and should be considered in differential diagnostics.

10. **Parapharyngeal Space Infection**  
    Justification: Infections in deep neck spaces can present with significant swelling and imaging abnormalities; the mass on initial imaging could be due to such an infection even in the absence of overt clinical signs.

### Final Rerank of Differential Diagnosis Using All Information and Test Results

1. **Hematoma**  
   High INR (4.4) strongly suggests the likelihood of spontaneous bleeding resulting in a hematoma.

2. **Parotid Gland Tumor**  
   Imaging findings of an ill-defined infiltrative mass strongly indicate a neoplastic process, pending further diagnostic confirmation.

3. **Lymphadenopathy**  
   Common cause of neck masses; needs further evaluation to determine if due to infection, inflammatory, or malignancy-related causes.

4. **Abscess**  
   Despite clinically missing erythema or marked tenderness, an abscess remains a potential diagnosis given imaging findings.

5. **Parotitis**  
   Although not manifesting typical signs of erythema or tenderness, inflammation of the gland remains a conceivable diagnosis.

6. **Salivary Gland Stone (Sialolithiasis)**  
   Can cause significant gland swelling but less likely given mass appearance on CT.

7. **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in the Jugular Vein**  
   Less likely but still possible due to patient's history of cardiovascular issues and anticoagulation therapy.

8. **Neck Mass Secondary to Metastasis**  
   Has a lower probability due to absence of personal and family cancer history, but not completely negligible.

9. **Carotid Body Tumor**  
   Rare but possible; needs further specialized imaging studies to confirm.

10. **Parapharyngeal Space Infection**  
    Lower on the differential list due to absence of overt clinical infection signs but remains in consideration due to imaging abnormalities.","['Salivary Gland Disorders', 'Anticoagulation', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Otolaryngology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,53.0,F

### INPUT:
An 18-year-old male presented to the primary care physician with a 4-month history of a slowly progressive painless lateral neck mass on the right side. The patient denied any history of dysphagia, dysphonia, drainage, previous neck surgery, trauma, or recent fever. There was no significant medical or family history of thyroid disease. On examination, the mass moved with swallowing. The patient had normal thyroid stimulating hormone and calcium levels and a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 63 pg/mL. Neck ultrasonography revealed a well-circumscribed anechoic lesion with a diameter of 5.9 cm in the right thyroid lobe without any internal solid nodularity or septation. A neck computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an intrathyroidal lesion extending inferiorly to 3 cm above the angle of Louis causing tracheal compression and displacement (Figure, A). The patient underwent right hemithyroidectomy to relieve tracheal compression. A near-infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF) camera yielded a homogenously dim lesion (Figure, B). Pathologic examination confirmed a normal right thyroid lobe, a normal right parathyroid gland, and a cystic lesion at the inferior pole with no evidence of malignant disease in the specimen. The tissue inside the lesion stained positive for PTH. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Parathyroid cyst,"Based on the provided patient presentation, examination findings, imaging results, and pathology findings, we can build a differential diagnosis list. Here’s a step-by-step approach to arrive at a prioritized differential diagnosis:

1. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**: Common in younger patients, typically midline, and may move with swallowing or tongue protrusion. Although the described mass is lateral, it is necessary to consider this due to its origin.
 
2. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**: A congenital epithelial cyst that usually presents as a painless, fluctuant mass on the lateral neck, fits the description of the slowly progressive painless mass.

3. **Parathyroid Cyst**: Given the lesion's positive PTH staining, it’s critical to consider a parathyroid cyst, which typically presents as a neck mass and can cause tracheal compression.

4. **Thyroid Cyst**: Although less common to present as compressive symptoms extending to the angle of Louis, this diagnosis should be considered due to the lesion's location and involvement with the thyroid.

5. **Lymphangioma**: These are usually congenital and can present as a painless mass. They may be identified by specific imaging characteristics.

6. **Thyroid Adenoma**: Benign tumors of the thyroid gland can present as painless masses and may coexist with cystic components, though usually solid.

7. **Dermoid Cyst**: These may appear in the neck and are typically benign, containing various tissue elements. However, they are often midline rather than lateral.

8. **Thymic Cyst**: While often found in the mediastinum, they can sometimes present in the neck and have a cystic nature.

9. **Cystic Hygroma**: A variant of lymphangioma, cystic hygromas are usually evident at birth or develop early in life, presenting as painless cystic neck masses.

10. **Metastatic Cystic Lymph Node**: Although typically associated with a known primary tumor, metastasis to cervical lymph nodes can occasionally present as cystic masses.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:
Considering all patient information, test results, and pathological findings, the differential diagnosis can be reranked as follows:

1. **Parathyroid Cyst**: Strongly supported by the positive PTH stain within the cystic lesion and typical presentation.
2. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**: Common congenital cause of a lateral neck mass, fits well with the presentation.
3. **Thyroid Cyst**: The anechoic nature on ultrasound and lesion’s location supports this.
4. **Surgical changes/Ectopic parathyroid**: Although benign, we must consider structural anomalies in the parathyroid positioning.
5. **Lymphangioma**: Reflects the anechoic, cystic nature seen on ultrasound but less supported by PTH staining.
6. **Thyroid Adenoma**: An unlikely choice given the pathology does not support malignancy or solid components.
7. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**: Less likely due to lateral position and lack of midline involvement.
8. **Dermoid Cyst**: Unlikely given typical midline presentation and no reported complex internal structure.
9. **Thymic Cyst**: Fitting description but less common compared to other diagnoses, less support by pathology.
10. **Cystic Hygroma**: Low probability given age of onset and less classic clinical finding for this age and presentation.

### INPUT:
A 23-year-old woman presented with 6 months of intermittent bilateral retro-orbital pain associated with blurred vision and wavy lines in the vision of both eyes, followed by worsening numbness and tingling of her hands and legs. Medical history was notable for mild obesity (body mass index of 30 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]). Visual acuity was 20/20 OU, with briskly reactive pupils OU and no relative afferent pupillary defect. Intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg OU. Ishihara color plates were 13/13 OU. Extraocular movements were full. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed blurring and elevation of the nasal margins of the optic disc consistent with grade 1 optic disc edema in both eyes (Figure). Optical coherence tomography showed an elevated mean peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness of 170 μm OD and 150 μm OS. Automated visual fields demonstrated subtle enlargement of the blind spots.

    ","POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes) syndrome","To formulate a differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, we will consider one hypothesis at each step and then rerank them after reviewing all steps.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis
1. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**
   - Intermittent bilateral retro-orbital pain, blurred vision, and wavy lines can be early signs of optic neuritis, often associated with MS.
   
2. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)**
   - Grade 1 optic disc edema and elevated peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness can indicate IIH, often seen in young, obese women.

3. **Migraine with Aura**
   - Blurred vision and visual disturbances can be associated with a migraine aura, which could explain the intermittent nature of the symptoms.

4. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Sarcoidosis can cause granulomatous uveitis and other ocular manifestations, potentially leading to optic disc edema.

5. **Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)**
   - Similar to MS, NMOSD can present with optic neuritis but tends to cause more severe optic nerve damage.

6. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
   - SLE can cause neurological and ocular manifestations, including optic neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy.

7. **Vitamin B12 Deficiency**
   - B12 deficiency can cause optic neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy, which may explain the visual and sensory symptoms.

8. **Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST)**
   - CVST can present with increased intracranial pressure leading to optic disc edema and visual disturbances.

9. **Diabetic Neuropathy**
   - Given the patient’s obesity, she could be at risk for diabetes, which can cause peripheral neuropathy and occasionally ocular complications.

10. **Graves' Disease**
   - Thyroid eye disease can cause compressive optic neuropathy and sensory changes due to entrapment neuropathy.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis
Considering the patient's symptoms, physical exam findings, and initial eye examination, the differential diagnoses are reranked:

1. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**
   - Most consistent with optic neuritis, numbness, and tingling.
   
2. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)**
   - Optic disc edema and demographic profile (young, obese woman) highly suggestive.

3. **Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)**
   - Similar presentation to MS but requires differentiation due to severity.

4. **Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST)**
   - Optic disc edema and possible raised intracranial pressure.

5. **Vitamin B12 Deficiency**
   - Explains both optic and peripheral neuropathy; B12 levels need checking.

6. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Can mimic MS but less likely without other systemic symptoms.

7. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
   - More likely to present with systemic findings; needs exclusion.

8. **Migraine with Aura**
   - Less likely but visual symptoms and episodic nature considered.

9. **Graves' Disease**
   - Compressive optic neuropathy would need definitive thyroid signs.

10. **Diabetic Neuropathy**
   - Visual symptoms less likely without clear diabetic history or signs.

By following these steps and considering the entirety of her symptoms and examination results, a clearer clinical picture emerges that prioritizes the most probable diagnoses. Further diagnostic tests such as MRI of the brain and spine, lumbar puncture, blood tests, and imaging may be required to refine the diagnosis.","['Hematology', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Ophthalmology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,F

### INPUT:
A man in his 40s with a medical history of factor VII deficiency hemophilia presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. Following admission, he was intubated with prone positioning, and treatment with tocilizumab and dexamethasone was started. He was also found to have Staphylococcus hemolyticus bacteremia, and treatment with cefepime was initiated. Three days after admission, the patient developed erythema and edematous necrotic plaques of the bilateral ears (Figure, A and B). No devices had been used on the ears. The necrosis progressed during the following days, primarily involving the earlobe of the right ear and a large portion of the helix of the left ear. A punch biopsy specimen was performed (Figure, C and D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pressure necrosis,"### 10-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Staphylococcal sepsis**: Given the finding of Staphylococcus hemolyticus bacteremia, it's crucial to consider that the erythema and necrotic plaques could be a severe manifestation of sepsis.
   
2. **Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)**: Considering the patient's hemophilia and current severe systemic infection, DIC could cause cutaneous necrosis.

3. **Purpura fulminans**: This severe coagulopathy can follow severe infections and present with cutaneous necrosis, particularly in patients with underlying coagulation disorders.

4. **Vasculitis**: This can cause necrotic skin lesions and could be secondary to infection or other underlying systemic diseases.

5. **COVID-19-associated thrombotic microangiopathy**: COVID-19 can provoke thrombotic events that might result in cutaneous necrosis due to vascular occlusion.

6. **Cryoglobulinemia**: This immunologic disorder can be triggered by infections and leads to vessel inflammation and necrosis.

7. **Calciphylaxis**: Although more common in patients with renal failure, this diagnosis should be considered in any patient presenting with painful, necrotic skin lesions.

8. **Warfarin-induced skin necrosis**: Though less likely if the patient is not on warfarin, vitamin K antagonists can lead to necrotic cutaneous lesions.

9. **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)**: This condition, associated with heparin therapy, can present with necrotic skin lesions due to thrombosis.

10. **Necrotizing fasciitis**: A rapidly progressing infection that causes necrosis and erythema but typically has a more aggressive course.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Staphylococcal sepsis**: Most likely given the bacteremia with a known pathogen that can cause severe skin and systemic manifestations.
  
2. **Purpura fulminans**: Likely in context of severe infection, underlying coagulopathy, and progression of necrosis.

3. **Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)**: High on the list due to the presence of an underlying bleeding disorder and a triggering systemic infection.

4. **COVID-19-associated thrombotic microangiopathy**: Associated with COVID infection, known to cause thrombotic complications.

5. **Vasculitis**: Important to consider due to the infectious etiology and clinical presentation of necrosis.

6. **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)**: If the patient received heparin, this could explain rapid necrosis due to thrombosis.

7. **Cryoglobulinemia**: Less common but could be secondary to infection and result in similar skin manifestations.

8. **Calciphylaxis**: Less likely in this patient without renal disease but could explain necrotic lesions.

9. **Necrotizing fasciitis**: Would need more aggressive and rapid progression, but should be considered.

10. **Warfarin-induced skin necrosis**: Unlikely unless the patient was on warfarin, which hasn't been mentioned in the history.

### INPUT:
A 24-year-old woman presented with a 3-week history of sudden onset of headache, nausea, and binocular vertical diplopia. She denied any other neurologic symptoms. Her medical history included untreated hyperprolactinemia manifested by galactorrhea and oligomenorrhea. She did not take any medications, smoke, or drink alcohol. On examination, visual acuity was 20/20 in each eye. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. There was minimal limitation in infraduction in the left eye with corresponding left hypertropia (Video), which was worse in left gaze and right head tilt. Ophthalmoscopy findings were normal in each eye. Visual field findings (Humphrey 24-2 algorithm) were normal in each eye as well. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pituitary apoplexy,"Let's proceed step-by-step with a differential diagnosis considering the given information.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Pituitary Adenoma**
   - The patient's history of untreated hyperprolactinemia, galactorrhea, and oligomenorrhea may suggest a pituitary disorder such as a pituitary adenoma, which can present with hormonal imbalances and can potentially cause headaches and visual disturbances if it compresses adjacent structures.

2. **Thyroid Eye Disease (Graves' Orbitopathy)**
   - Considering the isolated ocular involvement with no improvement following initial conservative measures, the patient might have developed mild forms of thyroid eye disease, which can cause diplopia and vertical misalignment.

3. **Myasthenia Gravis**
   - This autoimmune disorder can cause ocular symptoms including diplopia and variable ptosis, without other neurological involvement, fitting the presentation.

4. **Cranial Nerve IV (Trochlear) Palsy**
   - The limitation in infraduction and associated diplopia worsened by head tilt might suggest an isolated cranial nerve IV palsy, often idiopathic or due to minor trauma.

5. **Multiple Sclerosis**
   - Although not typical, early MS can sometimes present with isolated cranial nerve involvement like diplopia due to demyelination along the optic pathways or brainstem.

6. **Migraine with Brainstem Aura**
   - A rare presentation, but given the headache and occular symptoms, a complicated migraine might be considered, especially if it progresses to include transient brainstem symptoms.

7. **Orbital Tumor**
   - A mass within the orbit or in the cavernous sinus region can cause localized symptoms, including diplopia and mild limitation in ocular movements without substantial visual field defects.

8. **Intracranial Hypertension (Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension)**
   - Though fundoscopic findings are normal, early stages of IIH can present with headache and transient visual disturbances.

9. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome**
   - This rare condition causes painful ophthalmoplegia due to nonspecific granulomatous inflammation in the cavernous sinus or superior orbital fissure, potentially explaining isolated diplopia and headache.

10. **Primary Brain Tumor**
    - A potential underlying neoplasm, such as a glioma, could cause similar symptoms if located in regions affecting vision and cranial nerve pathways, even without overt signs on initial examination.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses Based on All Information:

1. **Pituitary Adenoma** - Strongly indicated by hormonal history and presentations, particularly untreated hyperprolactinemia.
2. **Cranial Nerve IV Palsy** - Fits the isolated ocular findings, particularly the specific diplopia worsened by certain head positions.
3. **Myasthenia Gravis** - Ocular presentation without systemic involvement fits well early in the disease course.
4. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - Given the isolated ocular findings, though less fitting without systemic thyroid dysfunction signs.
5. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome** - Uncommon but fits the presentation of painful ophthalmoplegia localized to a specific cranial nerve.
6. **Orbital Tumor** - Less consistent visual findings but cannot be conclusively ruled out.
7. **Intracranial Hypertension** - Fits the headache and nausea but usually presents with more definitive ocular findings on exam.
8. **Primary Brain Tumor** - Fits the symptom pattern but less likely without further neurological signs or visual field defects.
9. **Migraine with Brainstem Aura** - Considered only if more common causes are excluded, given the specificity of the current symptoms.
10. **Multiple Sclerosis** - Less likely without more systemic neurological symptoms or previous neurological events.

### INPUT:
A 51-year-old woman was referred for evaluation of headache, right-side jaw pain, paresthesia, and trismus. The patient reported that the facial and jaw symptoms had evolved gradually over the past 5 years and that multiple medical therapies had provided only minimal relief of pain. The patient’s medical history included anxiety, depression, emphysema, hyperlipidemia, migraines, and pseudoseizures. She denied prior head trauma and had no pertinent surgical history. On physical examination, the patient had normal body habitus and reported bilateral tenderness of the temporomandibular joints and paresthesia of the right trigeminal nerve in the V2 and V3 distribution with intact masseteric nerve and symmetric facial nerve. Audiometric evaluation showed normal hearing bilaterally. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a cystic mass in the right side of infratemporal fossa (ITF) that was nonenhancing on T1 sequencing with contrast and hyperintense on T2 (Figure 1A). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Encephalocele,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN)**
   - TN can present with severe facial pain in the V2 and V3 distribution. Chronic cases can show similar symptoms, although a mass found on MRI suggests another diagnosis.

2. **Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) Disorder**
   - Given the tenderness of the temporomandibular joints and symptoms evolving over 5 years, TMJ disorder is a reasonable consideration.

3. **Cystic Lesion (e.g., Epidermoid Cyst)**
   - The MRI findings of a cystic mass hyperintense on T2 sequences suggest the possibility of a cystic lesion such as an epidermoid cyst.

4. **Schwannoma**
   - Schwannomas can present as cystic masses and commonly involve cranial nerves, potentially explaining the patient's trigeminal nerve involvement.

5. **Mucocele**
   - A mucocele can appear as a cystic mass in MRI with hyperintensity on T2, especially involving areas of sinus and oral cavities.

6. **Meningioma**
   - Although less likely given the cystic nature of the mass, meningiomas can exhibit a variety of radiologic appearances, including occasional cystic changes.

7. **Glomus Tumor**
   - Glomus tumors can present as masses in the head and neck region, though they are usually vascular and enhance with contrast, making this less likely.

8. **Arachnoid Cyst**
   - Arachnoid cysts are cerebrospinal fluid-filled sacs that can be hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI images and could theoretically cause similar symptoms.

9. **Metastatic Disease**
   - Although less specific given the appearance, metastatic lesions should be included in the differential for an unexpected cystic mass.

10. **Cholesteatoma**
   - Despite commonly being located in the temporal bone, cholesteatomas can cause cystic lesions and mimic such presentations on MRI.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

Considering all patient information, patient's history, symptoms, and MRI findings:

1. **Schwannoma**
   - Given cystic mass at the trigeminal nerve distribution, typical MRI features, and gradually evolving symptoms.

2. **Epidermoid Cyst**
   - Supported by MRI findings and commonality of cystic lesions presenting in this pattern.

3. **Arachnoid Cyst**
   - Cystic mass, commonly hyperintense on T2, fits description though involvement of the trigeminal nerve region would be atypical.

4. **Mucocele**
   - Fits MRI description, but their usual location doesn’t strongly correlate with patient’s specific symptomatology.

5. **TMJ Disorder**
   - Supports some clinical findings, but a cystic mass on MRI is not consistent.

6. **Trigeminal Neuralgia**
   - Symptoms align well, though MRI findings suggest an anatomical cause.

7. **Metastatic Disease**
   - Important differential but less favored without primary malignancy history or more indicative features.

8. **Meningioma**
   - Meningiomas less commonly present with these MRI characteristics but are still a consideration.

9. **Cholesteatoma**
   - Unusual location for cholesteatoma but should be considered due to its cystic nature.

10. **Glomus Tumor**
    - Vascular nature usually contradicts non-enhancing MRI findings.","['Neurology', 'Neurosurgery', 'Otolaryngology', 'Skull Base', 'Head and Neck Surgery']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,51.0,F

### INPUT:
A 12-year-old girl with an unremarkable medical and ocular history was admitted for workup of anemia (hemoglobin, 6.7 g/dL; to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) and leukopenia (white blood cell count, 1220 cells/μL; to convert to ×109 cells per liter, multiply by 0.001) with associated symptoms of headache, malaise, recent cough, and fever. Inflammatory markers were elevated with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 130 mm/h and a C-reactive protein level of 1.48 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10). The patient noted floaters in her right eye, which prompted an ophthalmology consultation. On bedside examination, her near visual acuity was J1+ (Snellen equivalent, 20/20 OU), and color vision was full in both eyes; the patient’s intraocular pressure, pupils, extraocular movements, and confrontational visual fields were all unremarkable. Dilated examination revealed grade I and II optic disc edema in the right and left eyes, respectively, and peripapillary hemorrhage in the right eye. Optical coherence tomography was obtained 3 days after initial consultation, which confirmed bilateral disc edema, more pronounced in the left eye than the right eye (Figure 1), and 24-2 Humphrey visual field examination in both eyes was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without contrast and lumbar puncture were obtained, and results showed diffuse signal abnormality in the bone marrow compartment and findings suggestive of papilledema. Magnetic resonance venography did not reveal thrombosis. Opening pressure during lumbar puncture was 37 cm H2O (upper limit of normal, 28 cm H2O); all cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral serology test results were negative, and glucose level and red and white blood cell counts were all within normal limits. CSF protein was slightly decreased at 10.4 mg/dL, and CSF cytospin findings were unremarkable. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"Based on the given clinical presentation, let's develop a 10-step differential diagnosis:

1. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)**
   - Given the elevated opening pressure during lumbar puncture and the presence of papilledema.

2. **Leukemia**
   - Due to anemia, leukopenia, and diffuse signal abnormality in the bone marrow.

3. **Aplastic Anemia**
   - Considering the pancytopenia (low hemoglobin and white blood cell count) and bone marrow abnormalities.

4. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
   - Possible due to the presentation of anemia and elevated inflammatory markers, though specific lupus tests would be needed.

5. **Infectious mononucleosis**
   - Cough, fever, and systemic symptoms with atypical bone marrow findings.

6. **Sepsis**
   - Given the fever, malaise, and elevated inflammatory markers, though less likely with normal CSF.

7. **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)**
   - Specific subtype of leukemia that could present with similar hematological abnormalities and bone marrow findings.

8. **Iron Deficiency Anemia**
   - Simple explanation for anemia, though doesn't account for leukopenia and bone marrow.

9. **Viral Encephalitis**
   - Less likely with clean CSF and nonspecific MRI but fever and systemic complaints.

10. **Vasculitis**
    - Consider due to systemic symptoms and elevated ESR/CRP potentially causing secondary bone marrow changes.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis
After considering all patient information and test results comprehensively, the differential diagnoses can be reranked in terms of likelihood:

1. **Leukemia**
   - Notable bone marrow abnormalities, pancytopenia, and systemic symptoms strongly suggest this diagnosis.

2. **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)**
   - Specific type of leukemia that fits with the clinical picture especially hematological parameters.

3. **Aplastic Anemia**
   - Fits anemia, leukopenia, and potentially bone marrow findings.

4. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)**
   - Elevated CSF pressure and papilledema make this a strong possibility.

5. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
   - Multisystem involvement with anemia and elevated inflammatory markers.

6. **Infectious mononucleosis**
   - Presents with systemic symptoms with potential hematological changes, but less likely with current marrow findings.

7. **Sepsis**
   - Systemic inflammation and fever considered but less specific for all findings.

8. **Iron Deficiency Anemia**
   - Explains the anemia but not the complete clinical picture.

9. **Viral Encephalitis**
   - Less probable due to normal CSF and missing specific neurological deficits.

10. **Vasculitis**
    - Possible inflammatory cause but lower on the rank with current specific findings.

### INPUT:
A 64-year-old man presented to the otolaryngology clinic with hoarseness of voice for 3 weeks associated with intermittent dry cough. He had no medical history or family history of cancer and was not a smoker. In the absence of other suggestive symptoms, as well as a normal physical examination that did not reveal any enlarged cervical lymph nodes or oropharyngeal or neck mass and an unremarkable nasoendoscopic examination, a diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux was made. The patient was advised to try conservative management with dietary advice and proton pump inhibitors, and a clinical review was scheduled in 6 weeks. The patient only returned 3 months later when his hoarseness became worse. Repeat nasoendoscopy now showed left vocal cord palsy in the paramedian position. In the absence of a history of trauma and associated neurological or systemic symptoms, the main concern was an underlying tumor that impinged on the vagus nerve at various points or its recurrent branch. Results of a computed tomographic (CT) scan showed an ill-defined soft tissue mass, which was likely nodal disease, at the left supraclavicular (Figure 1), as well as the prevertebral and paravertebral region, which partially encased the left common carotid, left subclavian, and left vertebral arteries. This was along the expected course of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve and likely accounted for the left vocal cord palsy. However, the primary site of disease remained unclear. A fused positron emission tomography with CT (PET/CT) scan with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer was then performed.

9. **Carotid Body Tumor**
10. **Bronchogenic Cyst**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

Given the patient’s presentation with left vocal cord palsy, worsening hoarseness, intermittent dry cough, and CT findings of a soft tissue mass affecting the recurrent laryngeal nerve course, the differential diagnoses should be reranked as follows:

1. **Lung Cancer (Especially Left-Sided)**
   - High suspicion due to the commonality of left recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement and CT findings.
2. **Thyroid Cancer (Mediastinal Extension)**
   - Thyroid involvement is plausible given the anatomical position and extension into mediastinum.
3. **Esophageal Cancer**
   - Potential to invade local structures and present similarly.
4. **Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma**
   - Commonly presents with nodal disease, and the imaging features suggest a nodal process.
5. **Primary Tumor of the Mediastinum**
   - Could cause compressive symptoms and CT findings suggest involvement of the mediastinum.
6. **Laryngeal Cancer**
   - Despite a normal early nasoendoscopic evaluation, vocal cord involvement could still suggest primary laryngeal cancer.
7. **Plasmacytoma (Extramedullary)**
   - Although less common, can present with mass in a similar region and affect neural structures.
8. **Carotid Body Tumor**
   - Rare, but possible given the location relative to the carotid artery and neck.
9. **Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma**
   - Generally metastasizes late, but renal cell carcinoma can have varied metastatic presentations.
10. **Bronchogenic Cyst**
    - Congenital lesion that might present later in life with mass effect symptoms but less likely without prior indications.

### INPUT:
A 32-year-old woman was referred by her dentist to an oral surgeon for evaluation of persistent bilateral cheek swelling and mouth pain. Two months prior to presentation, the patient had awoken with bilateral linear “gashes” in her mandibular vestibule that were accompanied by bilateral buccal facial swellings. Since that day, the facial swelling remained unchanged, and although the mucosal lesions healed, the oral pain persisted. The patient’s medical history was noteworthy for depression, for which she was taking bupropion and fluoxetine, and prior alcohol use disorder, for which she was 3 years sober. She denied any smokeless tobacco use but endorsed daily electronic cigarette use. The extraoral examination detected bilateral buccal facial swelling of the lower facial third without associated trismus or lymphadenopathy (Figure, A). Intraorally, bilateral scarring of the mandibular buccal vestibule was noted with focal areas of ulceration. Small aphthous ulcerations were also present on the right buccal mucosa (Figure, B). An incisional biopsy of the right vestibular lesion was performed, and the specimen showed diffuse plasmalymphocytic infiltrates within the lamina propria. On higher magnification, noncaseating granulomatous inflammation was observed (Figure, C). Staining for acid-fast bacilli was negative. 
### OUTPUT:

3. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's Granulomatosis)**
4. **Oral Lichen Planus**
5. **Sjogren's Syndrome**
6. **Behçet's Disease**
7. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
8. **Primary Syphilis**
9. **Tuberculosis**
10. **Chronic Granulomatous Disease**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis considering all patient information:
1. **Sarcoidosis** - Noncaseating granulomas are typically seen in sarcoidosis, which fits the histopathological findings.
2. **Crohn's Disease** - Oral manifestations of Crohn’s can present with granulomatous inflammation, cheilitis, and aphthous ulcers.
3. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's Granulomatosis)** - This vasculitis disorder can have granulomatous inflammation but typically also involves the respiratory and renal systems.
4. **Behçet's Disease** - Characterized by recurrent oral ulcers and inflammation which can accompany systemic symptoms but is less likely to present with noncaseating granulomas.
5. **Tuberculosis** - Although staining for acid-fast bacilli was negative, tuberculosis can be a differential for granulomatous inflammation.
6. **Oral Lichen Planus** - Chronic inflammatory condition commonly involving the oral mucosa but usually presents without granulomas.
7. **Sjogren's Syndrome** - Typically presents with dry mouth and eyes, might have lymphocytic infiltrates but is less likely to present with persistent cheek swelling and granulomatous inflammation.
8. **Primary Syphilis** - Can present with oral ulcers but noncaseating granulomas are not typical - Syphilis should primarily show spirochetes upon specific staining.
9. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - Autoimmune condition with varied presentations and can cause oral ulcers, but it doesn't typically present with noncaseating granulomas.
10. **Chronic Granulomatous Disease** - A genetic disorder leading to granuloma formation but more common in pediatric patients and often associated with severe infections early in life.

### INPUT:
A 49-year-old African American woman with no significant medical history came to the clinic because of abnormal retinal findings and mildly decreased visual acuity. She was told about these same findings 10 years ago but did not have a repeated eye examination until recently by another retina specialist. She reported no family history of retinal diseases. She initially received anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment, but was later referred because of a concern about either the idiopathic or paraneoplastic variant of acute exudative polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy (AEPVM). Initial workup by her primary care physician was unremarkable for malignancy. Her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/60 OD and 20/50 OS. An anterior segment examination was normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed multiple vitelliform lesions involving the macula and superior macula bilaterally (Figure 1). Fluorescein angiography revealed staining of these lesions with a pseudohypopyon appearance of the central vitelliform lesion in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed hyperreflectance corresponding to the yellow pigment in the vitelliform lesions in the subretinal space. No evidence of a choroidal neovascular membrane was present on examination or imaging. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Best disease,"Let's proceed step-by-step through a differential diagnosis process for this patient, incorporating the detailed ophthalmological findings provided. 

**Step 1:** Best Disease (Best Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy)
**Step 2:** Adult-onset foveomacular vitelliform dystrophy
**Step 3:** Acute exudative polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy (AEPVM)
**Step 4:** Pattern dystrophy
**Step 5:** Sorsby’s fundus dystrophy
**Step 6:** Multifocal vitelliform dystrophy
**Step 7:** Stargardt disease
**Step 8:** Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR)
**Step 9:** Chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (CCSCR)
**Step 10:** Multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis (MCP)

Next, we will rank these differential diagnoses based on the complete patient history, examination findings, and imaging results.

### Re-Ranking Differential Diagnoses:
1. **Acute exudative polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy (AEPVM)**: Judging by the multiple vitelliform lesions, pseudohypopyon appearance, and hyperreflectance on OCT without choroidal neovascular membrane, AEPVM remains a strong contender.
   
2. **Adult-onset foveomacular vitelliform dystrophy**: Considering the prolonged history and similar retinal findings, this could be plausible.

3. **Pattern dystrophy**: The bilateral and relatively symmetrical appearance of the lesions could point towards a less common dystrophy variant.

4. **Best Disease (Best Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy)**: Though typically seen in younger patients, an atypical presentation could be considered.

5. **Multifocal vitelliform dystrophy**: The diffuse and multiple nature of the lesions across the macula could fit this diagnosis.

6. **Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR)**: While typical CSCR might show more defined fluid pockets and not the pseudohypopyon, chronic variants could blur these lines.

7. **Sorsby’s fundus dystrophy**: Less likely due to the specific imaging characteristics and lack of choroidal neovascular membrane but still within the differential.

8. **Stargardt disease**: Given no significant family history and slightly different OCT appearance, it’s relatively lower but still possible.

9. **Chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (CCSCR)**: Again, would typically manifest with different fluid characteristics.

10. **Multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis (MCP)**: Least likely given no signs of inflammation typically expected in MCP.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 8-year-old boy presented to an outpatient clinic for further evaluation of a fluctuating right parotid mass that had been present for 3 years. The patient was not immunocompromised and denied any trauma to the area. In the 2 months prior, he had received multiple rounds of antibiotics from other health care professionals. Outside computed tomography of the face showed a 3-cm cystic structure in the superficial aspect of the right parotid gland with associated lymphadenopathy. An outside health care professional had attempted incision and drainage of the area with negative cultures. The patient presented to our clinic with an isolated right 2-cm fluctuant and tender mass overlying the parotid gland. There was no accompanying cervical lymphadenopathy, and facial nerve function remained fully intact. The patient denied fevers or systemic symptoms. Results of laboratory evaluation revealed normal complete blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels with negative infectious workup results for Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, HIV, and tuberculosis (TB). Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 1.9-cm peripherally enhancing, centrally necrotic lesion overlying the superficial right parotid gland with multiple subcentimeter necrotic lymph nodes within the right parotid gland (Figure 1). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Atypical mycobacterium infection,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps

1. **Benign lymphoepithelial cyst**: Given the cystic structure in the parotid region and the child's generally good health, a benign lymphoepithelial cyst should be initially considered.
  
2. **Chronic sialadenitis**: The fluctuating mass, history of antibiotic treatments, and location in the parotid gland point towards chronic inflammation of the salivary gland.

3. **Branchial cleft cyst**: Cystic neck masses in children often include congenital anomalies such as a branchial cleft cyst.

4. **Parotid gland abscess**: While cultures were negative, an abscess should be considered, as fluctuating tenderness often indicates infection.

5. **Kimura disease**: This rare chronic inflammatory disorder includes parotid swelling and regional lymphadenopathy.

6. **Benign mixed tumor (pleomorphic adenoma)**: Consider this benign neoplasm, which can present as a painless, fluctuant mass in the parotid gland.

7. **Lymphoma**: Lymph node necrosis and multiple subcentimeter necrotic lymph nodes on MRI raise suspicion for a hematologic malignancy.

8. **Warthin's tumor (papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum)**: A benign cystic tumor of the salivary gland with a characteristic cystic appearance.

9. **Sialolithiasis with secondary infection**: Stone formation in the salivary gland ducts leading to recurrent infections and swelling.

10. **Salivary gland cyst (mucocele)**: A cyst arising from the salivary gland duct due to ductal obstruction or rupture.

### Reranking Based on Patient Information and Test Results

After considering all patient history, physical examination findings, imaging results, and laboratory tests, the differential can be refined and prioritized:

1. **Benign lymphoepithelial cyst**: This remains high due to cystic nature and long-standing, non-systemic presentation.
2. **Chronic sialadenitis**: Persistent parotid swelling and normal CBC/ESR support chronic inflammation over infectious etiology.
3. **Branchial cleft cyst**: Less likely given location in parotid and the age of presentation.
4. **Parotid gland abscess**: Decreased likelihood since multiple rounds of antibiotics and incision/drainage were ineffective with negative cultures.
5. **Benign mixed tumor (pleomorphic adenoma)**: This benign tumor should be highly considered; mass consistency and absence of systemic symptoms are suggestive.
6. **Warthin's tumor**: Higher on the list due to cystic nature; more typically occurs in older patients but still a consideration.
7. **Lymphoma**: With negative systemic symptoms and normal lab results, less likely but should remain on the differential.
8. **Kimura disease**: Though rare, the fluctuant nature aligns with this condition, though more common in Asian populations.
9. **Sialolithiasis with secondary infection**: Consistently recurrent and associated infection less supported by absence of systemic symptoms.
10. **Salivary gland cyst (mucocele)**: Considered, but physical examination and radiologic features may not align perfectly.

Final prioritization hinges on further diagnostic workup, possibly including fine-needle aspiration biopsy or excisional biopsy for definitive histological diagnosis.","['Otolaryngology', 'Salivary Gland Disorders', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Pediatrics']",0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his 40s with a 20-year history of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was referred by his primary care physician for evaluation of left ventricular hypertrophy detected by echocardiography. The echocardiogram was performed because of an abnormal electrocardiogram demonstrating sinus tachycardia accompanied by high QRS voltage with a strain pattern in the precordial leads. He had no history of other illnesses. On physical examination, the patient was 154 cm tall and weighed 38 kg. The cardiovascular examination was unremarkable. Neurological examination showed mild cognitive impairment, poor coordination, and muscle weakness of the bilateral lower limbs. Blood test results revealed impaired glucose tolerance, hypothyroidism, and elevated levels of lactic acid (32.4 mg/dL) and pyruvate acid (1.91 mg/dL; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 113.56). Review of the transthoracic echocardiogram showed diffuse hypertrophy, moderately decreased contractility of the left ventricle, and increased intramyocardial signal intensity (Video). The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. On admission, brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated cerebellar atrophy. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated diffuse biventricular hypertrophy and moderately impaired left ventricular systolic function. A wide range of nodular and band-shaped late gadolinium enhancement was detected in the middle and epicardial layers of the left ventricular myocardium. Coronary angiography revealed no significant stenoses of the epicardial coronary arteries.

9. **Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)**
10. **Andersen-Tawil Syndrome**

### Rationale for Reranking

1. **Mitochondrial Myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like Episodes (MELAS):** Considering the elevated lactic and pyruvate acid levels, muscle weakness, hearing loss, and cardiac involvement.
2. **Primary Mitochondrial Disease:** Given the evidence of impaired glucose tolerance, lactic acidosis, and multisystem involvement (neurological and cardiovascular), a primary mitochondrial disorder remains highly probable.
3. **Friedreich's Ataxia:** Neurological symptoms and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are consistent, but the absence of classic gait ataxia and areflexia makes it less likely.
4. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy:** Although this condition explains the heart findings, it doesn't account for the metabolic abnormalities and neuropathy.
5. **Cardiac Amyloidosis:** Can explain diffuse myocardial involvement and hypertrophy, but less likely due to absence of significant systemic amyloidosis symptoms.
6. **Fabry Disease:** This can cause both cardiac and neurological symptoms, but significant renal involvement and skin manifestations are not mentioned.
7. **Pompe Disease:** Glycogen storage disease could explain mild cognitive impairment and cardiomegaly but is less common in adults with such severe involvement.
8. **Noonan Syndrome:** Could explain the short stature and cardiac abnormalities but doesn't fully account for all metabolic findings.
9. **Multiple System Atrophy (MSA):** It’s rare for MSA to present with such a strong cardiac focus, more appropriate if autonomic dysfunction were prominent.
10. **Andersen-Tawil Syndrome:** Includes cardiac, skeletal, and periodic paralysis features, but the metabolic abnormalities and cardiac hypertrophy are less characteristic.","['Radiology', 'Neuroimaging', 'Neurology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Audiology and Hearing']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,40.0,M

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy White man in his 60s presented with right jaw pain, trismus, and facial swelling. Symptoms started a year before, after receiving dental implants for new lower dentures. The patient noted right upper and lower eyelid swelling most notable in the morning but denied associated fevers, chills, vision changes, dysphagia, headaches, urinary symptoms, or rashes. Physical examination revealed a 3-cm round fluctuant area lateral to the right lateral canthus, mildly tender to palpation. No overlying warmth or erythema and no lymphadenopathy. The patient’s dentures appeared to be well fitting, but mouth opening was at approximately 50% of expected. Laboratory results included an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 20 mm/h, and normal complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel results,  and lactate levels. Findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure, A) were most consistent with osteomyelitis of the mandible with inflammation of surrounding soft tissues. Right temporalis muscle biopsy results for Gram stain and culture, fungal stain and culture, and acid-fast bacillus stain were unremarkable. The patient’s symptoms did not improve after 7 weeks of empirical intravenous ertapenem followed by 8 weeks of oral cefuroxime and minocycline. Additional laboratory test results, including serum IgG4, SPEP, brucella AB, Q fever AB, RF, urinalysis, and microalbumin/creatinine levels, were all unremarkable. Results for p-ANCA and c-ANCA were negative. Repeated MRI findings showed progression of the inflammation and new involvement of the temporal lobe dura. Findings on positron emission tomographic computed tomography (PET-CT) scan showed nonspecific inflammatory changes to the bone, muscle, and brain meninges. A biopsy of the temporalis muscle, sphenoid wing, and dura was performed (Figure, B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Atypical vasculitis,"### 10-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Osteomyelitis** - Initial MRI findings suggestive of mandibular osteomyelitis with soft tissue inflammation.
2. **Chronic osteomyelitis** - Given the prolonged course and lack of response to antibiotics.
3. **Atypical infection (e.g., fungal, mycobacterial)** - Due to persistent symptoms despite antibiotic treatment, although fungal and mycobacterial cultures were negative.
4. **Malignancy** - Possibility of a neoplastic process given persistent swelling and bone involvement.
5. **Primary bone cancer (e.g., osteosarcoma)** - Given the bony involvement and progression seen on repeated MRI.
6. **IgG4-related disease** - Considered despite normal serum IgG4 levels.
7. **Sarcoidosis** - Chronic inflammatory disease that can affect multiple organs including bones and muscles.
8. **Langerhans cell histiocytosis** - Rare condition that can affect bones and cause symptoms similar to those described.
9. **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis)** - Given the progressive inflammation and necrosis of tissues, even though ANCA results were negative.
10. **Foreign body reaction** - Reaction to materials used in the dental implants prompting chronic inflammation.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Chronic osteomyelitis** - Persistent after initial diagnosis, lack of response to prolonged antibiotics treatment.
2. **Malignancy** - Due to progressive symptoms, involvement of surrounding soft tissue, and dura.
3. **Primary bone cancer (e.g., osteosarcoma)** - Persistent pain, swelling, and bone involvement.
4. **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis)** - Despite negative ANCA, given the pattern of inflammation demonstrated.
5. **Langerhans cell histiocytosis** - Rare, but fits the progression and chronic inflammation pattern.
6. **Sarcoidosis** - Systemic granulomatous disease that can present in this manner, despite negative ANCA.
7. **Atypical infection (e.g., fungal, mycobacterial)** - Consider re-evaluation as initial cultures were negative.
8. **IgG4-related disease** - Considered unlikely given negative tests, but cannot be excluded completely.
9. **Osteomyelitis** - Initial differential but less likely given chronicity and non-response to treatment.
10. **Foreign body reaction** - Possibility considered due to chronic inflammation possibly related to dental implants.","['Otolaryngology', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Dental Medicine']",0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,60.0,M

### INPUT:
A 13-month-old boy with an unremarkable medical history and no ocular history was brought to the emergency department by his parents for bilateral eyelid ecchymosis and edema for 1 month, as well as a mass on the right temporal area that was persistent for the past month and a half. He had hit the right side of his head on a table 1 month before symptoms developed, but had no other recent trauma. The mass had not changed in size, was not tender, and had no other associated symptoms. His parents had not noticed any change in vision. At bedside, the patient was playful and in no acute distress. On examination, he fixed and followed in each eye. His pupils were equal and reactive to light without afferent pupillary defect. Both eyes were soft to palpation and his extraocular movements were full. Externally, his examination was notable for bilateral upper eyelid ecchymosis and edema, as well as a soft, well-circumscribed mass on the right temporal region (Figure 1). There was no obvious proptosis. He was also noted to have subconjunctival hemorrhage temporally on the right eye. Otherwise, findings of his anterior examination and dilated fundoscopic examination were normal.

4. **Leukemia**: Given its varied presentation in childhood, it could explain the ecchymosis.
5. **Dermoid cyst**: Considering the well-circumscribed, non-tender nature of the mass.
6. **Orbital cellulitis**: Although less likely without signs of infection, it must be considered initially.
7. **Metastatic neuroblastoma**: Metastasis from a primary neuroblastoma elsewhere could present similarly.

### INPUT:
A 59-year-old Asian man with no history of any systemic illness presented with a 1-month history of blurred vision in his right eye. His visual acuity was 20/400 OD and 20/20 OS. The anterior segments were quiet and vitreous was clear in both eyes. Fundus examination in the right eye revealed a solitary, elevated choroidal lesion with a creamy yellow appearance in the macular region involving the optic disc (Figure 1A). Ultrasonography confirmed a dome-shaped choroidal mass with intermediate echodensity measuring 14 mm in diameter and 4 mm in thickness (Figure 1B). Fluorescein angiography demonstrated scattered pinpoint hyperfluorescence of the mass and late leakage of the disc. Indocyanine green angiography revealed hypofluorescence in both early and late phases. Optical coherence tomography disclosed a choroidal mass with undulating surface and shallow subretinal fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit revealed an intraocular mass with hyperintensity on T1-weighted and hypointensity on T2-weighted scans with contrast enhancement extending into the adjacent retrobulbar fat, suspicious for scleral invasion. Blood test results including a complete blood cell count, tuberculosis, syphilis, and angiotensin-converting enzyme were all negative. The patient then developed gingivitis with a white blood cell count up to 12 350/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001) in the next 2 weeks that failed to respond to intravenous antibiotics. There were more pigments overlying the intraocular mass with prominent intraretinal hemorrhage along the optic disc compared with clinical findings at first presentation. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Langerhans cell histiocytosis,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

6. **Posterior Scleritis**
7. **Ocular Toxoplasmosis**
8. **Choroidal Osteoma**
9. **Choroidal Neovascularization**
10. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Choroidal Melanoma**
   - Most consistent with dome-shaped choroidal mass, hyperintensity on MRI T1-weighted, and hypointensity on T2-weighted scans. Elevated choroidal lesion with creamy yellow appearance and subretinal fluid found in this case strongly suggests melanoma.
   
2. **Primary Intraocular Lymphoma**
   - Although less common, the presentation of a solitary choroidal mass and the development of gingivitis with elevated white blood cell count point towards this possibility.
   
3. **Choroidal Metastasis**
   - Similar presentation with localized choroidal mass, but absence of primary malignancy history or systemic symptoms reduces its likelihood.
   
4. **Choroidal Hemangioma**
   - Typically presents as a choroidal mass but lacks the creamy yellow appearance and distinctive imaging features seen in this patient.
   
5. **Posterior Scleritis**
   - Unlikely given the anterior segments are quiet and vitreous is clear; inflammation involves deeper structures without prominent mass typically.
   
6. **Ocular Toxoplasmosis**
   - Rarely presents as a solitary mass with these imaging characteristics, more often associated with retinochoroiditis.
   
7. **Choroidal Osteoma**
   - Usually presents with a more calcified appearance on imaging and is not associated with systemic symptoms like elevated white blood cells.
   
8. **Choroidal Neovascularization**
   - Typically associated with age-related macular degeneration and different fundoscopic and imaging findings; less likely in absence of drusen or neovascular AMD history.
   
9. **Tuberculoma**
   - Negative tuberculosis test makes this diagnosis very unlikely despite some overlapping features.
   
10. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy**
    - Typically presents without such a prominent mass and lesion; characterized by serous retinal detachment rather than subretinal fluid with mass.

### Conclusion:
Based on all the clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings, **Choroidal Melanoma** remains the most probable diagnosis.

### INPUT:
A White man in his 50s with a clinical history of recurrent respiratory infections and diarrhea presented with painful oral erosions that began 2 years before. Results of a previous intestinal biopsy had shown unspecific findings and absence of apoptosis. He reported a 5-kg weight loss that he attributed to impaired intake owing to the oral lesions. He was also being evaluated for a mediastinal mass detected in radiography of the chest performed for pneumonia. Physical examination revealed whitish edematous lacy patches with erosions on the dorsal and lateral aspects of the tongue and buccal mucosa (Figure, A); skin and nails were not involved. A lingual biopsy specimen was obtained for pathologic evaluation and direct immunofluorescence (DIF; Figure, B and C). The result of indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) testing, using monkey esophagus, salt-skin split, and rat bladder as substrates, was negative. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot analysis did not detect any desmoglein-1 or -3, bullous pemphigoid-180 or -230, collagen VII, desmocollin-1 to -3, laminin-332, envoplakin, or periplakin antibodies. Results were normal for liver function; negative for hepatitis B and C; indicative of hypogammaglobulinemia, with a decreased immunoglobulin (Ig) G serum level of 465 mg/dL (normal, 750-1600 g/L; for g/L, multiply by 0.01); and normal for IgA and IgM levels. Positron emission tomography revealed a 10-cm hypercapturing extrapulmonary mass (Figure, D). Surgical excision of the mediastinal mass was performed; its histopathologic features were consistent with a type AB thymoma, Masaoka-Koga stage 2A.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis
Based on the patient's clinical presentation, medical history, test results, and available pathological information:

1. **Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID)** - The hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent infections, and unexplained symptoms strongly suggest CVID.
2. **Thymoma-associated autoimmunity** - The presence of a thymoma along with the immunological symptoms makes this highly likely.
3. **Paraneoplastic Pemphigus** - Although less likely due to the lack of specific antibodies in testing, the presence of thymoma and oral erosions fits this diagnosis.
4. **Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis** - This can present with persistent oral lesions and is sometimes linked to immunodeficiency states like CVID.
5. **Oral Lichen Planus** - Lacy patches with erosions in the oral mucosa are characteristic, although it is usually not associated with systemic symptoms like weight loss.
6. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - While the presentation isn't classic for SLE, it can present with a wide array of symptoms and sometimes overlaps with other autoimmune conditions.
7. **Microscopic Polyangiitis** - Given the systemic nature of the presentation, although there's no clear evidence of renal or pulmonary involvement.
8. **Sjogren's Syndrome** - Although dry mouth and other classic symptoms are absent, it still remains a differential with mucosal involvement.
9. **Pemphigus Vulgaris** - Negative IIF and ELISA testing lowers the likelihood but cannot be ruled out entirely without more conclusive evidence.
10. **Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD)** - Not likely in the absence of a transplant history.","['Allergy and Clinical Immunology', 'Dermatology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology', 'Gastroenterology']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,50.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his 50s presented to our dermatology department with an asymptomatic, arc-shaped, depressed skin groove on the left side of his forehead, frontal scalp, and vertex area. Localized linear hair loss and hair thinning on the left scalp area were observed. The patient reported that when the lesion had begun to appear, approximately 10 years earlier, he had received 2 doses of intralesional steroid via injection on a small bald patch on the vertex. Thereafter, the lesion gradually progressed to the frontal scalp and eventually made a linear furrow on the left side of his forehead. Physical examination revealed 2 long, curved-line, depressed, alopecic patches on the left side of the vertex and frontal scalp area extending to the left eyebrow (Figure, A and B). The lesions measured (length × width) 7 × 2 cm and 6 × 1 cm, respectively. Dermoscopic examination of the alopecic area revealed several short vellus hairs, yellow dots, and honeycomb hyperpigmentation; however, broken hairs were not seen. The result of a hair pull test was negative. The patient denied any trauma history and had no history of connective tissue disease nor any evidence of systemic involvement, such as arthralgia, photosensitivity, or skin rashes. Skin biopsies were performed on the left side of the vertex and the forehead. Histopathologic findings of the 2 biopsy specimens were identical (Figure, C and D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Linear or annular lupus erythematosus panniculitis of the scalp,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Frontal Fibrosing Alopecia (FFA)**
   - The presentation of linear hair loss and vellus hairs could suggest FFA, a primary cicatricial alopecia characterized by progressive recession of the frontal hairline.

2. **Alopecia Areata (AA)**
   - Although the typical presentation is different, alopecia areata can occasionally present with patchy hair loss.

3. **Morphea (Localized Scleroderma)**
   - The linear, depressed grooved appearance and skin changes could be indicative of Morphea, a form of localized scleroderma.

4. **Linear Lichen Planopilaris**
   - Lichen planopilaris is a primary cicatricial alopecia which might present in a linear pattern.

5. **Traction Alopecia**
   - Though typically related to hairstyle practices, it can occasionally present with linear alopecia patterns.

6. **Central Centrifugal Cicatricial Alopecia (CCCA)**
   - Central, slowly progressive scarring alopecia predominantly seen in women of African descent but can also rarely affect other groups.

7. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE)**
   - Presence of scarring alopecia with hyperpigmentation could be due to DLE.

8. **Folliculitis Decalvans**
   - Chronic relapsing condition that can cause patches of hair loss with follicular pustules and erythema.

9. **Nevus Sebaceous**
   - Although congenital, it may not become apparent until later in life and can present as alopecic linear lesion.

10. **Involutional Alopecia**
    - It could be considered in cases of generalized or patterned nonscarring alopecia linked to aging.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses

Given the patient’s history, clinical examination, and dermoscopic findings, the following are the most likely diagnoses, reordered by likelihood:

1. **Morphea (Localized Scleroderma)**
   - The clinical presentation of a linear, arc-shaped, depressed groove with extensions suggests sclerosis of the skin, pointing towards Morphea.

2. **Lichen Planopilaris**
   - The chronic progression and presence of vellus hairs, along with alopecic patches, suggest an inflammatory scarring alopecia likely Lichen Planopilaris.

3. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE)**
   - The presence of yellow dots and honeycomb hyperpigmentation on dermoscopy is consistent with DLE, although systemic signs are absent.

4. **Frontal Fibrosing Alopecia (FFA)**
   - The linear recession pattern closely matches FFA but is less likely given the overall progression and other dermoscopic features.

5. **Nevus Sebaceous**
   - The location and pattern are atypical but nevus sebaceous can show similar features as patient grows older.

6. **Folliculitis Decalvans**
   - Not the most likely given the absence of pustules or infection signs, but still possible in chronic scarring conditions.

7. **Traction Alopecia**
   - Less likely due to the lack of history of hair traction or styling practices.

8. **Central Centrifugal Cicatricial Alopecia (CCCA)**
   - Rare presentation but must be considered especially given the progressive nature.

9. **Alopecia Areata (AA)**
   - The presentation doesn’t exactly fit AA given the lack of exclamation mark hairs and the presence of scarring.

10. **Involutional Alopecia**
    - Least likely as it typically presents with more diffuse hair thinning without scarring or depressed grooves.","['Hair Disorders', 'Connective Tissue Disease of the Skin', 'Dermatology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50.0,M

Findings on pulmonary and neurologic examinations were normal. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 84 mm/h (reference, <10 mm/h), and C-reactive protein level was 9.4 mg/dL (reference, <0.8 mg/dL). A chest radiograph showed prominent reticular markings in the left perihilar area, and chest computed tomography showed a 3.2 × 2.6–cm dense consolidation in the left lower lobe (Figure 1, left panel). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine showed signal abnormality and extensive contrast enhancement within the T6, T7, and T8 vertebral bodies, with sparing of the T6-7 and T7-8 disks (Figure 1, center panel), and a large paraspinal soft tissue mass with spinal cord compression (Figure 1, center and right panel).

5. **Sarcoidosis**
6. **Multiple Myeloma**
7. **Spinal Epidural Abscess**
8. **Lung Cancer**
9. **Brucellosis**
10. **Lymphoma**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Tuberculosis (TB)** - Given the patient's history of travel from India, symptoms, and radiologic findings, TB remains a top differential despite the negative interferon gamma release assay, as latent TB can present later.
2. **Metastatic Cancer** - The vertebral involvement and paraspinal mass suggest possible metastatic disease, common in prostate, lung, and breast cancers.
3. **Lymphoma** - The systemic symptoms along with mass and bone involvement could point towards lymphoma.
4. **Brucellosis** - Given high ESR and CRP, and endemic consideration (imported foods), albeit less likely given lack of direct contact.
5. **Fungal Infection** - Such as Coccidioidomycosis should be considered due to endemic exposure risk.
6. **Bacterial Abscess** - The spinal and lung findings might be secondary to a primary abscess, although usually there would be more acute systemic signs.
7. **Lung Cancer** - The lung mass with bone involvement warrants ruling out bronchogenic carcinoma.
8. **Sarcoidosis** - The involvement of multiple organ systems and chronicity is consistent but lacks specific diagnostic findings.
9. **Multiple Myeloma** - The vertebral involvement and patient's age fit the profile, but the presentation is not classic without other systemic findings.
10. **Spinal Epidural Abscess** - Less likely given the chronicity and lack of acute neurological compromise; however, signs of infection and spinal involvement keep it on the list.","['Infectious Diseases', 'Pulmonary Medicine', 'Rheumatology', 'Tuberculosis', 'Radiology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,46.0,M

### INPUT:
An 18-year-old woman with no significant medical history and no history of sexual intercourse presented for evaluation of pharyngitis and tonsillar exudates of 1 week duration. She reported neck swelling and an occasional dry cough but no fevers, chills, trismus, headache, dyspnea, chest pain, abdominal pain, fatigue, or rash. One week prior to presentation, she visited an urgent care clinic for evaluation of pharyngitis and white exudates on her tonsils. Results of a rapid strep test and heterophile antibody test (monospot) were negative. A throat culture was obtained and she was prescribed amoxicillin (500 mg twice daily for 10 days) for possible group A streptococcal infection. Despite taking antibiotics for 7 days, she had no improvement in her symptoms. One day prior to presentation, the urgent care clinic notified the patient that her throat culture results were negative. On presentation, the patient was in no acute distress and had normal vital signs. She had bilateral white tonsillar exudates and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, but no exudate was observed elsewhere in the oral cavity and the uvula was midline (Figure). There was no axillary or inguinal adenopathy and no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Viral Pharyngitis (e.g., Adenovirus)**: Negative rapid strep test, no improvement with antibiotics, typical presentation.
2. **Primary Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Pharyngitis**: Considerable given tonsillar exudates and negative bacterial cultures.
3. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Pharyngitis**: Similar presentation to mononucleosis with negative Monospot test.
4. **Infectious Mononucleosis**: Despite a negative Monospot, false negatives can occur.
5. **Diphtheria**: The presence of tonsillar exudates without improvement on antibiotics can suggest this diagnosis even though it is rare.
6. **Fungal Pharyngitis (e.g., Candida)**: Persistent symptoms unresponsive to antibiotics could indicate a fungal etiology.
7. **Acute HIV Infection**: Consider in sexually active individuals despite no history of intercourse; rare but possible in other forms of transmission.
8. **Lemierre’s Syndrome**: Persistent pharyngitis with neck swelling, although more systemic symptoms typically present.
9. **Gonococcal Pharyngitis**: Usually requires sexual transmission, less likely given history.
10. **Group A Streptococcal Pharyngitis**: Initially suspected but excluded by negative strep test and culture.

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old woman presented to the oculoplastic surgery clinic with a mass on the lateral canthus of her right eye. The mass had gradually grown over 2 months and was tender to palpation. She denied any vision changes, facial trauma, redness, or discharge from the lesion. She had an unremarkable ocular and medical history. On examination, visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/20 OS. Ocular motility was full and pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. Her examination was notable for a 3-mm subcutaneous, firm, mobile, noncompressible lesion near the lateral canthus of the right eye without overlying erythema, warmth, telangiectasia, or ulceration (Figure 1). The rest of the ophthalmic and orbital examination was normal. 
### OUTPUT:
    ","Granular cell tumor, benign","### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Chalazion** - A common eyelid lesion that presents as a firm, painless, non-movable nodule. Chalazion usually presents on the eyelid margins.

2. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - Typically presents as a firm, raised nodule that may ulcerate. Although rare at the lateral canthus, it should be considered in persistent cases.

3. **Epidermoid Cyst** - A firm, movable, subcutaneous lesion that does not cause vision changes or other symptoms.

4. **Dermoid Cyst** - Common in younger patients, but can also be considered due to its subcutaneous presentation and mobility.

5. **Hordeolum (Stye)** - An acute, tender, red lump on the eyelid often caused by infection of sebaceous glands. Its acute onset contrasts with the chronicity of the patient’s symptoms.

6. **Sebaceous Gland Carcinoma** - Rare, aggressive tumor presenting as a firm lesion around the eyelids. Presents more frequently with other symptoms like vision loss or pain.

7. **Lacrimal Gland Tumor** - Rarely presents as a mass near the lateral canthus and usually associated with other symptoms like diplopia, proptosis.

8. **Meibomian Gland Carcinoma** - Rare malignant tumor that often presents as a eyelid mass and can be mistaken for more benign lesions.

9. **Lymphoma** - Can present as a painless, firm mass around the eyes. Usually larger and more progressive than the patient's described mass.

10. **Nevus (Mole)** - Could present as a firm, mobile lesion on the eyelid but typically has other distinguishing features such as color change.

### Reranking Based on Patient Information and Examination:

1. **Epidermoid Cyst** - Given the patient's description of a subcutaneous, firm, mobile, and noncompressible lesion without other alarming signs, an epidermoid cyst is highly plausible.

2. **Dermoid Cyst** - The lesion's characteristics align well with a dermoid cyst, which often presents in this manner.

3. **Chalazion** - While common, its typical presentation on the eyelid margins and being a less mobile lesion makes this less likely.

4. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - Though possible due to its persistence and firm nature, the absence of typical features like ulceration reduces its likelihood.

5. **Sebaceous Gland Carcinoma** - Though a consideration, the lack of other symptoms and signs makes this less likely.

6. **Hordeolum (Stye)** - Unlikely given the chronic nature and the lack of erythema and acute symptoms.

7. **Nevus (Mole)** - Less likely given the mass is firm and mobile without mention of pigmentation changes.

8. **Lymphoma** - Unlikely due to the isolated nature and relatively small size of the lesion without systemic symptoms.

9. **Meibomian Gland Carcinoma** - Less likely due to the absence of significant overlying skin changes or other concerning signs.

10. **Lacrimal Gland Tumor** - Very unlikely given the normal orbital examination and no associated symptoms like proptosis or diplopia.","['Pathology and Laboratory Medicine', 'External Eye Disease', 'Ophthalmology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,44.0,F

### INPUT:
A 48-year-old woman with diet-controlled diabetes presented with a 6-month history of arthralgias in her hands, feet, elbows, and knees; 3 weeks of a purpuric rash and foot paresthesias; and 2 weeks of bilateral eye pain and redness. She had been prescribed 4 days of prednisone (10 mg/d) without improvement. She had no fevers, epistaxis, rhinorrhea, cough, shortness of breath, or hematuria. She had no history of recent travel or illicit drug use and was not taking any medications. On examination, her vital signs were normal. She had bilateral scleral injection and swelling and tenderness over the proximal interphalangeal joints bilaterally. Hemorrhagic vesicles and violaceous papules were present on her ears, nose, arms, and legs (Figure). Laboratory studies revealed normal complete blood cell count, serum electrolyte levels, and liver enzyme levels. Urinalysis findings were normal and urine toxicology screen was negative. Punch biopsy of a papule on the right arm demonstrated a superficial perivascular infiltrate of neutrophils with leukocytoclasia, extravasation of erythrocytes, and fibrin in small blood vessel walls. Direct immunofluorescence testing was negative for in situ deposits of IgG, IgA, IgM, and C3. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",ANCA-associated vasculitis,"1. **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA)**: Considering the combination of arthralgias, purpuric rash, and bilateral eye involvement, along with the biopsy results indicating leukocytoclastic vasculitis, GPA should be considered.

2. **Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA)**: Another small vessel vasculitis that can present similarly with systemic involvement, often necessitating consideration in differential diagnosis of vasculitic syndromes.

3. **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)**: Although RA typically does not present with a purpuric rash, patients can develop secondary Sjögren syndrome, ocular involvement, and vasculitic phenomena.

4. **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: Given the broad range of manifestations including arthralgias, rashes, and potential vascular involvement, SLE is a strong contender.

5. **Cryoglobulinemia**: Presentation of purpura, arthralgias, and the immune complex-mediated vasculitis can align with this diagnosis.

6. **Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP)**: While often seen in children, adults can present similarly with palpable purpura, arthralgias, and gastrointestinal involvement.

7. **Erythema nodosum**: Less likely due to the specific presentation but still relevant due to the presence of painful, erythematous lesions, possibly secondary to an underlying systemic condition.

8. **Behçet's disease**: Requires consideration due to the combination of ocular involvement, skin lesions, and systemic manifestations like arthralgias.

9. **Infective endocarditis**: While not classic, subacute bacterial endocarditis can present with immune complex-mediated vasculitis and multisystem involvement.

10. **Sarcoidosis**: The presence of sarcoid uveitis and systemic manifestations can fit, though the skin biopsy would likely show non-caseating granulomas.

---

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA)**: Most likely given the systemic vasculitic features, biopsy findings, and eye involvement.
  
2. **Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA)**: Close contender due to overlapping clinical presentation with GPA and systemic vasculitis.

3. **Behçet's disease**: Notable for the triad of oral ulcers, genital ulcers, and uveitis, the eye involvement is key here.

4. **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: Multisystem involvement is characteristic, though the lack of certain classic symptoms (e.g., malar rash, renal involvement) makes it slightly less probable than GPA or MPA.

5. **Cryoglobulinemia**: Fits the systemic vasculitis and immune complex phenomenon but slightly less typical ocular presentation.

6. **Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP)**: Considerable for its palpable purpura and systemic involvement, though typically more common among pediatric cases.

7. **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)**: The presence of arthralgias and potential secondary vasculitic components put it in the differential, though primary vasculitis is less common.

8. **Infective endocarditis**: An important consideration due to potential vasculitic phenomena and multisystem involvement, but less likely without suggestive history or systemic symptoms (e.g., fevers).

9. **Sarcoidosis**: Could present with systemic symptoms, uveitis, and skin involvement but the biopsy findings do not align well with non-caseating granulomas typical of sarcoidosis.

10. **Erythema nodosum**: Less likely given the specific presentation of symptoms and lack of the classic nodule patterns and systemic symptoms aligning with a potential underlying systemic disease.","['Dermatology', 'Rheumatology', 'Connective Tissue Disease of the Skin', 'Ophthalmology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,48.0,F

### INPUT:
A 65-year-old woman with locally advanced, unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma being treated with pemigatinib, a fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor (FGFRi), presented with a painful eruption on the bilateral lower extremities. Pemigatinib treatment was initiated 2 months prior to the skin findings. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated a mildly elevated D-dimer level at 578 ng/mL fibrinogen-equivalent units, prolonged prothrombin time of 12.7 seconds, elevated phosphorus level at 6.8 mg/dL (of note, phosphorus was 3.1 mg/dL 1 month prior), and normal calcium level and kidney function. Other laboratory tests to note include cryoglobulin and cryofibrinogen, which both had negative results. Within weeks, there was rapid progression with skin necrosis despite treatment initiation with rivaroxaban. Physical examination revealed retiform purpura with areas of necrosis involving the bilateral lower extremities (Figure, A and B). A punch biopsy specimen from the right calf was obtained for histopathologic analysis (Figure, C and D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Calciphylaxis,"1. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**: Considered due to the patient's presentation with painful skin lesions.
2. **Warfarin-Induced Skin Necrosis**: Relevant given the patient's anticoagulation regimen, though less likely without warfarin use.
3. **Calciphylaxis**: Suggested by the combination of necrotic skin lesions, elevated phosphorus, and underlying malignancy.
4. **Cryoglobulinemia**: Ruled out given negative cryoglobulin test.
5. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**: Possible due to painful, necrotic skin lesions, especially in the context of an underlying disease.
6. **Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT)**: Considered due to its thrombotic and skin necrosis features though the patient is on rivaroxaban.
7. **Thrombotic Vasculopathy**: Given the elevated D-dimer and prothrombin time, and the necrotic presentation.
8. **Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis**: Indicated by retiform purpura and could be triggered by medication or malignancy.
9. **Necrotizing Fasciitis**: Ruled out due to the absence of systemic signs of severe infection.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Panic Attack/Anxiety Disorder**
   - Reasoning: Young patient, presenting symptoms can be associated with anxiety. Normal cardiopulmonary exam, blood tests, and absence of significant ECG or echocardiogram findings support this.
   
2. **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)**
   - Reasoning: Palpitations are a hallmark, but absence of characteristic ECG changes lessens likelihood slightly compared to anxiety.

3. **Hyperthyroidism**
   - Reasoning: Can cause palpitations and anxiety-like symptoms, but thyroid function tests are typically used to confirm this, and these tests were not reported as abnormal.

4. **Mitral Valve Prolapse**
   - Reasoning: Often discovered incidentally in young adults; echocardiogram can help but findings were reported normal.

5. **Myocarditis**
   - Reasoning: Can present with chest pain and normal initial cardiac workup. However, usually has elevated inflammatory markers which were not reported.

6. **Atrial Fibrillation**
   - Reasoning: Given the anxiety and absence of clear AFib on ECG or symptoms, it's less likely but still possible.

7. **Pericarditis**
   - Reasoning: Characteristic ECG findings (e.g., diffuse ST elevation) are typically present which are absent here.

8. **Pulmonary Embolism**
   - Reasoning: Shortness of breath and chest pain are symptoms, but normal oxygen saturation and lack of risk factors make this less likely.

9. **Pneumothorax**
   - Reasoning: Chest pain and shortness of breath are key symptoms, though typically there’d be significant findings on physical exam or imaging not noted here.

10. **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)**
    - Reasoning: Extremely unlikely in a young patient without risk factors and with a normal cardiac workup.

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old woman presented to the otolaryngology clinic with a 6-month history of a right neck mass with compressive symptoms. She first noticed swelling that progressed to pressure and dyspnea while supine. She reported fatigue but denied pain, voice change, weight loss, hemoptysis, and dysphagia. A physical examination revealed a visible and palpable fullness to the right neck without overlying cutaneous or sinus tract changes. Results of a complete blood cell count, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, triiodothyronine and levorotatory thyroxine testing, and a complete metabolic panel were normal. Ultrasonography showed a 7.9 × 6.3-cm septate cystic mass lateral to the right thyroid gland. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the neck demonstrated a large, nonenhancing cystic-appearing lesion abutting the lateral and posterior margins of the right thyroid lobe and extending from the level of the piriform sinus to the thoracic inlet (Figure). Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration revealed clear fluid with a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 67 pg/mL (reference range, <100 pg/mL; to convert to ng/L multiply by 1.00). A barium swallow study showed no communication between the cyst and the piriform sinus. Excision in the operating room was performed, and right thyroid lobectomy was necessary because of the intimate association of the lesion to the thyroid lobe. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Parathyroid cyst,"Given the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings, we'll create a 10-step differential diagnosis and then provide a final diagnosis based on available patient information and test results. Each step will consider one differential diagnosis.

### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**: Cysts located near the thyroid can present similarly.
2. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**: Often presents as a lateral neck mass, typically congenital.
3. **Parathyroid Cyst**: Given the association with the thyroid and the PTH level in the aspirate.
4. **Thyroid Cyst**: Common in the thyroid gland and can compress nearby structures.
5. **Lymphangioma**: Cystic lymphatic lesion that can occur in the neck.
6. **Thymic Cyst**: Rare but can occur in the neck, adjunct to the thyroid.
7. **Nerve Sheath Tumor (Schwannoma)**: Typically appears as a mass in the neck.
8. **Cystic Metastasis**: From a primary head and neck or other cancers.
9. **Dermoid Cyst**: A developmental cyst that can appear in the neck.
10. **Lipoma**: Though predominantly fatty, it can appear cystic.

### Final Diagnosis Ranking:

Reevaluating the patient data with confirmatory diagnostic tests:

1. **Parathyroid Cyst**: Highly likely given the clear fluid aspirate with detectable PTH level.
2. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**: Common in presenting as a lateral neck mass; however, the PTH level directs against it.
3. **Thyroid Cyst**: Close association with thyroid lobe; however, the PTH level further suggests a parathyroid origin.
4. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**: Generally median, not lateral, in location.
5. **Lymphangioma**: Fits the cystic feature but less likely to match the clear fluid with PTH.
6. **Thymic Cyst**: Anatomically plausible but less common.
7. **Nerve Sheath Tumor (Schwannoma)**: Possible, given neck mass, but typically not cystic.
8. **Cystic Metastasis**: Given no signs of malignancy, low priority but must rule out.
9. **Dermoid Cyst**: Unlikely with no cutaneous tracts or sinus characteristics.
10. **Lipoma**: Least likely due to physical and aspirate findings.

### Most Probable Final Diagnosis:

A 50-year-old woman presented with a 2-month history of a neck mass that was associated with hoarseness of voice and globus sensation. Physical examination showed thyromegaly (right greater than left) with an approximately 5-cm palpable nodule in the right lobe. There was no tenderness or cervical lymphadenopathy. There was no prior radiation exposure to the head and neck area. Thyroid function test results were normal, and she did not take thyroid medications. A relative had received a diagnosis of papillary thyroid cancer at age 50 years. There was no other pertinent family history, including a history of multiple endocrine neoplasia. Ultrasonography results showed a multinodular goiter with a dominant 4.6-cm right thyroid nodule, 1.6-cm left-sided thyroid nodule, and suspect left level IV lymph node. Ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy results showed papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) (Bethesda VI) with a BRAFV600E variation in the left nodule and lymph node, and atypia of undetermined significance (Bethesda III) with a suspicious Afirma genomic sequence classifier in the right nodule. She underwent total thyroidectomy with modified left lateral neck dissection. Gross examination of the specimen showed a 2.9-cm pale-tan, partially circumscribed, soft nodule in the right thyroid lobe; a 1.4-cm pale-tan, fibrotic, centrally brown nodule in the left lobe; and a 1.8-cm pale-tan, rubbery, partially circumscribed nodule in the isthmus.

## Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results:
Considering the histologic findings, BRAFV600E mutation, FNA biopsy results (Bethesda VI for PTC and atypia for another nodule), thyromegaly, and family history:

1. **Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (PTC)** - Histologic findings (Bethesda VI), BRAFV600E mutation, family history strongly support this diagnosis.
2. **Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma** - Considered due to the presence of thyroid nodules, but less likely given confirmed PTC.
3. **Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma** - Relevant due to thyroid nodule but less likely without typical familial syndromes or calcitonin elevation.
4. **Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma** - Aggressive variant; considered but less likely given the histologic differentiation indicating PTC.
5. **Thyroid Lymphoma** - Considered given the presentation of a rapidly growing thyroid mass, but less likely with histologic finding indicative of PTC.
6. **Benign Thyroid Nodule** - Most thyroid nodules are benign, though less likely given malignancy confirmed in one nodule.
7. **Hashimoto's Thyroiditis** - Can present with thyromegaly and thyroid nodules, but the FNA results make this less likely.
8. **Subacute Thyroiditis** - May present with thyroid pain and dysfunction, but less likely without symptoms of pain or inflammation.
9. **Graves’ Disease** - Thyromegaly and thyroid nodules can be seen, but clinical picture and lack of hyperthyroid symptoms are less supportive.
10. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst** - Less likely given the location, size, and biopsy findings indicative of carcinoma.

### INPUT:
A 33-year-old woman with a history of hereditary bilateral retinoblastoma as an infant presented to a primary care clinic with 1 week of right lower extremity swelling. At age 8 months, she was treated with right enucleation and left eye radiotherapy (50.4 Gy). At age 4 years, she developed a recurrence of the retinoblastoma in the nasal cavity and was treated with 4 cycles of vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide followed by 1 cycle of cisplatin, etoposide, and intrathecal cytarabine. Primary care evaluation was prompted by her mother, as the patient had not noticed her lower extremity edema. She had no fevers, weight loss, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, or history of deep vein thrombosis. Her physical examination was notable for firm, nonpitting edema to the hip. She did not have any associated tenderness, inguinal lymphadenopathy, or palpable abdominal masses. Her vital signs were within normal limits and she ambulated comfortably. Laboratory work results, including a complete blood cell count with a differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, and D-dimer levels, were within normal limits. Doppler ultrasonography of her right lower extremity showed no deep vein thrombosis. A computed tomography venogram demonstrated a 4.0 × 3.5 cm mass of likely vascular origin that was extending into the right common iliac vein (Figure). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Leiomyosarcoma,"### Initial Differential Diagnoses (Step-by-Step)

1. **Lymphedema** - Given the firm, non-pitting nature of the edema.
2. **Soft tissue sarcoma** - Considering the history of malignancy and a new mass.
3. **Lipoma** - Benign fatty masses can present similarly and are common.
4. **Lymphoma** - A vascular-origin mass could be related to lymphoproliferative disorders.
5. **Hemangioma** - A vascular mass suggests this benign tumor of blood vessels.
6. **Deep vein thrombosis** - Initially ruled out by ultrasound but still consider for differential completeness.
7. **Metastasis** - History of retinoblastoma could lead to metastasis in the context of new mass.
8. **Lymphatic malformations** - These could present with swelling and a mass effect.
9. **Post-thrombotic syndrome** - Could be a complication from unnoticed previous DVT.
10. **Benign vascular tumor** - Other benign causes like a vascular malformation.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses

1. **Soft tissue sarcoma** - Most concerning due to history and imaging findings of a mass.
2. **Metastasis** - Given her history of retinoblastoma and potential for late recurrence.
3. **Lymphoma** - The mass effect and location align with lymphadenopathy regions.
4. **Lymphatic malformations** - Likely given the nature and history surrounding her radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
5. **Lymphedema** - Contextually plausible due to non-pitting edema.
6. **Benign vascular tumor** - Correlates with the vascular origin of the mass.
7. **Hemangioma** - Correlates with vascular nature but less common in this clinical picture.
8. **Post-thrombotic syndrome** - Consider for completeness though less likely without prior DVT evidence.
9. **Lipoma** - Given imaging showing a likely vascular origin, it ranks lower.
10. **Deep vein thrombosis** - Ruled out initially by Doppler ultrasound.

A woman in her 70s presented with a 3-month history of episodic fever and painless cutaneous lesions on her lower limbs. The patient otherwise felt well and denied malaise, weight loss, or any other symptoms. She did not have any known benign inflammatory conditions. Physical examination showed indurated plaques with multiple telangiectasias (Figure, A and B) on almost all the surface of the legs. Except for slightly elevated C-reactive protein levels, the results of other routine blood and urine tests were unremarkable. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathology examination (Figure, C and D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma,"Sure, let's proceed through a 10-step differential diagnosis process based on the given patient information, ensuring not to repeat any hypotheses.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL)** - The indurated plaques with multiple telangiectasias and lack of systemic symptoms such as malaise or weight loss raise suspicion for a cutaneous malignancy.

2. **Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis (LCV)** - Episodic fever and cutaneous lesions could indicate a vasculitic process, despite her normal inflammatory markers save for slightly elevated CRP.

3. **Sarcoidosis** - Chronic indurated skin plaques alongside systemic symptoms like episodic fever could point to a granulomatous disease such as sarcoidosis, even without lung involvement.

4. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum** - Though typically painful, atypical cases presenting without pain and with elevated CRP can be considered.

5. **Reactive Amyloidosis** - Episodic fever and chronic skin changes might occasionally be seen in systemic amyloidosis, despite being less common.

6. **Cryoglobulinemia** - Skin lesions and systemic symptoms such as fever, although not typical without other symptoms such as weakness, can still be considered.

7. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans (DFSP)** - This is a rare cutaneous condition that can present with indurated plaques, though less commonly associated with systemic symptoms.

8. **Erythema Elevatum Diutinum (EED)** - This rare vasculitic disorder could present with indurated plaques and episodic fever.

9. **Chronic Infections (e.g., Cutaneous Tuberculosis)** - Given indurated plaques with chronicity, chronic infections are a secondary consideration.

10. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica** - This rarely presents with systemic symptoms but could manifest as chronic indurated plaques.

### Reranking Based on Patient Information and Test Results

Given the biopsy results and other patient information, the most likely diagnoses are reconsidered:

1. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL)** - The presentation of indurated plaques with telangiectasias and the histopathology are typical.
2. **Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis (LCV)** - Still a strong consideration due to the systemic symptoms and cutaneous manifestation.
3. **Sarcoidosis** - Given systemic symptoms and chronic indurated plaques, it remains on the list.
4. **Cryoglobulinemia** - Episodic fever and related cutaneous features.
5. **Erythema Elevatum Diutinum (EED)** - Persisting indurated plaques can point to this diagnosis.
6. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum** - Uncommon presentation, but chronicity and skin involvement keep it relevant.
7. **Chronic Infections (e.g., Cutaneous Tuberculosis)** - Chronic plaques still warrant consideration of chronic infections.
8. **Reactive Amyloidosis** - Given systemic symptoms and indurated plaques.
9. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans (DFSP)** - Rare but serious cause of chronic indurated plaques.
10. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica** - Lower on the differential due to a lesser fit with systemic symptoms.","['Dermatology', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine', 'Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,70.0,F

### INPUT:
A 54-year-old man presented with a 3-day history of right ptosis and double vision. He was otherwise healthy and did not take any regular medications. Initially, he had horizontal diplopia on the first day that was worse at the end of the day, but this resolved when the right eyelid ptosis became complete. He denied any difficulty with his speech, swallowing, weakness, or sensory changes. He presented to the emergency department, and the emergency department physician reported a normal neurological examination result apart from the right-sided ptosis and limited eye movements. He was referred to ophthalmology and had a visual acuity of 20/20 OU. Both pupils were equal sizes and reactive to light. He was found to only have a complete limitation of elevation of his right eye and a limitation of abduction in his left eye (Figure). He was orthophoric in primary position, and there were no eyelid twitches. Orbicularis oculi strength was reduced on both sides. A dilated fundus examination had normal results bilaterally. An initial neurological examination, including assessments of motor strength in the upper and lower extremities and reflexes and a sensory examination, had normal results. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Ocular myasthenia gravis,"Let's systematically approach this patient's condition step by step, developing a differential diagnosis considering the clinical presentation of ptosis and ophthalmoplegia.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis Process:

1. **Myasthenia Gravis**
   - Ptosis that worsens with fatigue and diplopia shifting with gaze direction are classic features of myasthenia gravis.

2. **Third Nerve Palsy (Oculomotor Nerve Palsy)**
   - Presents with ptosis, limitation of eye movement, and possibly pupil involvement (though pupils are not affected in this case).

3. **Graves' Ophthalmopathy**
   - Can present with restricted eye movements and ptosis, though usually accompanied by thyroid dysfunction signs.

4. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)**
   - Progressive limitation of eye movements and ptosis without diplopia initially.

5. **Botulism**
   - Acute onset of ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, often associated with other systemic symptoms like dysphagia and muscle weakness which are absent in this case.

6. **Intracranial Aneurysm**
   - Can present with sudden onset of third nerve palsy, but typically painful and acute. Pupillary involvement is common.

7. **Horner's Syndrome**
   - Presents with ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis; eye movement is usually not affected.

8. **Miller-Fisher Syndrome**
   - A variant of Guillain-Barré Syndrome, presents with ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. Ptosis is less common.

9. **Thyroid Eye Disease**
   - Associated with hyperthyroidism, can cause proptosis, restrictive ophthalmopathy, and ptosis.

10. **Wernicke Encephalopathy**
    - Characterized by ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and confusion, often with a history of alcohol use disorder.

### Reranking Differential Diagnosis Considering All Patient Information:

Given all the information, we have a 54-year-old man with ptosis, diplopia resolving with ptosis, partial ophthalmoplegia, normal neuro exam except for reduced orbicularis oculi strength, normal pupils, and no systemic involvement.

1. **Myasthenia Gravis**
   - The fluctuating nature of symptoms and worsening with fatigue along with focal muscle weakness points strongly towards myasthenia gravis.

2. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)**
   - Given the absence of systemic symptoms and progressive nature of ophthalmoplegia, CPEO is a strong candidate.

3. **Third Nerve Palsy (Oculomotor Nerve Palsy)**
   - While the presentation fits, the lack of pupil involvement and resolving diplopia with ptosis being atypical suggests it's less likely.

4. **Botulism**
   - Acute presentation and isolated ptosis without systemic involvement reduce its likelihood.

5. **Graves' Ophthalmopathy**
   - Absence of systemic thyroid signs makes this less probable.

6. **Thyroid Eye Disease**
   - Unlikely without related thyroid dysfunction.

7. **Miller-Fisher Syndrome**
   - No areflexia or ataxia, making it less likely.

8. **Intracranial Aneurysm**
   - Absence of pain and pupil involvement usually seen in these cases reduces likelihood.

9. **Horner's Syndrome**
   - Difference in clinical presentation, especially due to eye movement involvement, reduces its probability.

10. **Wernicke Encephalopathy**
    - Lack of systemic symptoms and typical clinical triad greatly reduces its likelihood.

### Conclusion:
The prime considerations after reranking are **Myasthenia Gravis** and **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)**. Further diagnostic testing, such as antibody testing for myasthenia gravis or genetic testing for mitochondrial disorders, could help confirm the diagnosis.","['Myasthenia Gravis', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Ophthalmology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,54.0,M

### INPUT:
An 80-year-old woman presented with a 1-year history of right pulsatile tinnitus and aural fullness. Her symptoms were more prominent at night and in the quiet and improved when upright. Physical examination demonstrated an intact tympanic membrane with no middle ear mass; there was no neck mass palpated or bruit auscultated. The patient had further workup with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a computed tomographic scan (Figure 1). The patient was taken to the operating room for a right transtemporal biopsy. Operative findings demonstrated extensive tumor extending along the posterior fossa dura and deep to the jugular foramen that filled the area of the skull base. The tumor was debulked and sent for pathologic evaluation. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Plasmacytoma,"Let's proceed with a 10-step differential diagnosis process based on the given patient information and subsequent reassessment.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Glomus Jugulare Tumor (Paraganglioma)**
   - This tumor commonly presents with pulsatile tinnitus and may extend to the skull base.

2. **Meningioma**
   - Meningiomas are often found in the posterior fossa dura and can cause symptoms similar to those described.

3. **Schwannoma**
   - Especially a schwannoma of the cranial nerves in the posterior fossa, can present with similar findings.

4. **Metastatic Carcinoma**
   - A secondary malignancy that has metastasized to the skull base could explain the extensive tumor involvement.

5. **Temporal Bone Cholesteatoma**
   - Cholesteatoma in the temporal bone can also present with tinnitus and fullness, but the imaging and intraoperative findings are crucial.

6. **Hemangiopericytoma**
   - These vascular tumors can occur in the dura and may mimic the symptoms presented.

7. **Jugular Foramen Syndrome (Vernet's syndrome)**
   - Although typically associated with a syndrome, specific tumors or masses in this area could explain the symptoms.

8. **Epidermoid Cyst**
   - Such cysts can occur in the skull base and present similarly.

9. **Chordoma**
   - Tumors that arise along the clivus and can invade dura and posterior fossa structures.

10. **Chondrosarcoma**
    - A rare cartilaginous tumor that can arise in the skull base and posterior fossa.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on All Information and Results

1. **Glomus Jugulare Tumor (Paraganglioma)**
   - Most consistent with both clinical presentation and extensive tumor involvement around the jugular foramen and posterior fossa dura.

2. **Meningioma**
   - Commonly involves the posterior fossa and the dura but less likely to cause pulsatile tinnitus as a primary symptom.

3. **Schwannoma**
   - Especially those involving cranial nerves in the posterior fossa, could fit the operative findings.

4. **Metastatic Carcinoma**
   - Possibility of a metastasis causing extensive involvement, though primary tumor context is essential.

5. **Hemangiopericytoma**
   - These vascular tumors fit the description but are less common.

6. **Chordoma**
   - Involves posterior fossa and dura but typically presents differently.

7. **Jugular Foramen Syndrome (Vernet's syndrome)**
   - Some specific tumors in this region could explain the findings, though less common.

8. **Epidermoid Cyst**
   - Possible but less common, primary feature would be compressive rather than invasive findings.

9. **Temporal Bone Cholesteatoma**
   - Less likely due to the extension pattern described in the operative findings.

10. **Chondrosarcoma**
    - Least likely due to rarity and typical presentation differing from the current case.","['Otolaryngology', 'Audiology and Hearing', 'Skull Base']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,80.0,F

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy Black woman in her 30s presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of hypopigmented, intermittently pruritic patches. Patches were confined to her face and neck and occurred intermittently after her last pregnancy approximately 10 years ago. She had no history of eczema, atopic skin conditions, or autoimmune conditions and denied family history of such. In previous evaluations, the areas were treated with petroleum-based creams, low- to medium-potency topical steroids, pimecrolimus, and topical antifungals, without consistent improvement. Physical examination identified multiple hypopigmented macules and subtle patches symmetrically distributed across the lower aspect of the forehead, cheeks, nasofacial sulci, and nasolabial folds; and along the jawline and neck (Figure, A and B). Many had a slight overlying scale that was tested with potassium hydroxide and was negative for hyphae. No hair or nail abnormalities were noted. A 4-mm punch biopsy of a hypopigmented patch on the right cheek was performed (Figure, C and D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pemphigus foliaceous,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Post-inflammatory Hypopigmentation**
   - Hypopigmented patches can arise following inflammation or trauma to the skin.

2. **Pityriasis Alba**
   - This benign condition often presents with hypopigmented, slightly scaly patches, commonly seen in children but can persist into adulthood.

3. **Vitiligo**
   - An autoimmune condition causing loss of pigmentation due to destruction of melanocytes.

4. **Tinea Versicolor**
   - A fungal infection that causes hypopigmented or hyperpigmented, scaly patches; usually reveals hyphae on KOH prep, which was negative here.

5. **Lichen Sclerosus**
   - A chronic condition that causes white, shiny patches on the skin, which can become hypopigmented over time.

6. **Sarcoidosis**
   - A systemic condition that can present with various skin manifestations including hypopigmented macules.

7. **Leprosy**
   - While rare, hypopigmented patches without feeling can be an early sign of leprosy.

8. **Secondary Syphilis**
   - Can present with a variety of dermatologic findings, including hypopigmented macules especially in the secondary stage.

9. **Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus**
   - Can present with scaly, hypopigmented, or hyperpigmented patches, often in sun-exposed areas.

10. **Mycosis Fungoides**
    - A type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that can present as hypopigmented patches.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Post-inflammatory Hypopigmentation**
   - Given the history of interval hypopigmentation after her last pregnancy and lack of response to various treatments, post-inflammatory hypopigmentation remains a strong possibility.

2. **Vitiligo**
   - Persistent, symmetrical patches with no hair or nail involvement and no response to various treatments make vitiligo a high consideration.

3. **Pityriasis Alba**
   - Although often seen in children, the described presentation fits well with this benign condition.

4. **Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus**
   - The distribution pattern on sun-exposed areas and the presence of slight scaling necessitate the inclusion of cutaneous lupus.

5. **Mycosis Fungoides**
   - The chronicity and resistance to treatment raise the concern for a more serious condition like cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

6. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Given the symmetrical distribution and hypopigmentation, and the fact that sarcoidosis can present in many ways, it remains a valid differential.

7. **Lichen Sclerosus**
   - Despite being more common in the genital area, its potential skin involvement keeps it on the list.

8. **Tinea Versicolor**
   - Although KOH was negative, its classic presentation keeps it a low but acceptable differential.

9. **Leprosy**
   - Although rare especially in otherwise healthy individuals, persistent and chronic hypopigmentation without other signs might still warrant consideration.

10. **Secondary Syphilis**
    - Less likely due to an absence of systemic symptoms and primary chancre history, but should be considered in atypical cases.",['Dermatology'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30.0,F

### INPUT:
A 71-year-old woman with a history of intermittent generalized pruritus of unclear etiology and right knee osteoarthritis underwent total knee arthroplasty. She presented 8 weeks postoperatively with a 1-week history of scattered pruritic bullae around her incision site. She reported that the symptoms were unlike any rashes she had had before. She had no fever, knee pain, or lower extremity swelling. She was taking no medications and had no allergies. On examination, she was afebrile and well-appearing. Knee examination showed no effusion and normal range of motion without pain. Her incision was fully healed. Several 1- to 2-cm tense, fluid-filled bullae were present around the incision. There was no surrounding erythema or edema. She received topical iodine for 2 weeks, during which time 4 new tense bullae appeared (Figure, left panel). Three bullae subsequently ruptured, while 1 remained intact. Drainage from the ruptured bullae was clear. She was advised to continue using iodine on the affected skin for wound care and was prescribed a 7-day course of oral cephalexin and a tapering regimen of low-dose prednisone. After completion of the antibiotic course, the bullae and pruritus remained unchanged (Figure, right panel). Superficial cultures of the bullae were negative for bacterial growth. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Bullous pemphigoid,"### Differential Diagnosis

1. **Bullous Pemphigoid** - Primary consideration given the presentation of tense bullae and age group.
2. **Pemphigus Vulgaris** - Typically presents with flaccid bullae and mucosal involvement.
3. **Dermatitis Herpetiformis** - Characterized by itchy vesicles and blisters, often associated with celiac disease.
4. **Contact Dermatitis** - Can present with pruritic rashes, but less likely given the negative history of allergies and no new medications.
5. **Infectious Bullous Impetigo** - Unlikely as there was no bacterial growth on cultures.
6. **Fixed Drug Eruption** - Considered due to topical iodine, although the patient has no medication history.
7. **Linear IgA Dermatosis** - Presents similar to Bullous Pemphigoid but differs in immunofluorescence patterns.
8. **Druq Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)** - Typically involves systemic symptoms which are absent here.
9. **Autoimmune Blistering Disease** - General consideration for any autoimmune etiology as bullae aren't resolving with antibiotic treatment.
10. **Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita** - Rare, presents with trauma-induced bullae, and more chronic in nature.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses

1. **Bullous Pemphigoid** - Most consistent with patient's presentation of tense, pruritic bullae, age group, and lack of response to antibiotics.
2. **Linear IgA Dermatosis** - Differential consideration due to similar presentation, requiring immunofluorescence to distinguish.
3. **Pemphigus Vulgaris** - Considered, but less likely given the tense nature of the bullae and no mucosal involvement.
4. **Dermatitis Herpetiformis** - Differentiated by biopsy and immunofluorescence, characterized by intensely pruritic vesicles.
5. **Autoimmune Blistering Disease** - General category, includes multiple primary autoimmune etiologies.
6. **Fixed Drug Eruption** - Unlikely but possible given patient’s exposure to topical iodine.
7. **Contact Dermatitis** - History and lack of new medications or allergies make it unlikely.
8. **Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita** - Less likely due to absence of chronicity and trauma-induced blisters.
9. **Druq Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)** - Unlikely due to absence of systemic symptoms.
10. **Infectious Bullous Impetigo** - Least likely given negative culture and presentation.

To confirm the diagnosis, a direct immunofluorescence test (DIF) of a perilesional biopsy is recommended, with Bullous Pemphigoid being the most likely diagnosis pending those results.","['Dermatology', 'Orthopedics']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,71.0,F

### INPUT:
An 18-month-old girl presented with a 1-year history of a slow-growing mass in the right earlobe. There were no symptoms, such as tenderness or discharge, associated with the mass. She had no history of underlying medical disease or trauma. On physical examination, a 1.5 × 1.0–cm, firm, nodular, angulated, pinkish, nontender mass was observed in the posterior aspect of the right earlobe (Figure, A). The skin over the mass was semitransparent, and the mass moved freely beneath the skin. Under suspicion of a tumorous lesion, complete excision was performed after the patient received general anesthesia. Histopathologic findings were characteristic for 2 cell types; basaloid cells with a nucleus were present in the periphery, and ghost cells without a nucleus were present in the center (Figure, B). Six months after surgery, the wound had healed well, and there has been no recurrence. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pilomatricoma,"Certainly, let's break down the differential diagnosis step by step:

1. **Epidermoid cyst** - Given the location and presentation of the mass as firm and nodular.
2. **Dermoid cyst** - Another common benign lesion in children that can present similarly.
3. **Pilar cyst** - Also known as trichilemmal cysts, which commonly occur on the scalp but can present in other areas.
4. **Hemangioma** - Although typically more common in the first year, some do persist or present later.
5. **Congenital nevus** - A benign mole that could present as a nodular mass.
6. **Branchial cleft cyst** - Possible consideration due to location, but less likely due to lack of typical features and location.
7. **Fibroma** - Benign tumors of fibrous connective tissue can present this way.
8. **Pilomatrixoma (calcifying epithelioma)** - Benign tumor derived from hair follicle matrix cells; presenting feature and histopathology are suggestive.
9. **Keloid** - Arising from a previous piercing or minor trauma, though no history of trauma in this case.
10. **Sebaceous cyst** - A common benign cyst of sebaceous gland origin, typically filled with sebum.

### Reranking the Differential Diagnoses Based on All Information and Test Results:

1. **Pilomatrixoma** - Given the histopathologic findings of basaloid cells and ghost cells, pilomatrixoma is highly suggestive.
2. **Epidermoid cyst** - Initial clinical presentation could align but histopathologic results do not match.
3. **Dermoid cyst** - Clinical presentation could fit, histology is not consistent.
4. **Pilar cyst** - Considered because of its presentation but histologic findings don't fit.
5. **Fibroma** - Persistent nodular mass, though histology suggests otherwise.
6. **Sebaceous cyst** - Fitting with a non-tender nodule but histology is misaligned.
7. **Hemangioma** - Presentation does not fully align with histologic findings and clinical exam.
8. **Branchial cleft cyst** - Clinical presentation and localization doesn’t strongly support it.
9. **Congenital nevus** - Less likely given absence from histopathology.
10. **Keloid** - No history of trauma or wound; histologic findings do not support.

3. **Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma**: Can present as a mass in the nasopharynx with nasal obstruction.

4. **Inverted Papilloma**: A benign tumor that can present with nasal obstruction and a mass.

5. **Sinonasal Hemangioma**: A vascular lesion that might present as a pedunculated mass causing nasal obstruction.

6. **Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyposis**: Could present with nasal obstruction and a mass observed during endoscopy.

7. **Adenoid Hypertrophy**: Common in young individuals and can present with nasal obstruction and a mass in the nasopharynx.

3. **Nasal Polyps**: Common and easily confounded with other pathologies without specific pathologic features observed.

4. **Adenoid Hypertrophy**: Common in young people and aligns with the patient's symptoms but often found in younger patients.

5. **Inverted Papilloma**: Benign but locally aggressive nasal tumors.

6. **Sinonasal Hemangioma**: Vascular lesion presenting similarly but less common compared to JNA.

7. **Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyposis**: Should be considered though the presence of a distinct mass may disfavor this diagnosis.

8. **Schneiderian Papilloma**: Possible but less common, requiring histopathological confirmation.

9. **Nasopharyngeal Cyst**: Less likely but still a differential to consider for mass in nasopharynx.

10. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's)**: Considered last due to other more probable diagnoses fitting the simpler presentation of the case.

At that time, she was found to have persistent sinus mucormycosis, which required multiple rounds of surgical debridement. On this admission, her vital signs were stable, and she was afebrile. Laboratory test results showed a white blood cell count of 0.97 × 109 per liter with absolute neutrophil count of 650 × 106 per liter and platelet level of 17 × 109 per liter. A computed tomography scan showed complete opacification of the left paranasal sinuses (Figure, A). The patient underwent surgical debridement, and a prominent erythematous soft-tissue mass was seen in her left nasal vestibule (Figure, B). The nasal mass was resected for pathologic analysis (Figure, C). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Extramedullary plasmacytoma,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis
1. **Recurrent Sinus Mucormycosis**: Given her history of sinus mucormycosis, the recurrence is possible.
2. **Invasive Fungal Sinusitis (Aspergillosis)**: Another potential invasive fungal infection due to immunocompromised state.
3. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Nasal and sinus masses might indicate malignancy, given her symptoms and mass.
4. **Chronic Sinusitis with Complications (Bacterial Etiology)**: Chronic sinus issues might complicate, though less likely.
5. **Wegener’s Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**: Autoimmune diseases causing nasal and sinus symptoms.
6. **Lymphoma**: Considering her immunosuppressed state and systemic disease history.
7. **Metastatic Disease**: Given her history of multiple myeloma, metastasis should be considered.
8. **Herpes Zoster (Shingles)**: Facial pain and numbness could be due to shingles.
9. **Benign Sinonasal Tumors (e.g., Inverted Papilloma)**: Benign growths that can cause similar symptoms.
10. **Orbital Cellulitis**: Though afebrile, it could cause severe sinus and facial involvement in immunocompromised patients.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis
Based on all information and test results:

1. **Recurrent Sinus Mucormycosis**: History of infection and immunocompromised state.
2. **Invasive Fungal Sinusitis (Aspergillosis)**: High priority due to immunosuppression and neutropenia.
3. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Presents similarly with masses and chronic issues.
4. **Lymphoma**: Immunocompromised and mass presence.
5. **Chronic Sinusitis with Complications (Bacterial Etiology)**: Possible recurrent sinus disease.
6. **Metastatic Disease**: Given her primary diagnosis, metastasis might occur.
7. **Wegener’s Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**: Chronic sinus and facial issues warrant autoimmune consideration.
8. **Benign Sinonasal Tumors (e.g., Inverted Papilloma)**: Common differential but less likely here.
9. **Herpes Zoster (Shingles)**: Unusual due to lack of rash but can’t be ruled out entirely.
10. **Orbital Cellulitis**: Least likely given afebrile status but still a differential in the immunocompromised.

### Final Thoughts
Given the patient's history and presenting symptoms, recurrent sinus mucormycosis is the top differential diagnosis, particularly considering her history of the same condition, immunocompromised state, and notable laboratory findings.","['Myeloma', 'Oncology', 'Hematology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Head and Neck Surgery']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50.0,F

### INPUT:
A 39-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer treated with anti-ERBB2 (formerly HER2) chemotherapy (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) presented to the emergency department with acute onset paralysis. Earlier that day she had upper-back muscle spasms while gardening. A few hours later, she developed weakness of both hands and legs, followed by urinary retention and saddle anesthesia. On arrival to the emergency department, the patient was febrile but hemodynamically stable. On physical examination, she had areflexia and weakness affecting all 4 limbs, with a sensory deficit distal to the T4 dermatome. Proprioception and vibratory sensation were intact throughout. Speech, comprehension, and cranial nerves were intact. Laboratory test results revealed elevated levels of inflammatory markers. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, including white and red blood cell counts, protein and glucose levels, infectious studies, and cytologic testing, was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the total spine showed vertebral body metastases unchanged from a computed tomography scan obtained 8 months prior (Figure 1), multiple areas of new leptomeningeal enhancement around the distal spinal cord, and tumor infiltration of multiple vertebral bodies. An electromyogram showed grossly preserved motor conduction in the upper and lower extremities. F wave latencies (a measure of nerve conduction velocity between the spine and limb) were undetectable in the upper extremities and were normal in the lower extremities, suggesting upper motor neuron disease. Sensory conduction amplitudes of upper and lower extremity peripheral nerves were mildly decreased. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Spinal cord infarct,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)**
   - The patient's areflexia and acute onset paralysis of all four limbs are classic signs of GBS.

2. **Spinal Cord Compression**
   - Given the presence of vertebral body metastases and the sensory deficit below T4, spinal cord compression must be considered.

3. **Transverse Myelitis**
   - Acute onset weakness and sensory changes could be indicative of transverse myelitis, especially with noted CSF inflammatory markers.

4. **Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis**
   - New leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI around the distal spinal cord along with the patient's cancer history strongly suggest this.

5. **Motor Neuron Disease (like ALS)**
   - F wave latency abnormalities and preserved motor conduction could suggest a motor neuron disease.

6. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**
   - The systemic nature of her symptoms with cancer history could point towards a paraneoplastic syndrome.

7. **Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)**
   - The broad neurological involvement might suggest ADEM, though less likely without preceding infection or evidence on MRI.

8. **Metastatic Spinal Cord Tumor**
   - Despite previously unchanged metastases on CT, there's potential for new or progressive metastasis impacting the spinal cord.

9. **Lymphoma**
   - Involvement of multiple vertebral bodies and systemic presentation could suggest a hematological malignancy like a lymphoma involving the spine.

10. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**
    - Typically less acute, but early presentation of MS could present similarly in rare cases and should be part of the differential.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis**
   - Strongly supported by new leptomeningeal enhancement around the distal spinal cord on MRI and metastatic breast cancer.

2. **Spinal Cord Compression**
   - The presence of vertebral body metastases and sensory deficit supports the high probability of spinal cord compression.

3. **Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)**
   - Acute onset areflexic paralysis is very indicative of GBS, although imaging and cancer history slightly lower its ranking.

4. **Transverse Myelitis**
   - Acute sensory and motor deficits with inflammatory markers in the CSF are suggestive, though no direct imaging evidence.

5. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**
   - Multiple neurological involvements and history of cancer, though hard to definitively diagnose without specific paraneoplastic antibodies.

6. **Metastatic Spinal Cord Tumor**
   - Active cancer makes this a potential diagnosis, despite stable prior imaging; new tumor infiltration cannot be ruled out.

7. **Motor Neuron Disease (like ALS)**
   - The F wave latency abnormalities suggest a motor neuron disease component but less likely due to acute onset.

8. **Lymphoma**
   - Considered due to systemic presentation and vertebral involvement, but less likely than other top differentials.

9. **Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)**
   - Has a probable exclusion due to the chronic nature and lack of infectious history or typical MRI findings.

10. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**
    - Unlikely given the lack of progressive or chronic relapsing-remitting history typically characteristic of MS.","['Breast Cancer', 'Neurology', 'Oncology', 'Spinal Cord Disorders', ""Women's Health""]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,39.0,F

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old man presented with progressive unsteadiness, malaise, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting of 1 month’s duration. He had recently experienced acute pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, a tonic-clonic seizure, transient episodes with tetaniform stiffness in both upper limbs, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding caused by gastric angiodysplasia, which was treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and argon electrocoagulation. His medical history included alcohol intake of 2 to 4 drinks daily for several years that had stopped 10 years before admission, hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy, and a stroke 12 years earlier and recovered without sequelae. His medications included omeprazole, furosemide, atorvastatin, allopurinol, metformin, levetiracetam, and acenocoumarol. Physical examination revealed confusion, dysarthria, appendicular dysmetria with truncal ataxia, and downbeat nystagmus. He was well nourished. Results of blood tests showed a mild creatinine increase of 1.62 mg/dL (normal range, 0.4-1.2 mg/dL; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4), serum phosphate levels of 2.4 mg/dL (normal range, 2.5-4.5 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.323), corrected calcium levels of 7.1 mg/dL (normal range, 9.0-10.5 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.25), and serum magnesium levels of 0.3 mg/dL (normal range, 1.8-2.5 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.4114). The results of tests for blood cell count, liver function, and thyroid function were normal, as were levels of sodium; potassium; vitamin B12; folic acid; vitamin E; and antinuclear, antineutrophil cytoplasmic, antigliadin, anti–glutamic acid decarboxylase, and anti-transglutaminase antibodies. Cerebrospinal fluid levels were normal, including proteins, glucose, and cell count; polymerase chain reaction for herpes viruses; and enterovirus. Oligoclonal bands (IgG and IgM) were absent, and IgG index was normal. Onconeural and neuronal membrane antibodies were negative in paired samples of cerebrospinal fluid and serum, and included the following: Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, amphiphysin, Ma2, recoverin, SOX1, titin, Zic4, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65, N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor, contactin-associated protein-like 2, LGT1, γ-aminobutyric acid type B , AMPA1/AMPA2, dipeptidyl-peptidase–like protein 6, and Purkinje cells. Results of whole-body computerized tomography scan and electroencephalogram were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed hyperintensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences without reduced diffusion in the cerebellar nodule (Figure). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Magnesium depletion,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis
1. **Stroke** – Given the history of prior stroke and possible neurological presentation.
2. **Alcoholic Cerebellar Degeneration** – Considering the patient's significant past history of alcohol use.
3. **Wernicke's Encephalopathy** – Symptoms and history of vomits, previous alcohol use, and nutritional deficiency.
4. **Drug-Induced Toxicity** (especially omeprazole or furosemide) – Based on his extensive medication history.
5. **Hypomagnesemia-induced Symptoms** – Critically low magnesium levels observed.
6. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** – Despite negative antibody results, there can still be undetectable paraneoplastic disorders.
7. **Infectious Encephalitis** – There is a broad range of infectious agents that could still be involved.
8. **Metabolic Encephalopathy** – Critical serum electrolyte disturbances can cause severe neurological symptoms.
9. **Cerebellar ataxia due to Multiple System Atrophy** – Without other evident causes, MSA can present with cerebellar ataxia.
10. **Drainage Shunt Dysfunction** – Past cerebrovascular accident and subsequent complications could cause this.

### Re-Evaluated and Ranked Diagnosis
Given the patient's detailed background, test results, and imaging findings, the differential diagnosis can be ranked as follows:

1. **Wernicke's Encephalopathy** – T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity in the cerebellum, history of nutritional deficits, and history supportive.
2. **Hypomagnesemia-induced Symptoms** – Extremely critical low magnesium potentially explaining neurological symptoms and downbeat nystagmus.
3. **Drug-Induced Toxicity** – This includes adverse reactions to omeprazole or furosemide. Electrolyte imbalances like hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia could be related.
4. **Alcoholic Cerebellar Degeneration** – Possible long-term effects of previous alcohol abuse, although less likely given the time since cessation.
5. **Metabolic Encephalopathy** – Electrolyte disturbances including hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia.
6. **Stroke** – The patient’s acute presentation and history of cerebrovascular disease necessitate consideration of a new stroke event despite normal imaging.
7. **Cerebellar ataxia due to Multiple System Atrophy** – Considering a less typical presentation without other specific causes identified.
8. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome** – Rare but possible, especially considering recent bouts of malignancy and negative standard test results.
9. **Infectious Encephalitis** – Less likely due to normal cerebrospinal fluid studies and lack of fever.
10. **Drainage Shunt Dysfunction** – Possible but less likely in this context without more evidence.

### INPUT:
A 5-month-old boy presented to the emergency department with acute oropharyngeal bleeding that self-resolved. Prior to presentation, he had a several-month history of slow feeding and intermittent noisy breathing. Physical examination revealed inspiratory stridor that was worse when supine. Bedside flexible endoscopy findings revealed a fleshy supraglottic mass obscuring a view of the glottis. The patient’s airway was secured in the operating room with an endotracheal tube over a 0° Hopkins rod. The mass was pedunculated on the lingual surface of the epiglottis and had areas of high vascularity and other areas of thrombosis (Figure, A). The vallecula, aryepiglottic folds, arytenoids, glottis, and subglottis were otherwise uninvolved. A biopsy was obtained, and pathology results revealed relatively high proliferation of small, irregular vessels with plump endothelial cells staining positive for glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) (Figure, B and C). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Infantile hemangioma,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Infantile Hemangioma**: Given the high vascularity, mass characteristics, and GLUT1 positivity.
2. **Epiglottitis**: Considering the presenting symptoms of acute oropharyngeal bleeding and noisy breathing.
3. **Laryngeal Papillomatosis**: Based on the mass in the airway, though typically not GLUT1 positive.
4. **Congenital Laryngeal Cyst**: For a mass causing stridor and feeding difficulties.
5. **Laryngomalacia**: Often presents with inspiratory stridor in infants.
6. **Ectopic Thyroid Tissue**: Can present as a mass in the airway with significant vascularity.
7. **Juvenile Angiofibroma**: Considered in vascular masses, though rare in this age group.
8. **Hemangiopericytoma**: A rare vascular tumor that can involve the airway.
9. **Neurofibroma**: Rare, but could present as a fleshy mass in the airway.
10. **Rhinoscleroma**: Unlikely but can present with airway involvement and mass.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Infantile Hemangioma**: Most consistent with mass appearance, GLUT1 positivity, and the patient's age.
2. **Laryngomalacia**: Common cause of stridor in infants, but lacks vascular mass.
3. **Congenital Laryngeal Cyst**: Fits the presentation but is less likely GLUT1 positive.
4. **Laryngeal Papillomatosis**: Mimics mass presentation but usually involves multiple warty lesions.
5. **Epiglottitis**: Can cause similar symptoms but presents acutely with more severe signs.
6. **Ectopic Thyroid Tissue**: Less common but possible for a vascular mass in the airway.
7. **Juvenile Angiofibroma**: Rare in infants and GLUT1 positivity disfavored.
8. **Hemangiopericytoma**: Rare and less probable given GLUT1 positive.
9. **Neurofibroma**: Rare and typically presents later in life.
10. **Rhinoscleroma**: Very unlikely given the demographic and presentation.

By continually assessing the patient’s history, presentation, and biopsy results, infantile hemangioma remains the most appropriate diagnosis, consistent with the histopathological findings and GLUT1 positivity.","['Pediatrics', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Laryngology', 'Otolaryngology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0.4167,M

### INPUT:
A 33-year-old woman was referred for evaluation of intermittent esotropia. When playing video games at a distance or when reading, she developed oscillopsia with eyestrain and noted that her right eye turned up and in. She had undergone strabismus surgery for crossed eyes as a young child and more recently had laser in situ keratomileusis performed. She was medically healthy and neurodevelopmentally normal but had been born 4½ weeks premature. There was no family history of strabismus, and she denied diplopia. On examination, corrected visual acuity was 20/30 − 2 OD and 20/15 OS. Both pupils reacted briskly to light with no afferent pupillary defect. She had 1+ apparent overaction of the right inferior oblique and superior rectus muscles. When she was inattentive, her eyes appeared to be straight (Figure 1). Prism and alternate cover testing during near fixation showed a right esotropia and dissociated vertical divergence when fixing with her preferred left eye (Figure 1, left inset) and a larger left esotropia during forced fixation with her right eye (Figure 1, right inset). She had no cycloplegic refractive error, and retinal examination showed no objective torsion. Placement of +3.00 lenses eliminated her esotropia at near but could not be used to alleviate her symptoms at distance, showing a high accommodation-to-convergence ratio. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Dissociated horizontal deviation,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Convergence Insufficiency**: Given the high accommodation-to-convergence ratio, the patient's symptoms could be related to an issue with convergence.
   
2. **Intermittent Exotropia**: This condition can alternate between different forms of strabismus, causing eyestrain and oscillopsia.

3. **Superior Oblique Palsy**: Prior strabismus surgery and abnormal movements of the right eye vertically may indicate superior oblique muscle involvement.

4. **Fourth Cranial Nerve Palsy**: Overaction of the inferior oblique and superior rectus muscles may point to a palsy of the trochlear nerve.

5. **Latent Nystagmus**: Oscillopsia and eyestrain during specific activities could be associated with nystagmus that is not evident under normal conditions.

6. **Sensory Esotropia**: Reduced vision in the right eye (20/30) compared to the left eye might be suggesting sensory esotropia leading to alignment issues.

7. **Strabismus Decompensation**: Previous strabismus surgery might no longer be effective due to decompensation in the patient's alignment over time.

8. **Accommodative Esotropia**: The correction of esotropia with +3.00 lenses suggests the convergence issue might be related to accommodation.

9. **Dissociated Vertical Deviation (DVD)**: The presence of DVD in examination combination with a history of strabismus indicates it could be a contributing factor.

10. **Skew Deviation**: Oscillopsia and vertical misalignment may suggest a neurological cause, such as skew deviation.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Accommodative Esotropia**: The correction of esotropia with +3.00 lenses at near supports a strong link to accommodation.
   
2. **Strabismus Decompensation**: History of strabismus surgery and current symptomatology indicates probable decompensation.

3. **Dissociated Vertical Deviation (DVD)**: Detected during examination, fits with the symptomatology and history of strabismus.

4. **Convergence Insufficiency**: The high accommodation-to-convergence ratio and difficulty focusing especially at certain distances.

5. **Fourth Cranial Nerve Palsy**: Overaction of the inferior oblique and superior rectus muscles may point to a palsy of the trochlear nerve.

6. **Superior Oblique Palsy**: Abnormal vertical movements and prior surgical intervention involving realignment issues.

7. **Sensory Esotropia**: Given the visual disparity and history suggesting sensory input issues affecting alignment.

8. **Intermittent Exotropia**: Consideration as differential given the intermittent nature of eye turn.

9. **Latent Nystagmus**: Oscillopsia and eyestrain could align with such a diagnosis though less directly indicated (not primary issue).

10. **Skew Deviation**: Least likely due to lack of clear neurological signs, though not entirely ruled out.

### INPUT:
A teenage girl presented with a 1-year history of multiple indurated cords on the anterior neck area. The lesions appeared without an identifiable cause and spread around the neck. The cords eventually covered the entire anterior neck and upper and lower clavicle areas. The skin lesions formed a corrugated pattern at the time of presentation. The patient had previously been treated with moisturizers at a local clinic for 2 months without any signs of improvement. The patient denied any manipulation or trauma at those sites. There was no personal or family history of keloid formation. The girl was otherwise healthy and met normal developmental milestones. On examination of the patient, there were many short, skin-colored, parallel cords on the patient’s anterior neck areas (Figure, A and B). These cords were indurated, slightly raised, and well defined with a shiny surface. The cords had a uniform width of approximately 2 mm, and the lengths varied from 3 mm to 2 cm. During the course of the examination, an ill-defined sclerotic plaque surrounding the underside of the clavicle was found. It had a shiny surface, irregular shape, and measured 10 × 4 cm. No similar lesions were found on any other part of the patient’s body. Inspection of the patient’s skin revealed no abnormal nail fold capillary dilation or hemorrhage; no sclerodactyly, distal digital pitting, or Raynaud disease; and no extracutaneous involvement. A punch biopsy specimen from the affected area was obtained (Figure, C and D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Morphea,"Let's develop a 10-Step differential diagnosis considering the patient's symptoms as well as the physical examination findings and the biopsy result mentioned.

1. **Linear Scleroderma (Morphea)** – Given the appearance of indurated cords and sclerotic plaques, a localized form of scleroderma can be considered.
  
2. **Eosinophilic Fasciitis** – Similar indurated and shiny skin lesions, often affecting extremities but occasionally can involve other areas.

3. **Lichen Sclerosus** – It presents with shiny, white plaques which can become sclerotic.

4. **Neck Dermatitis Artefacta** – Although denied, it's an important consideration when mechanical manipulation is suspected.

5. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans** – Persistent, as well as indurated plaques without a clear cause, might suggest a rare, slow-growing skin tumor.

6. **Granuloma Annulare** – Can present with indurated skin lesions but usually in a ring form.

7. **Cutaneous Sarcoidosis** – Presents with indurated skin lesions but usually on extremities, faintly on the trunk.

8. **Hypertrophic Lichen Planus** – Shiny, raised, indurated lesions, more pronounced around the wrists and ankles but warrants consideration.

9. **Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum** – Although typically involves neck with skin-colored papules forming a cobblestone appearance.

10. **Neurofibromatosis** – Characterized by nodules and could occasionally present with skin changes, though usually with a distinct café-au-lait spots and freckling.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

Considering all available patient information and the test (biopsy) results, we now rerank the differential diagnosis:

1. **Linear Scleroderma (Morphea)** – The most likely given the indurated, shiny, well-defined, sclerotic nature and lack of systemic involvement typically seen in scleroderma.
  
2. **Eosinophilic Fasciitis** – Close resemblance in the presentation but less common, needs to be ruled out via biopsy.

3. **Lichen Sclerosus** – Shiny, sclerotic plaques; however, typically more involved in genital areas.

4. **Granuloma Annulare** – If the biopsy showed granulomatous inflammation, it might be highly considered.

5. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans** – Should be considered if there is a history of enlarging plaques over months/years.

6. **Hypertrophic Lichen Planus** – Possible but needs a biopsy confirmation showing lichenoid infiltrate.

7. **Cutaneous Sarcoidosis** – If the biopsy showed non-caseating granulomas.

8. **Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum** – Less typical presentation, often with yellowish and softer lesions.

9. **Neck Dermatitis Artefacta** – If there's strong suspicion of mechanical manipulation despite patient denial, important but less likely without clear evidence.

10. **Neurofibromatosis** – Unlikely due to lack of other systemic manifestations (café-au-lait spots, Lisch nodules, etc.).","['Pediatrics', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Dermatology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1.0,F

### INPUT:
A 58-year-old woman with interstitial cystitis presented for pentosan polysulfate (Elmiron) maculopathy screening. She reported no visual symptoms or ocular history, and routine eye examination results 6 months prior were reportedly normal. She was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis in 2004 and had been taking pentosan polysulfate, 100 mg twice daily, for 4½ years for a cumulative dose of 324 g. Her medical history was otherwise significant for moderate bilateral hearing loss detected in early childhood and type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism treated with a therapeutic regimen of metformin, pravastatin, and levothyroxine supplementation, respectively. At presentation, her visual acuity was 20/20−2 OD and 20/20 OS, intraocular pressures by rebound tonometry were normal, and anterior segment examination results were unremarkable. She had trace cortical cataracts and nuclear sclerosis in each eye. Dilated fundus examination in each eye revealed cup-disc ratios of 0.2, mild retinal pigment epithelium mottling, and scattered, deep punctate, hypopigmented lesions. Macular optical coherence tomography imaging demonstrated trace irregularity to the outer retinal bands. Fundus autofluorescence imaging showed irregularly distributed speckled hypoautofluorescence in the posterior pole of each eye (Figure). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Congenital rubella syndrome,"Let's proceed step by step to develop a differential diagnosis for the patient.

### Initial Differential Diagnoses

1. **Pentosan Polysulfate Maculopathy**
   - Given the patient's long-term use of pentosan polysulfate (Elmiron), maculopathy associated with this medication must be considered.

2. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**
   - Common in older adults and could explain some of the retinal findings and visual acuity issues.

3. **Diabetic Retinopathy**
   - The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes, making diabetic retinopathy a possible diagnosis.

4. **Central Serous Retinopathy**
   - Although less common in women, this condition can cause disturbances in the retinal pigment epithelium and visual disturbances.

5. **Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) Dysfunction**
   - Given the RPE mottling seen on examination, a primary disorder of the RPE could be considered.

6. **Pattern Dystrophy**
   - Can present with irregularities in the retinal pigment epithelium and speckled autofluorescence patterns.

7. **Drug-Induced Cataracts**
   - Cortical cataracts and nuclear sclerosis can be medication-related or age-related.

8. **Retinal Dystrophy**
   - A broader category that could include several specific dystrophies affecting the retina.

9. **Epiretinal Membrane**
   - Could explain some of the subtle outer retinal changes seen on imaging.

10. **Macular Telangiectasia (MacTel)**
   - Can present with irregular hypoautofluorescence and subtle changes in the macula.

### Reranking Based on Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Pentosan Polysulfate Maculopathy**
   - Strongly supported by the patient's medication history and the specific retinal findings observed.

2. **Diabetic Retinopathy**
   - Diabetes is a major risk factor for retinal changes, but the specific findings do not entirely align with typical diabetic retinopathy.

3. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**
   - Given the patient's age, AMD remains a significant possibility, though the findings might be more indicative of drug-induced changes.

4. **RPE Dysfunction**
   - Consistent with the mottling of the RPE observed.

5. **Pattern Dystrophy**
   - Could explain the speckled autofluorescence and may fit with the imaging results.

6. **Retinal Dystrophy**
   - A broader category but less specific compared to the more targeted diagnoses.

7. **Central Serous Retinopathy**
   - Less likely due to the demographic, but still possible given the presentation.

8. **Macular Telangiectasia (MacTel)**
   - Possible but less likely without more specific findings for MacTel.

9. **Epiretinal Membrane**
   - Retains a lower probability due to lack of more characteristic membrane changes.

10. **Drug-Induced Cataracts**
    - The cataracts are noted but are not primary in explaining the retinal findings.

### INPUT:
An 82-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with 2 months of diarrhea and 2 weeks of rash. She had sustained a left radius fracture 6 months prior, which resulted in deconditioning and poor appetite. Her diet consisted of mostly vegetables, and she lost 4 kg (8.8 lb) during this time. Two months prior, she developed postprandial nonbloody diarrhea that occurred 5 times daily. Two weeks prior, a pruritic rash in her extremities emerged. She had no fever, night sweats, or abdominal pain. Past medical history included chronic nondeforming rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, and colon adenocarcinoma resected 10 years prior. Her medications were prednisolone (1 mg/d) and levothyroxine. On examination, she was afebrile, with blood pressure 90/46 mm Hg; pulse, 90/min and regular; and respirations, 18/min. Body mass index was 16.8 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). She was alert, cognitively intact, and appeared emaciated. Glossitis and a scaly pruritic rash with an erythematous brawny peeling base on her neck and extremities were noted (Figure). Findings on cardiovascular, pulmonary, abdominal, and neurologic examinations were unremarkable. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pellagra,"Let's proceed step by step with differential diagnoses to identify the potential cause(s) for this patient's symptoms, then we can rerank based on test results and full patient context.

1. **Celiac Disease** 
   - Due to chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and rash.

2. **Zinc Deficiency** 
   - Consider the pruritic rash, weight loss, and poor diet.

3. **Dermatitis Herpetiformis**
   - Linked to rash and gluten sensitivity.

4. **Pellagra (Niacin Deficiency)** 
   - Due to diarrhea, dermatologic symptoms, and poor diet.

5. **Hypothyroidism** 
   - Despite being on levothyroxine, still possible due to symptoms contributing to general condition.

6. **Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)** 
   - Chronic diarrhea, weight loss, especially in the elderly.

7. **Chronic Pancreatitis** 
   - Could explain malabsorption presenting with diarrhea and weight loss.

8. **Adrenal Insufficiency** 
   - Given the hypotension and potential chronic use of steroids.

9. **Hyperthyroidism** 
   - Despite chronic hypothyroidism, symptoms like weight loss and diarrhea might fit.

10. **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)** 
   - Functional GI disorder presenting with chronic diarrhea.

### Reranking Based on Full Patient Context and Examination Findings

1. **Pellagra (Niacin Deficiency)** 
   - Glossitis, scaly rash, weight loss, diarrhea, and poor diet are classic symptoms.

2. **Zinc Deficiency** 
   - Rash and poor appetite fit well, especially given her restrictive diet post-injury.

3. **Celiac Disease** 
   - Chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and a possible gluten-sensitive rash.

4. **Adrenal Insufficiency** 
   - Symptoms could align with steroid use, hypotension, and general fatigue.

5. **Dermatitis Herpetiformis** 
   - Strongly linked with gluten sensitivity, fitting the chronic gastrointestinal symptoms and rash.

6. **Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)** 
   - Chronic diarrhea with potential malabsorption explains weight loss and GI upset.

7. **Chronic Pancreatitis** 
   - Persistent diarrhea and weight loss may indicate malabsorption.

8. **Hypothyroidism** 
   - Though less likely to be directly responsible given ongoing treatment, possible subtherapeutic management.

9. **Hyperthyroidism** 
   - Unlikely but possible with chronic conditions resulting in low BMI and diarrhea.

10. **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)** 
   - Functional diagnosis of exclusion, less likely with her serious systematic symptoms and history.

This ranking considers the breadth and nature of her symptoms, balancing acute and chronic considerations of her medical history and clinical presentation.","['Dermatology', 'Geriatrics', 'Nutrition', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology', 'Gastroenterology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,82.0,F

### INPUT:
A 70-year-old White woman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia was referred to our institution for evaluation of bilateral asymmetric corneal lesions by her primary eye care professional. The patient required spectacles for best-corrected visual acuity but otherwise had no other significant ocular complaints. She was not taking medications known to cause corneal depositions, nor was there a known family history of corneal dystrophy. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Slitlamp examination of the cornea of the right eye revealed multiple, discrete nodular opacities in the superior and inferior quadrants without neovascularization or surface elevation. Similar findings were seen in the left eye, but the superior lesions were notable for possessing well-circumscribed, plaquelike features located in the posterior stroma without involvement of the anterior surface (Figure, A). No crystalline changes were noted with these deposits. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Salzmann's Nodular Degeneration:** This condition involves the formation of nodular opacities in the cornea, often linked to previous inflammation or trauma. The description of multiple discrete nodular opacities could point to this diagnosis.

2. **Granular Corneal Dystrophy:** Characterized by sharply demarcated, whitish opacities, this dystrophy often presents without significant symptoms until more advanced stages, but the patient's history and lack of family history make this less likely.

3. **Lattice Corneal Dystrophy:** Corneal deposits characteristic of this dystrophy could initially appear as nodules or opacities, but crystalline changes are usually noted, which are not observed here.

4. **Band Keratopathy:** This condition involves calcium deposits in the superficial cornea, typically appearing linear or band-like and not nodular.

5. **Terrien's Marginal Degeneration:** This causes peripheral thinning and opacification but usually presents with vascularization, which is absent here.

6. **Crocodile Shagreen:** Results in polygonal opacities mostly in the anterior stroma, but not typically appearing as discrete nodular opacities.

7. **Schnyder Corneal Dystrophy:** Potentially causes crystalline and non-crystalline deposits in the cornea but often has a familial history and is associated with crystalline changes.

8. **Central Cloudy Dystrophy of François:** Characterized primarily by ground-glass opacities centrally rather than discrete nodules.

9. **Corneal Arcus:** Typically presents as peripheral corneal opacities and is associated with hyperlipidemia, but does not cause discrete nodular opacities.

10. **Corneal Guttata:** These are endothelial changes rather than anterior or stromal deposits and often present as beaten metal appearances on the endothelium.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

By synthesizing all patient data and test results:
1. **Salzmann's Nodular Degeneration:** Correlates closely with the patient's age and the appearance of nodular opacities in the cornea.
2. **Lattice Corneal Dystrophy:** Although crystalline changes are not noted, this dystrophy can present similarly.
3. **Granular Corneal Dystrophy:** This is possible, but the absence of a family history and different classic presentation reduce its likelihood.
4. **Schnyder Corneal Dystrophy:** The lack of crystalline changes and family history for corneal dystrophy decrease its likelihood.
5. **Crocodile Shagreen:** The presentation does not match typical polygonal opacities.
6. **Band Keratopathy:** Calcium deposits typically have a different appearance and distribution.
7. **Terrien's Marginal Degeneration:** The absence of vascularization and typical peripheral involvement downgrades this possibility.
8. **Central Cloudy Dystrophy of François:** Central rather than discrete nodular.
9. **Corneal Arcus:** More commonly peripheral and band-like.
10. **Corneal Guttata:** Related to endothelial changes, not anterior or stromal nodules.

The patient’s specific clinical findings with bilateral asymmetric corneal lesions, nodular opacities, and lack of crystalline deposition make **Salzmann's Nodular Degeneration** the most likely diagnosis.","['Cornea', 'Ophthalmology', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Risk Factors', 'Hypertension']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,70.0,F

### INPUT:
A 28-year-old man presented to his primary care physician for hematochezia. He had previously lived for a few years in Uganda and frequently swam in the Nile River. After returning to the US, he experienced recurrent diarrhea. In April 2018, he had an appendectomy for acute appendicitis. In February 2019, 22 months after his return from Uganda, he developed intermittent hematochezia. He had no vomiting, fever, or weight loss during this time. On evaluation, vital signs were normal and abdominal examination showed a soft, nontender abdomen. Rectal examination was normal. A complete blood cell count and comprehensive metabolic panel were notable for a normal hemoglobin level and an absolute eosinophil count of 304 cells/μL. Results of testing including stool microscopy, HIV fourth-generation assay, hepatitis B serologies, and a rectal swab for gonorrhea and chlamydia were negative. A colonoscopy demonstrated granular mucosa in the rectum. Internal hemorrhoids were present, but there were no masses, vascular malformations, or other abnormalities. A biopsy of rectal tissue was obtained; histopathologic features are shown in the Figure. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Schistosomiasis,"Let's approach the differential diagnosis step by step.

1. **Schistosomiasis**: Given the patient's history of living in Uganda and swimming in the Nile River, exposure to freshwater containing schistosomes is a key clue.
2. **Ulcerative Colitis**: Hematochezia and granular mucosa on colonoscopy could be indicative of an inflammatory bowel disease.
3. **Amoebiasis**: History of living in an area where Entamoeba histolytica is endemic and presenting with hematochezia increases the suspicion.
4. **Crohn's Disease**: Another form of inflammatory bowel disease that might present with intermittent hematochezia.
5. **Rectal Polyps**: Can cause hematochezia and granular mucosa detected on colonoscopy.
6. **Infectious Colitis**: Although initial stool tests were negative, certain infections can intermittently present with such symptoms.
7. **Angiodysplasia**: A vascular abnormality that might present without visible masses but cause bleeding.
8. **Colorectal Cancer**: Although less likely due to age, cannot be ruled out completely.
9. **Ischemic Colitis**: Presents with hematochezia, typically in older patients but can occur in younger patients with certain risk factors.
10. **Radiation Proctitis**: Unlikely here due to no known history of radiation, but a potential cause of granular mucosa in the rectum.

### Re-ranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Schistosomiasis**: High suspicion due to the geographical history.
2. **Amoebiasis**: Given the endemic area and symptoms of hematochezia.
3. **Ulcerative Colitis**: Consistent with clinical and histopathological features.
4. **Crohn's Disease**: Fits with the symptoms of intermittent bleeding.
5. **Infectious Colitis**: Need to reconsider other infectious agents given the negative results.
6. **Rectal Polyps**: Could account for granular mucosa and bleeding.
7. **Angiodysplasia**: Can present without obvious vascular malformations on initial examination.
8. **Ischemic Colitis**: Less likely given the patient’s age but still a potential cause.
9. **Colorectal Cancer**: Lower down the list due to age but must be ruled out.
10. **Radiation Proctitis**: Least likely but considered for completeness.

Thus, the differential diagnosis is robustly re-ranked considering the history, examination, and test results provided.","['Gastroenterology', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,28.0,M

### INPUT:
A woman in her 50s presented with an edematous, massively enlarged right auricle. The patient had immigrated to Israel 9 years before admission. She was adamant that the lesion had been present since early childhood but had gradually increased with a recent appearance of foul-smelling otorrhea. On examination, the auricle was markedly enlarged, edematous, and encircled by an erythematous, indurated plaque partially covered with a fine scale (Figure 1A). Diascopy revealed an “apple jelly” appearance. There was no local or distant lymphadenopathy; general physical examination findings were unremarkable. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Lupus vulgaris,"Sure, let's go through the differential diagnosis step by step based on the patient's presentation:

### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Lupus vulgaris**  
Characteristic apple jelly appearance upon diascopy points to this likely diagnosis.

2. **Leishmaniasis**  
The geography and chronicity of the lesion raise suspicion for a parasitic skin infection.

3. **Cutaneous sarcoidosis**  
Long-standing indurated plaques could be indicative of this condition.

4. **Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Infection**  
Chronic granulomatous presentation fits this possibility.

5. **Basal Cell Carcinoma**  
Carcinomatous changes could present in an indolent, chronic disorder.

6. **Kaposi's Sarcoma**  
Though less likely without immunocompromise, persistent plaques warrant consideration.

7. **Chronic Lymphedema**  
Chronic edematous changes typically seen in long-standing lymphedema.

8. **Dermatophyte Infection**  
Fungal infections can present with chronic, indurated plaques, although less likely with absence of lymphadenopathy.

9. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus**  
Chronic, indurated plaques and absence of systemic signs might suggest this form of lupus.

10. **Lichen Simplex Chronicus**  
Chronic skin condition characterized by lichenification due to persistent itching and scratching.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis after further testing and patient history:

1. **Lupus vulgaris**  
The apple jelly appearance on diascopy is highly suggestive, making this the top differential.

2. **Leishmaniasis**  
Patient history of immigration and chronicity makes this a strong contender.

3. **Cutaneous sarcoidosis**  
Granulomatous disease with skin involvement could present similarly.

4. **Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Infection**  
Chronic granulomatous presentation could indicate non-tuberculous mycobacteria.

5. **Basal Cell Carcinoma**  
Persistent, indurated plaques warrant this consideration.

6. **Kaposi's Sarcoma**  
Chronicity and presentation should keep this in the differential, especially considering geographical factors.

7. **Chronic Lymphedema**  
Though not primary, chronic edema adds to suspicion.

8. **Dermatophyte Infection**  
Though less likely by appearance, still a remote possibility.

9. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus**  
Chronic, localized plaques push this higher than initial lower likelihood.

10. **Lichen Simplex Chronicus**  
Lichenification due to chronic scratching places it in the differential cube, though less probable due to presentation specifics.

Given the patient's history, clinical presentation, geographical background, and characteristic findings on diascopy, Lupus vulgaris stands out as the most probable diagnosis.","['Infectious Diseases', 'Tuberculosis', 'Dermatology', 'Global Health']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,50.0,F

### INPUT:
A 78-year-old man presented with decreased visual acuity and hypopyon in his right eye. He had a history of Philadelphia chromosome–positive acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (attributable to treatment with the tyrosine-kinase inhibitor [TKI] imatinib), and diabetes. He had senile dementia but did not complain of constitutional symptoms. His visual acuity was 20/80 OD and 20/32 OS, and his intraocular pressures were 31 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. A slitlamp examination of the right eye showed redness, with small, white, nongranulomatous keratic precipitate as well as a cataract. His iris was diffusely thickened and the anterior chamber was slightly shallow, with 4+ cells and white hypopyon, which did not change position with head movements (Figure 1). There was also an extensive rubeosis iridis (Figure 1) with posterior synechiae in the right eye. The left anterior chamber was normal. A fundus examination had unremarkable results in both eyes. A complete blood cell count had normal results, and his hemoglobin A1c level was 16.5%. A syphilis test result was negative. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Intraocular relapse of ALL,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Endophthalmitis**: Based on the presentation of hypopyon, decreased visual acuity, and history of diabetes, endophthalmitis could be a primary concern.
2. **Uveitis**: The finding of 4+ cells in the anterior chamber and white hypopyon suggests an inflammatory process.
3. **Neovascular Glaucoma**: The extensive rubeosis iridis and elevated intraocular pressure in the right eye are classic signs.
4. **Acute Leukemia Relapse**: Given the history of Philadelphia chromosome–positive ALL and the immunocompromised state, relapse with ocular involvement can be considered.
5. **Ocular Infection**: Considering his extensive medical history, an opportunistic ocular infection is possible.
6. **Immune Recovery Uveitis (IRU)**: Following cessation of immunosuppressive therapy, this condition should be considered.
7. **Lens-induced Uveitis (Phacogenic Uveitis)**: The presence of a cataract and uveitis can indicate a phacogenic uveitis.
8. **Pseudo-Hypopyon (Pigment Dispersion)**: The hypopyon not changing position with head movements raises the consideration of pseudo-hypopyon.
9. **Drug-Induced Uveitis**: His history suggests a possible adverse drug reaction causing inflammation.
10. **Diabetic Retinopathy with Secondary Glaucoma**: Although not directly presenting with typical symptoms, his diabetes could lead to such complications.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis with All Information

1. **Neovascular Glaucoma**: Elevated intraocular pressure and extensive rubeosis iridis are most consistent with this diagnosis.
2. **Endophthalmitis**: The presence of hypopyon and diabetes places this high on the list.
3. **Uveitis**: The inflammatory cells (4+ cells) and hypopyon support this diagnosis.
4. **Acute Leukemia Relapse**: History of ALL with potential ocular involvement places it as a significant consideration.
5. **Lens-induced Uveitis (Phacogenic Uveitis)**: Cataract presence and anterior chamber inflammation are suggestive.
6. **Pseudo-Hypopyon (Pigment Dispersion)**: Unchanging hypopyon position aligns with pseudo-hypopyon, though less common.
7. **Ocular Infection**: Opportunistic infections need consideration due to diabetes and immunocompromised history.
8. **Drug-Induced Uveitis**: Previous Stevens-Johnson syndrome from TKI treatment suggests this, but no current drug details.
9. **Diabetic Retinopathy with Secondary Glaucoma**: Potential complication from diabetes, though not the main presentation.
10. **Immune Recovery Uveitis (IRU)**: Less likely but possible given his immunosuppressive history.

### INPUT:
A healthy 15-year-old male patient presented with several years of bilateral congestion and hyposmia. He and his family denied facial trauma, recent or recurrent sinusitis, rhinorrhea, difficulty breathing, pain, change in vision, and constitutional symptoms. He had never had allergy testing but did have occasional allergic symptoms, including sneezing and itchy eyes and nose. He did not report any drug, alcohol, or tobacco use. He was developmentally normal. On physical examination, the patient appeared healthy and had a normal-sounding voice. The tonsils were small, without crypts or tonsilloliths, and there were no neck masses. A flexible fiberoptic nasal endoscopy was performed, and its findings showed bilateral and symmetric inferior turbinate hypertrophy without erythema, exudate, or ulceration, and without mucoid rhinorrhea (Figure 1A). There were no intranasal masses, lesions, or polyps. The patient was prescribed intranasal steroid spray, oral antihistamines, and sinonasal saline rinses, and was instructed to return to our clinic in 4 to 6 weeks, but was subsequently lost to follow-up. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Foreign body,"Sure, let's go through the differential diagnosis process step by step for the 15-year-old male patient. 

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Allergic Rhinitis** 
   - Given the symptoms of bilateral congestion, hyposmia, occasional sneezing, and itchy eyes and nose, allergic rhinitis is a strong possibility.

2. **Chronic Nonallergic Rhinitis**
   - Chronic symptoms without signs of sinusitis or evident polyps suggest a nonallergic rhinitis as another possibility.

3. **Vasomotor Rhinitis**
   - The presence of nasal congestion without typical allergic triggers or sinus infections may indicate vasomotor rhinitis.

4. **Nasal Septal Deviation**
   - Structural anomalies, such as a deviated septum, can cause chronic nasal congestion and could be considered next.

5. **Adenoid Hypertrophy**
   - Although less common in adolescents, enlarged adenoids can lead to chronic nasal congestion.

6. **Nasal Valve Collapse**
   - Issues with nasal valve function could cause chronic congestion and should be considered.

7. **Chronic Rhinosinusitis without Polyps**
   - While no sinusitis is reported, a mild and ongoing chronic condition without polyp formation remains a possibility.

8. **Cystic Fibrosis**
   - Though less likely given other typical symptoms are absent, CF can present with nasal polyps and chronic congestion.

9. **Environmental Irritants**
   - Chronic exposure to environmental irritants (like secondhand smoke or pollutants) could result in similar symptoms.

10. **Hormonal Rhinitis**
    - Hormonal changes in adolescence could potentially contribute to rhinitis symptoms, albeit rare.

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnosis

Reevaluating all available information:
1. **Allergic Rhinitis**
2. **Chronic Nonallergic Rhinitis**
3. **Vasomotor Rhinitis**
4. **Nasal Septal Deviation**
5. **Adenoid Hypertrophy**
6. **Nasal Valve Collapse**
7. **Chronic Rhinosinusitis without Polyps**
8. **Environmental Irritants**
9. **Hormonal Rhinitis**
10. **Cystic Fibrosis**

**Rationale:** 
- The consistent symptomatology pointing towards allergic rhinitis, and less likelihood of structural/developmental anomalies or fibrosis-related issues, informed this rank order.
- Environmental factors are re-evaluated to maintain their place based on presented history. 
- Hormonal changes are relatively rare to be the driver.

### INPUT:
A woman in her late 30s was evaluated by the dermatology inpatient consult service for a 4-day history of perianal pain. Her medical history included systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and external hemorrhoids. Six months before admission, she underwent a deceased donor kidney transplant. One month before presentation, she was hospitalized for acute cellular transplant rejection managed with systemic corticosteroids, belatacept, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus therapies. Her immunosuppressive regimen at the time of dermatologic evaluation consisted of prednisone, 5 mg daily, and mycophenolate mofetil, 500 mg twice daily. On admission, she was afebrile and normotensive; laboratory results were notable for an elevated creatinine level of 1.43 mg/dL (reference range, 0.40-1.30 mg/dL) (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 92 × 103/μL [reference range, 140-440 × 103/μL] [conversion to ×109 per liter is 1:1). She developed diarrhea 1 day after admission. Fecal leukocytes were absent. Stool antigen test results for cryptosporidium, giardia, and rotavirus were negative. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results for campylobacter, norovirus, salmonella, shigella, Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli 1 and 2, Vibrio cholerae, and Yersinia enterocolitica in the stool were negative. Antigen and toxin test results for Clostridium difficile in the stool were positive. Total body skin examination was notable for 1- and 3-cm tender, round perianal ulcers with a clean base. Another 4-mm round ulcer was present at the superior intergluteal cleft (Figure, A). There were no ocular or oral ulcers. A biopsy specimen of a perianal ulcer border was obtained for histopathologic analysis (Figure, B-D).

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Infectious Colitis Due to Clostridium difficile** - Positive test results for C. difficile antigen and toxin. The patient is on immunosuppressive therapy, which increases susceptibility to infections including C. difficile colitis.
2. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection** - Immunosuppressive state and round perianal ulcers are consistent with HSV infections, though not explicitly tested here.
3. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection** - CMV can cause ulceration in immunocompromised patients, including those with a history of kidney transplant and on immunosuppressive drugs.
4. **Neutropenic Ulceration** - Given the patient’s thrombocytopenia and immunosuppressive therapy, neutropenia leading to ulceration is a consideration.
5. **Drug-induced Ulceration** - Mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids can cause ulcerations as a side effect.
6. **Aphthous Ulcers (part of an Inflammatory Bowel Disease such as Crohn’s)** - Considering diarrhea and ulcer presentation, although the PCR tests for common pathogens were negative, ulcers could be related to underlying inflammatory processes.
7. **Non-Infectious Colitis/Ischemic Colitis** - Given her elevated creatinine levels and history of autoimmune disease, she might be prone to vascular issues.
8. **Syphilitic Ulcer** - Although her recent history doesn't dose-predict explicitly for syphilis, it's a consideration in sexually active patients presenting with perianal ulcers.
9. **Behçet's Disease** - Although her systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) fits into an autoimmune spectrum, the absence of oral and ocular ulcers makes Behçet's less likely but still relevant given the presence of genital ulcers.
10. **Fungal Infection (such as Candida)** - While it is an important consideration in immunosuppressed patients, the clinical presentation does not strongly suggest this as the primary cause.

Based on the combination of the patient's symptoms, history, lab results, and the infectious disease testing performed, **Infectious Colitis Due to Clostridium difficile** is the top differential diagnosis given her positive C. difficile test results and immunosuppressed state.","['Dermatology', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology', 'Gastroenterology', 'Surgery']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,39.0,F

2. **Cellulitis** - Common bacterial skin infection presenting with erythema and could cause fever.
3. **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)** - Given lower extremity trauma and local edema, DVT is a significant concern.
4. **Vasculitis** - Presence of purpura and petechiae suggests possible involvement of vasculature.
5. **Erysipelas** - Consider if there is sharp demarcation and involves the superficial layers of skin.
6. **Reactive Arthritis** - Consider given history of trauma which may trigger this condition.
7. **Erythema Nodosum** - Inflammation of fat under the skin, but usually presents with painful nodules.
8. **Thrombophlebitis** - Inflammation of veins, indicated by erythema and swelling.
9. **Venous Insufficiency** - Chronic condition that could present with leg edema and erythema, but less likely in acute fever.
10. **Contact Dermatitis** - Given localized skin changes, it could be due to exposure to irritants or allergens.

### Conclusion
Based on the sequential approach and using the complete patient presentation, post-traumatic osteomyelitis comes to the top due to the specific circumstances surrounding the trauma history, symptoms, and physical findings, while considerations of cellulitis, DVT, and vasculitis remain pertinent differentials.","['Venous Thromboembolism', 'Trauma and Injury', 'Dermatology', 'Orthopedics']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,48.0,M

### INPUT:
A 19-month-old boy presented for evaluation of widespread edema and acute dermatitis. Following an upper respiratory tract infection 1 month prior, he developed disseminated red, scaly patches and a progressive eruption of hyperpigmented and hypopigmented patches of skin. He had occasional nonbloody loose stools but no fevers or vomiting. Although he was otherwise well, his growth had fallen from the 75th to the 25th percentile for height and weight over the preceding 9 months, and he could speak only 2 words. His medical history was notable for atopic dermatitis and diarrhea in infancy that prompted allergy testing at age 6 months; he was subsequently diagnosed with milk, egg, and peanut allergies. His parents avoided feeding him these foods, providing him only soy-based milk and formula, with improvement of dermatitis, until age 1 year. Since then his diet had consisted of multiple rice milk feeds daily, supplemented only with pureed fruits and vegetables, pasta, snack puffs, and sunflower butter. The patient had no history of meconium ileus or family history of cystic fibrosis. There was no recent travel and no changes to the home environment. On presentation, the patient was irritable, with normal vital signs. He displayed prominent scrotal swelling and pitting edema of the legs bilaterally. Skin examination was notable for erythematous, denuded patches with peeling scale and reticulate hyperpigmentation, accentuated on the abdomen, back, diaper area, and extensor extremities (Figure; left panel). Notably, his skin also demonstrated widespread patches of hypopigmentation, with an accompanying band of hypopigmentation proximally at the site of newest hair growth (Figure; right panel). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Kwashiorkor,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

**Step 1:** Kwashiorkor  
- Justification: The diet is severely limited, and symptoms like edema, dermatitis, and poor growth are classic signs.

**Step 2:** Zinc Deficiency (Acrodermatitis Enteropathica)  
- Justification: Diarrhea, poor growth, and dermatitis are indicative. Zinc deficiency can cause periorificial and acral dermatitis.

**Step 3:** Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency  
- Justification: Restricted diet. Symptoms include growth delay and dermatitis.

**Step 4:** Celiac Disease  
- Justification: Presents with growth faltering, diarrhea, and dermatitis (dermatitis herpetiformis).

**Step 5:** Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)  
- Justification: History of recurrent infections, failure to thrive, and dermatitis can point towards immunodeficiency.

**Step 6:** Biotin Deficiency  
- Justification: Presents with dermatitis, alopecia, and developmental delay.

**Step 7:** Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis  
- Justification: Can present with skin eruptions similar to eczema and failure to thrive.

**Step 8:** Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome  
- Justification: History of atopic dermatitis, immunodeficiency, and growth faltering.

**Step 9:** Hemochromatosis  
- Justification: Though rare in this age, could explain skin changes and failure to thrive secondary to liver dysfunction.

**Step 10:** Hartnup Disease  
- Justification: Could explain the dermatitis and developmental delay due to malabsorption of amino acids.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information:

1. **Kwashiorkor** - The clinical presentation of edema and dermatitis, combined with the severely limited diet.
2. **Zinc Deficiency (Acrodermatitis Enteropathica)** - Given the dermatitis, diarrhea, and growth failure, especially with the restricted diet.
3. **Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency** - The restricted diet, growth failure, and dermatitis suggest nutritional deficiencies.
4. **Celiac Disease** - Growth faltering, diarrhea, and dermatitis are consistent with this diagnosis.
5. **Biotin Deficiency** - Dermatitis and developmental delays fit this, considering the restricted diet.
6. **Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)** - History of infections and failure to thrive could point here, though a bit less likely without stronger evidence of recurrent infections.
7. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - The rash and growth failure suggest this, but it's less common.
8. **Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome** - Eczema, immunodeficiency, and growth faltering fit, but family history and blood issues aren't noted.
9. **Hartnup Disease** - Fits the dermatitis and developmental delay due to malabsorption, though still rare.
10. **Hemochromatosis** - Unusual in a toddler, but fits some aspects if liver dysfunction was contributing to the symptoms.

### INPUT:
A man in his 60s presented as a transfer from an outside hospital. The division of dermatology was consulted for evaluation of lesions on the face, chest, back, and arms that were gradually increasing in size and number over the past year. Physical examination revealed leonine facies with madarosis and an eschar on the nasal dorsum (Figure, A). Red-to-brown dome-shaped papules coalescing into plaques were present on the upper extremities. The lesions were nontender and nonpruritic. Cervical and axillary lymph nodes were palpable. The patient had a muffled voice and reported shortness of breath with exertion. Results of laboratory investigation demonstrated marked leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 77.5 × 103/uL with 76.5% lymphocytes. No blasts were present on peripheral smear. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis demonstrated multiple enlarged mediastinal, axillary, subpectoral, abdominopelvic, and inguinal lymph nodes. Small pulmonary nodules were also detected. A punch biopsy was obtained from the right arm (Figure, B, C, and D).

4. **Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL)** – Associated with systemic spread and leukocytosis.
5. **Castleman Disease** – Lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms.
6. **Lepra (Leprosy)** – Consider due to skin manifestations and nerve involvement (e.g., madarosis).
7. **Sarcoidosis** – Systemic granulomatous disease, though leukocytosis less typical.
8. **Disseminated Histoplasmosis** – Immunocompromised patients often have systemic megalomanic lesions.
9. **Secondary Syphilis** – Can present with skin and systemic symptoms, but less likely without specific serologic findings.

### INPUT:
A 16-year-old boy with acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage developed tender, 1- to 2-cm erythematous plaques and nodules during treatment with chemotherapy. Previously, he had been well, with morphological remission found on a recent bone marrow biopsy. The patient had no significant dermatological history, except an allergy to cashew nuts and a prior episode (6 mo) of urticaria during a platelet transfusion that had resolved with 1 dose of oral antihistamine. The patient’s medications included ondansetron, aprepitant, prednisolone, and oxycodone (supportive care initiated with chemotherapy), and long-term posaconazole and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole treatment. Lesions were noted on day 2 of the fourth cycle of a chemotherapy regimen comprising fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim (G-CSF). Initially present over the distal limbs, palms, and soles, the lesions progressed to the proximal limbs and lower trunk during 24 hours (Figure, A and B). The patient developed a fever, which we extensively investigated. Intravenous cefotaxime was commenced, but because no infectious source was identified, the fever was thought to be secondary to cytarabine.

### INPUT:
An 18-year-old man with unremarkable medical history was referred to the oculoplastics service for evaluation of progressive gradual-onset ptosis and ophthalmoplegia in both eyes in the past 2 years (Figure). He had emigrated from Ghana 2 years before but denied any illness there. His visual acuity without correction was 20/20 OD and 20/20 OS, although he had to manually elevate his eyelids to see the Snellen chart. He had no movement of the right eye past midline in elevation, adduction, depression, and abduction and no movement of the left eye past midline in elevation, depression, and abduction, with 50% deficit of adduction. His external examination results were notable for a margin reflex distance 1 of −4 mm OU and a levator function of 0 OU. On funduscopic examination, his optic nerves were sharp and pink without atrophy, maculae and retinal vasculature were normal, and peripheral retina appeared normal without pigment abnormalities. A review of systems was negative for fatigue, generalized muscle weakness, or neurologic deficits. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Kearns-Sayre syndrome,"Let's go through a thorough differential diagnosis step by step:

1. **Myasthenia Gravis**: Characterized by ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, often with a fluctuating nature and worsening with exertion due to an autoimmune attack on acetylcholine receptors.

2. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)**: This condition involves progressive ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, typically presenting in young adults, due to mitochondrial DNA mutations.

3. **Kearns-Sayre Syndrome**: A subset of mitochondrial cytopathy, presenting with ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and pigmentary retinopathy, often associated with systemic symptoms like heart block or myopathy.

4. **Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD)**: A hereditary condition marked by ptosis and progressive external ophthalmoplegia, often presenting in older individuals but can vary.

5. **Thyroid Eye Disease (TED)**: Immunologic disorder related to thyroid dysfunction, causing inflammation and stiffness in extraocular muscles, leading to ophthalmoplegia and ptosis.

6. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation (Orbital Pseudotumor)**: Can cause ptosis and restriction of ocular movements due to inflammation and fibrosis of orbital tissues.

7. **Myotonic Dystrophy**: Presents with progressive muscle weakness including facial muscles leading to ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, typically associated with systemic signs like myotonia and cataracts.

8. **Congenital Fibrosis of the Extraocular Muscles (CFEOM)**: Usually presents at birth or early childhood with variable ptosis and significant ocular movement restrictions due to fibrosis of the extraocular muscles.

9. **Guillain-Barre Syndrome**: Though often presenting with more systemic neurological deficits quickly, it can start with ophthalmoplegia and ptosis due to peripheral nerve involvement.

10. **Neurosyphilis**: Rare these days but important to consider; can cause various ophthalmic symptoms including ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, along with systemic neurological signs.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on Full Patient Information:

1. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)**: Fits the age group and gradual onset of symptoms without systemic involvement. Absence of systemic symptoms such as fatigue or muscle weakness broadens scope towards a localized mitochondrial issue.

2. **Myasthenia Gravis**: Despite some atypical features, absent systemic muscle weakness makes it slightly less likely, yet ptosis and ophthalmoplegia keep it high on the list.

3. **Kearns-Sayre Syndrome**: Considered due to the progressive ptosis and ophthalmoplegia; however, absence of systemic features like retinopathy or other organ involvement makes it less likely compared to CPEO.

4. **Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD)**: Though fitting ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, OPMD usually presents later in life but cannot be ruled out completely due to variable presentation.

5. **Congenital Fibrosis of the Extraocular Muscles (CFEOM)**: Presentation with significant restrictive ophthalmoplegia from a young age fits; however, the typical birth presentation makes it less likely.

6. **Myotonic Dystrophy**: Without other systemic symptoms like myotonia, ptosis, and systemic signs makes it less probable.

7. **Thyroid Eye Disease (TED)**: Less likely due to the lack of thyroid-related symptoms or signs of orbital inflammation typically seen with TED.

8. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation**: Can sometimes cause similar symptoms but inflammation and pain are typically present which is not described here.

9. **Guillain-Barre Syndrome**: Lower likelihood given the absence of systemic neurological symptoms typically seen in Guillain-Barre.

10. **Neurosyphilis**: Least likely due to its rarity and typically more systemic neurological signs, and no historical evidence of syphilis exposure.

Based on the information provided, **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)** seems to be the most fitting diagnosis given the patient's presentation of progressive and isolated ophthalmic symptoms.","['Adolescent Medicine', 'Cardiology', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Ophthalmology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,18.0,M

An otherwise healthy man in his 50s was referred to the Department of Dermatology with a 5-year history of an asymptomatic, gradually enlarging, reddish hematomalike plaque with a brownish peripheral border in his left axilla (Figure 1). The patient described the spontaneous onset of the lesion and reported no previous history of trauma or any other systemic symptoms; he had previously applied a topical antifungal cream but observed no lesion improvement. Physical examination revealed a nonindurated and well-defined 10 × 8-cm reddish-brown annular plaque with peripheral ecchymosis. No local lymphadenopathy was observed. Two biopsy specimens were obtained from different areas of the lesion for immunohistochemical studies; vascular channel endothelial cells were positive for CD31, CD34, and D2-40 and negative for human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) (latent nuclear antigen) and Wilms tumor 1 (WT1).

5. **Erythema Annulare Centrifugum (presents with annular plaques but typically has a trailing scale)**

6. **Lymphomatoid Papulosis (a CD30-positive lymphoproliferative disorder, often presents with recurrent papules and nodules)**

7. **Chronic Atrophic Acrodermatitis (associated with Lyme disease, presents with reddish plaques and can develop brownish borders)**

8. **Retiform Purpura (can present with purple, netlike areas, often associated with vasculitis or coagulopathies)**

### INPUT:
A previously healthy young adult presented with 1 week of fatigue, palpitations, and dyspnea on exertion, preceded by fever, myalgias, sore throat, and cough. Emergency department evaluation noted a heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 173/90 mm Hg, and a temperature of 37.1 °C. An electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm with complete heart block (CHB) and a narrow QRS junctional escape at 65 beats per minute (Figure, A). Investigation revealed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 30 mm/h (normal limits, 0-15 mm/h) and a C-reactive protein level of 6.3 mg/dL (reference range, 0.0-1.0 mg/dL [to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10.0]). Tests for kidney function, hepatic function, a complete blood cell count, troponin T levels, creatine kinase levels, thyrotropin levels, antinuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor had normal results, and tests for anti–streptolysin O and anti–DNAse B titers, Lyme IgG and IgM titers, Coxiella burnetti and Bartonella serologies, Epstein-Barr virus serology, and cytomegalovirus quantification had negative results. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no structural abnormalities, while fluorine 18–labeledfluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG-PET–CT) showed a small focal area of FDG uptake in the region of the membranous septum (Figure, B). Systemic FDG uptake was absent. A CT showed no hilar adenopathy or pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities. Over the next 48 hours, the patient’s junctional rhythm accelerated to 90 beats per minute with ventriculoatrial block before acutely degenerating to a narrow complex escape rhythm of 45 beats per minutes associated with lightheadedness (Figure, C).

1. **Infective Endocarditis**  
- Explanation: Given the 1-week history of symptoms combined with elevated inflammatory markers and heart block.

2. **Myocarditis**  
- Explanation: The presentation of fever, myalgias, sore throat, and preceding respiratory symptoms suggests viral involvement causing myocarditis.

3. **Sarcoidosis**  
- Explanation: Considering the small focal area of FDG uptake in the region of the membranous septum and the age of the patient.

4. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**  
- Explanation: Despite normal ANA and RF, SLE could present with heart block and elevated inflammatory markers.

5. **Rheumatic Fever**  
- Explanation: The initial presentation of a sore throat and subsequent progression to heart block could indicate rheumatic disease post-Group A strep infection.

6. **Cardiac Sarcoidosis**  
- Explanation: The cardiac findings and the PET-CT results suggest isolated cardiac sarcoidosis.

7. **Viral Pericarditis**  
- Explanation: The nonspecific viral-like symptoms could mimic this condition, though less likely given the findings.

8. **Idiopathic Complete Heart Block**  
- Explanation: In young adults, idiopathic causes should be considered after major causes are ruled out.

9. **Lymphoma**  
- Explanation: Isolated cardiac involvement might present with heart block and focal uptake on PET-CT.

10. **Brucellosis**  
- Explanation: Although rare, it needs consideration due to varied systemic involvement and its ability to cause myocarditis and heart block.

### Reranked Based on All Information and Test Results

1. **Myocarditis**  
- Strongest consideration due to the presentation, preceding viral-like symptoms, and inflammatory markers.

2. **Cardiac Sarcoidosis**  
- Prominent contender given PET findings of isolated FDG uptake in the membranous septum.

3. **Sarcoidosis**  
- Generalized sarcoidosis could lead to cardiac involvement, though it’s more systemic.

4. **Infective Endocarditis**  
- Lowered in probability with negative serologies and absence of systemic infection markers.

5. **Rheumatic Fever**  
- Unlikely given negative streptococcal serologies, yet should not be entirely excluded.

6. **Viral Pericarditis**  
- Less likely due to clinical presentation and PET-CT findings focusing on myocardium.

7. **Idiopathic Complete Heart Block**  
- Emerges once more common etiologies are eliminated, albeit rare in young adults.

8. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**  
- Very unlikely with negative ANA and normal other autoimmune markers.

9. **Lymphoma**  
- Rare possibility, especially with PET-CT focusing solely on cardiac involvement.

### INPUT:
A 40-year-old previously healthy woman presented to the emergency department with 24 hours of dizziness, imbalance, bilateral lower extremity weakness, blurred vision, chest pain, and a painful rash on the left foot with tenderness of the fingers and toes. In the emergency department, the patient’s temperature was 36.7 °C (98.1 °F); blood pressure, 121/82 mm Hg; pulse, 74/min; respiratory rate, 15/min; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. Physical examination revealed petechiae within a poorly demarcated erythematous patch on the left dorsal foot (Figure 1, left panel), splinter hemorrhages on the right thumbnail (Figure 1, center panel), and petechial macules on the palms and soles, most numerous on the distal digits. There was no murmur or plop on cardiac auscultation. Neurologic examination findings were significant for left eye nystagmus and inability to adduct the right eye on left gaze, consistent with right-sided internuclear ophthalmoplegia. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed 2 acute infarcts in the right cerebellum. Results of laboratory testing were notable for mild leukocytosis (12.2 × 109/L), mild thrombocytosis (439 × 109/L), and elevated troponin level (4.4 ng/mL); results of a comprehensive metabolic panel and the remainder of the complete blood cell count were normal. An electrocardiogram showed T-wave inversions in lead V2, consistent with a non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Transthoracic echocardiogram and cardiac CT angiography (Figure 1, right panel) were performed. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Left atrial myxoma,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps

1. **Endocarditis**: Classic findings of petechiae, splinter hemorrhages, and embolic strokes along with elevated troponin levels suggest the presence of bacterial endocarditis.
2. **Lyme disease**: Neurological findings such as internuclear ophthalmoplegia can suggest Lyme disease, especially if the patient has been in a tick-endemic area.
3. **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: The multi-systemic involvement (neurological, dermatological, and possible cardiac manifestations) can be characteristic of SLE.
4. **Antiphospholipid syndrome**: Can present with thrombotic events, livedo reticularis, and would be consistent with cerebral infarcts and myocardial infarction.
5. **Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)**: The presence of petechiae, infarcts, and elevated neurological findings may suggest TTP.
6. **Multiple sclerosis (MS)**: Account for the neurological findings such as internuclear ophthalmoplegia and cerebellar infarcts.
7. **Giant cell arteritis**: Vascular inflammation leading to multisystem involvement including neurological manifestations and myocardial infarction.
8. **Meningococcemia**: Known for causing petechiae, purpuric rash, and can result in potential multi-organ infarcts.
9. **Vasculitis**: Can explain the petechiae, organ infarcts, and possible systemic involvement.
10. **Neurosyphilis**: Presents with multiple neurological findings, potential cardiac involvement and secondary rash.

### Re-ranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Endocarditis**: The complete clinical picture, including embolic strokes, elevated troponin, and cutaneous findings, fits well with bacterial endocarditis.
2. **Antiphospholipid syndrome**: Given the embolic phenomena and potential myocardial infarction, this is a strong consideration.
3. **Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)**: The neurologic symptoms and petechiae, even with mild thrombocytosis, warrant consideration.
4. **Vasculitis**: Multisystem involvement with neurological, dermatological, and cardiac manifestations could support this diagnosis.
5. **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: The widespread tissue involvement fits, although there is no mention of specific signs or laboratory criteria for lupus.
6. **Giant cell arteritis**: Fits the vascular, neurological, and potential cardiac symptoms, though less common at the patient's age.
7. **Lyme disease**: Can cause neurological issues and rash, although a more common presentation would be different.
8. **Meningococcemia**: Consider the rash and potential for multisystem involvement, though the absence of fever and septic appearance makes this less likely.
9. **Multiple sclerosis (MS)**: The internuclear ophthalmoplegia and cerebellar involvement can fit with MS.
10. **Neurosyphilis**: Neurological findings and rash are consistent, but absence of other hallmarks reduces likelihood.

### INPUT:
A 68-year-old woman presented to the emergency eye clinic with a 3-week history of progressive left eye redness and discomfort unresponsive to topical antibiotics or lubricants, as prescribed by her optometrist. The intraocular pressure (IOP) was raised (26 mm Hg) and was treated with a topical β-blocker. Otherwise, her condition was managed conservatively for presumed viral conjunctivitis. She self-presented 6 days later with intermittent visual blurring, mild eyelid swelling, and conjunctival chemosis. The IOP remained raised (24 mm Hg). An inflammatory or allergic etiology was suspected; therefore, topical corticosteroids and a prostaglandin analogue were also prescribed. One week later at planned follow-up, the patient had dilated and tortuous bulbar blood vessels (Figure 1). Further interrogation of the history revealed a left-sided nonspecific dull headache, constant for the previous 2 months, and an annoying “whooshing” noise in the patient’s left ear. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Carotid-cavernous fistula,"### 10-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma** 
   - Given the raised intraocular pressure and ineffective response to multiple treatments.

2. **Carotid Cavernous Fistula** 
   - Due to the dilation and tortuous appearance of the blood vessels, headache, and ""whooshing"" noise.

3. **Allergic Conjunctivitis** 
   - Considered due to red eye and symptoms unresponsive to initial treatments.

4. **Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma** 
   - Could contribute to elevated IOP and progressive ocular symptoms.

5. **Orbital Cellulitis** 
   - Because of the eyelid swelling and conjunctival chemosis.

6. **Giant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis)** 
   - Given the age, persistent headache, and visual disturbances.

7. **Uveitis** 
   - Inflammation causing eye redness, pain, and possibly increased IOP.

8. **Scleritis** 
   - Severe pain and redness unresponsive to topical antibiotics.

9. **Thyroid Eye Disease** 
   - Eye symptoms with possible association to systemic thyroid issues.

10. **Migraine with Ophthalmoplegia** 
   - Considering the headache and visual disturbances.

### Reranking after Review of Complete Patient Information:

1. **Carotid Cavernous Fistula** 
   - Highest suspicion due to combination of vascular changes, headache, and auditory symptom characteristic of a vascular nature.

2. **Giant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis)** 
   - Persistent headache, age-related risk, and could explain visual symptoms.

3. **Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma** 
   - Consistently raised IOP and age-related risk factor, although additional symptoms might suggest more complex etiology.

4. **Scleritis** 
   - Severe pain and chronic nature not relieved by initial treatment.

5. **Orbital Cellulitis** 
   - Eyelid swelling and chemosis could signal infectious origin.

6. **Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma** 
   - Consideration due to IOP and progressive ocular symptoms.

7. **Thyroid Eye Disease** 
   - Although less common, should consider due to potential systemic involvement.

8. **Uveitis** 
   - Inflammatory symptoms and increased IOP.

9. **Migraine with Ophthalmoplegia** 
   - Headache and visual disturbances; however, less likely given consistent ocular findings and raised IOP.

10. **Allergic Conjunctivitis** 
   - Symptoms align but less prioritized due to more compelling differential above.

### INPUT:
A 42-year-old woman presented with clinical features of microcephaly, short stature, intellectual disability, severe degree of scoliosis, gait abnormality, and encephalopathy (Figure, A and B). She was born in 1973 at 38th week of gestation followed by a normal delivery (weight, 3.15 kg and head circumference, 42 cm) to nonconsanguineous parents. The head size was normal at birth, and no other abnormalities were seen during her infancy. At age 2 years, her parents noticed that she had delayed motor and language milestones. She experienced a progressive developmental delay such as reduction of head growth, loss of acquired communication, and loss of motor functions between ages 9 and 12 years. The severity of scoliosis increased with age, and she became a wheelchair user at age 18 years. She was referred to us at age 40 years with the characteristic features of growth deceleration (height, 142 cm; weight, 22 kg; body mass index, 11 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), apraxia, left-sided hemiplegia, spasticity, sleep apnea, constipation, osteoporosis, hypoalgesia, and repetitive hand tapping (Video). Blood reports showed anemia (hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL; to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (47 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259). There was no history of autistic behavior, vision or hearing impairments, or epilepsy. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with T wave inversion (V3-V6), and echocardiography showed mild cardiomegaly. The brain magnetic resonance imaging studies showed a diffuse reduction in the corpus callosum involving splenium and enlarged right ventricle, resulting in cerebral lateral ventricular asymmetry (Figure, C). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Rett syndrome,"1. Rett Syndrome
2. Angelman Syndrome
3. Cockayne Syndrome
4. Mitochondrial Encephalopathy
5. Joubert Syndrome
6. Ataxia-Telangiectasia
7. Leigh Syndrome
8. Krabbe Disease
9. Aicardi Syndrome
10. Neurofibromatosis Type 1

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses
1. Rett Syndrome: The progressive neurodevelopmental delay, microcephaly (postnatal onset), scoliosis, gait abnormalities, and repetitive hand movements are highly suggestive of Rett Syndrome. The absence of autistic behavior fits the common presentation as well.
2. Mitochondrial Encephalopathy: The encephalopathy, growth failure, and multi-system involvement (cardiomegaly, anemia) align with mitochondrial disorders, though less specific than Rett Syndrome.
3. Cockayne Syndrome: Progressive neurodegeneration, growth failure, severe skeletal abnormalities (scoliosis), and characteristic facial features are similar to Cockayne Syndrome.
4. Leigh Syndrome: Neurodegeneration, movement disorders, encephalopathy, and scoliosis are seen in Leigh Syndrome but the onset with postnatal microcephaly favors Rett Syndrome more.
5. Joubert Syndrome: Intellectual disability, hypotonia, and other neurological findings fit but the specific radiological findings were not noted.
6. Angelman Syndrome: Intellectual disability and motor regression are noted in Angelman Syndrome but other hallmark features like frequent laughter, hyperactivity, and epilepsy are absent.
7. Ataxia-Telangiectasia: The neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, and ataxia fit but telangiectasia and specific radiological findings like cerebellar atrophy were not specified.
8. Krabbe Disease: Neurodegeneration and spasticity fit Krabbe Disease, but specific demyelinating features on MRI were not stated.
9. Aicardi Syndrome: Corpus callosum abnormalities and intellectual disability are noted, but typical eye abnormalities (chorioretinal lacunae) were absent.
10.

### INPUT:
A well-appearing 14-month-old girl was referred for the evaluation of recurrent left subconjunctival hemorrhage with increasing frequency since 7 months of age. Multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists during which eyes were dilated showed normal results. Clinical examination revealed 180° of left interior subconjunctival hemorrhage with overlying conjunctival elevation and mild fullness of the left lower eyelid (Figure 1A). Fixation was central, steady, and maintained bilaterally, with full ocular motility and absence of appreciable proptosis. Penlight anterior segment examination demonstrated normally formed anterior segment structures without inflammation or hyphema in either eye, although the left eye exhibited a small intraocular lightly pigmented lesion at the 5-o'clock limbus. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) was deemed appropriate and further demonstrated normal intraocular pressures bilaterally. Handheld slitlamp examination localized the left eye 2-mm limbal lesion on the posterior corneal surface. The surrounding corneal and iris structures were normal appearing without evidence of vascularization. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was used to further evaluate both the intraocular lesion and better characterize the left lower eyelid fullness. This demonstrated no iris, angle, or ciliary body involvement by the intraocular lesion. A 10-MHz contact B-scan examination showed a large inferior orbital lesion measuring more than 17 mm in the anterior-to-posterior dimension (Figure 1B). Doppler ultrasonography did not demonstrate significant flow to suggest a vascular cause. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Metastatic neuroblastoma,"Based on the provided case information, let's develop a differential diagnosis step by step, followed by a final ranking of the hypotheses.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Orbital Tumor** - Given the large inferior orbital lesion seen on B-scan, an orbital tumor could be a primary consideration.
2. **Capillary Hemangioma** - Despite the lack of significant flow on Doppler ultrasonography, capillary hemangiomas are common in children and can sometimes present without typical Doppler findings.
3. **Lymphangioma** - Orbital lymphangiomas can present with similar features and often have a mixed solid and cystic appearance.
4. **Dermoid Cyst** - Dermoid cysts are commonly seen in the orbit of young children and can present with a mass effect.
5. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - This aggressive malignancy must be considered in any rapidly growing orbital mass in a child.
6. **Sturge-Weber Syndrome** - Though less likely due to lack of skin findings, it should be considered given the ocular involvement and possible vascular malformations.
7. **Neurofibroma** - Neurofibromas can present with orbital involvement and might be considered if there is a family history of neurofibromatosis.
8. **Inflammatory Pseudotumor** - An inflammatory lesion could exist even in the absence of significant symptoms or Doppler flow.
9. **Retinoblastoma** - Typically involves the retina, but advanced cases could present with orbital extension.
10. **Hamartoma** - Often involves multiple tissue types and can be observed in the orbit.

### Final Ranking Based on All Information and Test Results

1. **Orbital Tumor** - Given the size and position of the lesion in the orbit, this remains a top differential.
2. **Lymphangioma** - The characteristics and lack of significant Doppler flow make this a strong contender.
3. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - Rapidly growing and potentially presenting as a large mass in a child.
4. **Capillary Hemangioma** - Common in children even though Doppler findings were not typical.
5. **Dermoid Cyst** - Given its frequency in pediatric orbital masses, it remains a strong possibility.
6. **Neurofibroma** - Less likely without family history but still a possibility in young children.
7. **Hamartoma** - Given the description, it could fit the presentation.
8. **Retinoblastoma** - Retinal involvement is generally primary, but extension can occur.
9. **Inflammatory Pseudotumor** - Should be considered even though less likely due to age and presentation.
10. **Sturge-Weber Syndrome** - The lack of systemic findings makes this less likely.

### INPUT:
A 27-year-old woman with history of heroin use presented with syncope. She was standing and laying out a blanket for her dog before passing out. She denied prodromal symptoms and reported this was her first syncopal episode. She reported a few episodes of dizziness in the couple days prior to presentation but denied chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or the recent use of illicit drugs or new medications. Shortly after arrival at the emergency department, she had a 50-second run of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Her vital signs and the results of her physical examination were normal. Troponin levels, thyroid levels, and the results of a complete blood cell count and metabolic panel were all normal. The results of imaging studies, including echocardiography, computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography, and brain CT, were also unremarkable. Coronary angiography found no evidence of obstructive coronary disease. The results of the urine toxicology test were negative. An initial electrocardiogram (ECG) at presentation was reviewed (Figure). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Drug-induced QT prolongation,"Based on the provided patient information and clinical data, we can develop a stepwise differential diagnosis.

1. **Long QT Syndrome (LQTS)** - Given the polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (Torsades de Pointes) and history of syncope without prodromal symptoms, Long QT Syndrome is a significant consideration.
2. **Brugada Syndrome** - This is another channelopathy that can result in syncope and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, often presenting in young adults.
3. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)** - A possibility in young patients with ventricular arrhythmias, though echocardiography was normal.
4. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)** - Can cause syncope and arrhythmias even if the ejection fraction is preserved and echocardiogram findings are subtle.
5. **Primary Cardiac Electrical Disease (e.g., catecholaminergic polymorphic VT)** - Episodes of ventricular tachycardia without structural heart disease.
6. **Electrolyte Imbalances (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia)** - Could cause ventricular arrhythmias, although basic metabolic panel was normal.
7. **Substance-Induced Arrhythmias** - Despite negative toxicology, some substances may not be detected on standard screens or may have already been metabolized.
8. **Ischemic Heart Disease** - Despite the absence of obstructive coronary disease, ischemia can occasionally present without clear angiographic evidence.
9. **Neurological Causes (e.g., seizure)** - Initial syncopal episode needs to rule out non-cardiac causes such as a seizure, despite normal brain CT.
10. **Vasovagal Syncope** - Common cause of syncope; however, presence of ventricular arrhythmia makes this less likely but still consider in differential.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Long QT Syndrome (LQTS)** - Fits best with documented arrhythmia, syncopal episodes, and lack of structural heart disease.
2. **Brugada Syndrome** - Considerable due to episodic nature of VT and negative structural findings.
3. **Primary Cardiac Electrical Disease** - Young patient with ventricular arrhythmia, no structural heart disease.
4. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)** - Could be an explanation if subtle structural heart disease is missed on initial evaluation.
5. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)** - Possible although less likely due to normal echocardiogram.
6. **Ischemic Heart Disease** - Despite normal angiogram, microvascular or spasm could be speculative causes.
7. **Substance-Induced Arrhythmias** - Negative toxicology decreases probability.
8. **Electrolyte Imbalances** - Normal metabolic panel decreases probability.
9. **Neurological Causes (e.g., seizure)** - Less likely with documented VT, but worth consideration given syncope.
10. **Vasovagal Syncope** - Least likely given the presence of a significant arrhythmia.","['Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Adverse Drug Events', 'Rhythm Disorders', 'Cardiology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,27.0,F

### INPUT:
A 7-year-old African American girl without significant medical history presented with progressive painless right-sided neck swelling for 2 months. Initially, she experienced fever and sore throat. Physical examination findings demonstrated minimally tender and nonmobile 4-cm right submandibular space swelling. Laboratory examination findings were significant for leukocytosis with neutrophilia (white blood cell count, 19.8 K/μL; neutrophil count, 18.2 K/μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]), anemia (hemoglobin level, 9.6 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (>130 mm/h), and elevated C-reactive protein level (3.1 mg/dL [to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10]). Ultrasonography revealed multiple enlarged hyperemic lymph nodes within the right side of the neck, the largest measuring 3.4 × 2.4 × 2.1 cm in the submandibular space. She was treated with oral antibiotics without improvement. Ultrasonography at 1-month follow-up revealed interval enlargement of the lymph nodes, which appeared rounded in shape, without preservation of internal architecture. The mother reported that the patient lost 3.2 kg in 2 months, without any chills or night sweats, difficulty swallowing or breathing, change in voice, abdominal pain, recent travel, or exposure to animals or pets. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated extensive unilateral right-sided neck adenopathy, the largest nodes measuring approximately 4 cm at level IB; an approximately 2-cm destructive mass involving the left maxillary malar eminence; and additional lesions involving the T4 vertebra and upper sternum (Figure, A and B). Fluorodeoxyglucose 18F-labeled positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) demonstrated extensive FDG-avid right-sided cervical lymphadenopathy and innumerable FDG-avid lytic foci involving the axial and appendicular skeleton (Figure, C).

4. **Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease**
   - Considered due to cervical lymphadenopathy and symptoms of fever. 
   
5. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Can present with lymphadenopathy and abnormal imaging findings; however, less common in children.
   
6. **Metastatic Neuroblastoma**
   - Pediatric malignancy that can present with bone marrow involvement and lymph node enlargement.
   
7. **Bacterial Lymphadenitis**
   - Initial context of fever and sore throat, though less likely given lack of response to antibiotics and extensive systemic involvement.
   
8. **Toxoplasmosis**
   - Parasitic infection presenting with lymphadenopathy; especially if the patient had potential underreported exposure to pets.
   
9. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
   - Uncommon in children but can present with multisystem involvement and lymphadenopathy.
   
10. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH)**
    - Rare disorder that can cause bone lesions and lymphadenopathy.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Lymphoma**
   - Given the progressive nature, significant weight loss, non-responsive to antibiotics, and specific imaging features.
   
2. **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)**
   - Due to elevated WBC, anemia, extensive skeletal involvement, and FDG-avid lesions.
   
3. **Metastatic Neuroblastoma**
   - Appearance of destructive bone lesions and systemic imaging findings supports this consideration.
   
4. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH)**
   - Considered due to multiple lytic bone lesions and adenopathy; more rare but fits some presenting features. 
   
5. **Tuberculosis (TB) Lymphadenitis**
   - Persistent lymphadenopathy and initial infection-like symptoms maintain this differential but less likely due to imaging results.
   
6. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Multisystem involvement and lymphadenopathy, though less common in pediatric populations.
   
7. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
   - Still considered due to potential multisystem involvement but less likely with normal renal function and no other clear lupus features.
   
8. **Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease**
   - Unlikely due to lack of improvement and more characteristic imaging and systemic presentation of lymphomas or ALL.
   
9. **Toxoplasmosis**
   - Decreased in likelihood without exposure history and specific serological tests not supporting it.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR)** - Chronic sore throat and hoarseness can be symptoms of LPR.
  
2. **Allergic Rhinitis** - Recurrent sore throat and hoarseness may be secondary to postnasal drip from allergies.

3. **Chronic Sinusitis** - Chronic infections or inflammation in the sinuses can cause recurrent sore throat and postnasal drip leading to hoarseness.

4. **Vocal Cord Nodules/Polyps** - Recurrent hoarseness could be due to nodules or polyps on the vocal cords.

5. **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)** - EBV can cause chronic sore throat and other systemic symptoms.

6. **Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)** - Chronic sore throat and susceptibility to infections may be seen in immunocompromised patients.

7. **Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (TB)** - Chronic and recurrent throat issues and lymphadenopathy could suggest TB.

8. **Human Papillomavirus (HPV)** - HPV infection can cause recurrent laryngeal symptoms including hoarseness and sore throat.

9. **Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis** - Chronic aphthous ulcers in the throat can lead to prolonged sore throat.

10. **Relapsing Polychondritis** - Involves the recurrent inflammation of cartilage, including the ears, and could explain both the sore throat and ear symptoms.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Relapsing Polychondritis** - Due to recurrent swelling and redness of the ear in addition to the sore throat and hoarseness.
2. **Chronic Sinusitis** - Could explain recurrent sore throat and hoarseness.
3. **Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR)** - Common cause of chronic sore throat and hoarseness.
4. **Vocal Cord Nodules/Polyps** - Often present in patients with chronic hoarseness.
5. **Human Papillomavirus (HPV)** - Can cause recurrent laryngeal symptoms.
6. **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)** - Should be considered in chronic sore throat cases.
7. **Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (TB)** - Chronic and recurrent throat issues plus systemic symptoms may suggest TB.
8. **Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)** - less likely without more indicators of immunocompromised status.
9. **Allergic Rhinitis** - Possible postnasal drip can cause recurrent throat symptoms.
10. **Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis** - Chronic ulcers causing sore throat.

### INPUT:
The patient is a 48-year-old man with a history of a rectal adenocarcinoma (cT3N2bM0) diagnosed 9 years prior. Following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, low anterior resection, and 6 cycles of adjuvant FOLFOX therapy (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin), he had developed a lung metastasis (KRAS wild type) 1 year later. He subsequently developed multiple lung metastases treated with palliative local interventions (lobectomy, radiofrequency ablation) and 4 lines of chemotherapy. Owing to symptomatic lung disease, he was enrolled in a clinical trial (NCT03502733) following informed consent and achieved a confirmed partial response. After 9 months, contrast computed tomography restaging scans noted a new, 1-cm posterior subglottic lesion of unclear origin (Figure, A). He had no shortness of breath or noisy breathing, dysphagia, voice change, or hemoptysis. A partial response was maintained without evidence of progression of lung disease. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma,"Sure, let's proceed with a differential diagnosis in a step-by-step manner using the given patient information:

1. **Metastatic Spread from Rectal Adenocarcinoma**: Given the patient's history of rectal adenocarcinoma and previous metastases to the lung, it is reasonable to consider the possibility of metastatic spread.

2. **Primary Tracheal Tumor**: A new lesion in the subglottic area could suggest a primary neoplasm arising from the trachea or subglottic region.

3. **Granulomatous Disease**: Conditions like sarcoidosis or tuberculosis could also present with isolated lesions in the respiratory tract.

4. **Benign Subglottic Lesion**: Benign lesions such as subglottic stenosis, papillomatosis, or a benign tumor like a hemangioma.

5. **Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP)**: RRP can cause lesions in the airway, including subglottic space.

6. **Inflammatory Pseudotumor**: Inflammatory pseudotumors can present with masses that mimic malignant lesions on imaging.

7. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Trachea**: This is a potential primary malignancy of the trachea and might present as a subglottic lesion.

8. **Tracheal Amyloidosis**: Localized amyloidosis can produce mass effects in the trachea or subglottis.

9. **Infectious Etiology**: Fungal infections such as aspergillosis might present with airway lesions.

10. **Radiation-Induced Changes**: Considering the patient's history of radiotherapy, radiation-induced fibrosis or other changes could present similarly on imaging.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses Using All Patient Information and Tests:
1. **Metastatic Spread from Rectal Adenocarcinoma**: Given his history of metastatic rectal cancer and lesion location, this remains the most likely diagnosis.
2. **Primary Tracheal Tumor**: New primary malignancies could occur independently of the patient's history of rectal adenocarcinoma.
3. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Trachea**: Considering the lesion’s location, this primary tracheal malignancy must be considered.
4. **Benign Subglottic Lesion**: Although less probable due to the patient’s oncologic history, it remains an important differential.
5. **Radiation-Induced Changes**: Previous treatments could lead to changes mimicking new lesions.
6. **Granulomatous Disease**: Less likely but notable given the non-specific presentation.
7. **Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP)**: Important to consider, especially if immunosuppressed.
8. **Inflammatory Pseudotumor**: Possible but less likely in the setting of this patient's history.
9. **Infectious Etiology**: Unlikely due to lack of symptoms suggestive of infection.
10. **Tracheal Amyloidosis**: Rare, especially with the patient's extensive oncologic history.

### INPUT:
A 69-year-old woman returning from a vacation in Cuba was brought to the emergency department directly from the airport. Her medical history was unremarkable, and she had no allergies. She had been well until 2 hours before the flight home, when at the Havana airport, she developed generalized weakness, increased sweating, severe nausea, and vomiting. In flight, she had lethargy, vomiting, and urinary incontinence. On arrival to the emergency department, she was stuporous and required intubation. Initial laboratory tests showed a hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dL (reference range, 12.0-15.2 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10.0]), a creatinine level of 1.31 mg/dL (reference range, 0.51-1.08 [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4]), and a pH of 7.22 with a normal anion gap. Serum electrolyte levels; a white blood cell count; levels of glucose, creatine kinase, lactic acid, and thyrotropin; coagulation studies; and liver function tests had normal results. An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia at 53 bpm and borderline QT interval prolongation (QTc; 465 milliseconds). A urine toxicology screen had negative results for acetaminophen, salicylates, opiates, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, and ethanol. Cerebrospinal fluid was clear, with normal levels of glucose, total protein, and white blood cells and negative microbiology and cytology testing results. A malaria smear and antigen test, respiratory viral assay, and cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine had negative results. Computed tomography of the head showed bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi (Figure 1). Within several hours, her level of consciousness improved spontaneously, and she was extubated. Her blood pressure was 99/61 mm Hg; pulse, 80 bpm; temperature, 37.6 °C; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. The patient was alert but disoriented. The pupils were 2 mm and reactive. Involuntary facial muscle twitching was noted. Her muscle tone was normal, and she had mild proximal muscle weakness with occasional bilateral upper extremity and lower extremity fasciculations and jerky movements. Deep tendon reflexes were normal, with flexor plantar responses. Her sensations to pain and vibration were normal.

    ",Organophosphate poisoning,"Let's develop a 10-step differential diagnosis process based on the given patient's presentation and medical history:

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Acute Poisoning with Carbon Monoxide (CO)**
   - Rationale: Bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi could suggest CO poisoning, common in defects of mitochondrial metabolism.
   
2. **Mitochondrial Encephalopathy**
   - Rationale: Symptoms such as stupor, muscle weakness, and brain imaging findings may be consistent with mitochondrial disorders.
   
3. **Acute Hyperammonemia**
   - Rationale: This condition could present with altered mental status and hepatic encephalopathy, though liver function tests are normal.
   
4. **Cerebral Hypoxia**
   - Rationale: Symptoms could be due to acute hypoxic events, though there’s no direct evidence of hypoxia from the presentation or test results.
   
5. **Organophosphate Poisoning**
   - Rationale: The patient's sudden onset of symptoms and exposure history could suggest organophosphate exposure, which could cause cholinergic toxicity.
   
6. **Toxin Exposure (e.g., from seafood)**
   - Rationale: Consumption of unsafe food or water during travel may lead to neurotoxic effects, although specific toxin evidence is lacking.
   
7. **Brain Neoplasm**
   - Rationale: CNS symptoms and imaging might correspond to a tumor, particularly if the tumor affects deep brain structures like globus pallidus.
   
8. **Metabolic Encephalopathy**
   - Rationale: Severe metabolic disturbances can result in altered mental status and weakness, though initial labs are unremarkable.
   
9. **Non-Convulsive Status Epilepticus**
   - Rationale: Could potentially lead to altered mental status and abnormal movements with normal neuroimaging studies.
   
10. **Acute Stroke**
   - Rationale: Could cause sudden neurological deficits, but imaging findings and the patient’s rapid spontaneous recovery make stroke less likely.

### Re-ranking Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Acute Poisoning with Carbon Monoxide (CO)**
   - CO poisoning is supported by the bilateral globus pallidi hyperdensity, a common finding in CO intoxication.
   
2. **Organophosphate Poisoning**
   - Sudden onset of symptoms including sweating, weakness, and urinary incontinence is suggestive of a cholinergic crisis.
   
3. **Toxin Exposure (e.g., from seafood)**
   - Travel history and acute GI and CNS symptoms could indicate neurotoxin exposure from food.
   
4. **Mitochondrial Encephalopathy**
   - Based on the brain imaging and neuro symptoms, less likely compared to CO poisoning but still reasonable.
   
5. **Metabolic Encephalopathy**
   - The presentation is consistent with metabolic disturbances leading to stupor, though labs are inconclusive.
   
6. **Acute Hyperammonemia**
   - Despite normal liver function, ammonia could rise due to other factors (e.g., infections, medications).
   
7. **Cerebral Hypoxia**
   - The presentation somewhat fits but without a clear hypoxic event, it's less likely.
   
8. **Brain Neoplasm**
   - Imaging findings of hyperdensity are more characteristic of other causes than neoplasm, particularly considering the acute onset.
   
9. **Non-Convulsive Status Epilepticus**
   - Given the normal electrographic data and improvement, status epilepticus becomes less probable.
   
10. **Acute Stroke**
   - MRI and CT scans would typically show evidence if this was the cause, making it the least likely in this context.

By going through step-by-step evaluation and re-ranking based on test results and thorough consideration, acute poisoning with carbon monoxide (CO) remains the most likely diagnosis.","['Emergency Medicine', 'Global Health', 'Toxicology', 'Neurology', 'Geriatrics']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,69.0,F

### INPUT:
A 9-year-old, vaccinated boy with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and β-thalassemia trait presented with 1 month of progressive dyspnea, snoring, dysphagia, and weight loss. Both parents had a history of latent tuberculosis infection treated after immigrating to the US from Syria shortly after the patient’s birth. The patient’s pediatrician diagnosed him with reactive airway disease and adenotonsillar hypertrophy. He was referred to the otolaryngology clinic, where flexible laryngoscopy revealed diffuse upper airway lymphoid hyperplasia and supraglottic edema. He was sent to the emergency department, where he was stridulous and afebrile with a normal white blood cell count and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A computed tomography scan of the neck revealed diffuse edema and contrast enhancement of the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and supraglottis. A chest radiograph was normal. The patient was taken urgently to the operating room for direct microlaryngoscopy (Figure 1A and B) and intubated. Results of biopsies and cultures of the tonsils, adenoids, and supraglottis revealed diffuse non-necrotizing granulomas (Figure 1C) and oropharyngeal flora with negative acid-fast bacilli and Grocott methenamine silver stains. He remained intubated, and treatment with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics was initiated. During this time, he had a normal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level and normal titers for antinuclear antibody (ANA), cytoplasmic antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, antimyeloperoxidase antibody, antiproteinase 3 antibody, anti–double-stranded DNA antibody, Smith antibody, Sjogren antibodies, and histoplasma antibodies. He also had normal results on tuberculin purified protein derivative and interferon-γ release assay (QuantiFERON; Qiagen).

    ",Sarcoidosis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis for the 9-Year-Old Boy

1. **Sarcoidosis**
2. **Wegener’s Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)** 
3. **Epiglottitis**
4. **Primary Immunodeficiency** 
5. **Lymphoma**

7. **Foreign Body Aspiration**
8. **Viral Infection (e.g., Epstein-Barr Virus)**
9. **Autoimmune Disease (Other than those already tested)**
10. **Subglottic Stenosis**

### Re-ranking Differential Diagnoses Based on All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Sarcoidosis** - Consistent with non-necrotizing granulomas and systemic presentation.
2. **Primary Immunodeficiency** - Fits with the chronic nature of symptoms and potential for unusual infection manifestations.
3. **Lymphoma** - Given infiltration pattern noted on biopsy and diffuse lymphoid hyperplasia.
4. **Viral Infection (e.g., Epstein-Barr Virus)** - Chronic symptoms could align with viral etiology, and latent viruses could cause granulomas.
5. **Epiglottitis** - Supraglottic edema, though typically more acute.
6. **Fungal Infection (e.g., Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis)** - Though Grocott methenamine silver stains were negative, certain fungal infections can cause granulomas.
7. **Subglottic Stenosis** - May align with respiratory symptoms, though structural changes on imaging would be expected.
8. **Autoimmune Disease (Other than those already tested)** - Some rare autoimmune conditions could present similarly.
9. **Wegener’s Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)** - Less likely given negative specific antibody tests.
10. **Foreign Body Aspiration** - Unlikely given the chronicity and presentation across multiple upper airway sites.

### Summary of Final Diagnosis
Based on the findings of diffuse non-necrotizing granulomas, normal chest radiograph, and absence of infectious organism detection, the highest in the differential is **Sarcoidosis**, followed by consideration of **Primary Immunodeficiency** or **Lymphoma**. Further diagnostic tests, such as advanced imaging, possible PET scan, and additional biopsy tests, would be warranted to confirm the diagnosis.","['Laryngology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine', 'Otolaryngology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9.0,M

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old White man presented with a 15-year history of dull midline lower back pain associated with bilateral hip pain. He also noted bilateral hand pain along the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints and prolonged morning stiffness lasting approximately 45 minutes. Family history was notable for a brother with osteoarthritis, hypogonadism, and type 2 diabetes. Vital signs were within normal limits (heart rate, 92/min; blood pressure, 136/84 mm Hg; respiratory rate,  16/min; oxygen saturation, 97%; temperature, 37.0 °C). Musculoskeletal examination revealed swelling of the second, third, and fifth MCP joints and second and third PIP joints bilaterally as well as decreased knee and hip range of motion with minimal knee effusions. Lower back flexion was decreased with only 4-mm excursion on the modified Schober test. Results of cardiopulmonary, abdominal, neurologic, and dermatologic examinations were unremarkable. Results of laboratory testing, including complete blood cell count, basic metabolic panel, and liver function tests, were within normal limits, and results for HLA-B27 were negative. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 8 mm/h and C-reactive protein level was 0.5 mg/dL. A plain radiograph of the hands (Figure, left panel) showed hook-like osteophytes at the second and third MCP joints bilaterally as well as asymmetric joint swelling in multiple MCP and PIP joints. A plain radiograph of the pelvis (Figure, right panel) showed sclerosis and joint narrowing at both sacroiliac joints as well as joint narrowing and osteophytes in the hip joints bilaterally.

6. **Reactive arthritis**
7. **Hemochromatosis**
8. **Systemic lupus erythematosus**
9. **Fibromyalgia**
10. **Polymyalgia rheumatica**

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Hemochromatosis** - The presence of hook-like osteophytes at MCP joints, prolonged morning stiffness, and joint involvement pattern, along with family history of hypogonadism and type 2 diabetes, point towards hemochromatosis.
2. **Osteoarthritis** - Joint narrowing and osteophytes in the hands and hips are classical features, although the extent of systemic involvement and morning stiffness are less typical.
3. **Psoriatic arthritis** - Joint involvement pattern and radiographic findings may mimic this, even though the absence of skin lesions is notable.
4. **Rheumatoid arthritis** - Symmetric joint involvement and morning stiffness are suggestive, however, the lack of significant inflammatory markers and presence of specific radiographic features makes it less likely.
5. **Ankylosing spondylitis** - Decreased lumbar flexion and sacroiliac involvement are suggestive, but the patient is HLA-B27 negative, which reduces likelihood.
6. **Reactive arthritis** - Considered because of joint involvement, but lacks a preceding infection or significant gastrointestinal/genitourinary symptoms.
7. **Gout** - Involvement of MCP and PIP joints with joint swelling could suggest it, but this typically has acute and intense episodes and is less likely given chronicity.
8. **Polymyalgia rheumatica** - Usually associated with elevated inflammatory markers and more common in older adults.
9. **Systemic lupus erythematosus** - Can involve multiple organ systems with joint pain and stiffness, but the absence of other systemic findings lowers probability.
10. **Fibromyalgia** - Chronic pain and stiffness are present, but the pattern of joint involvement and radiographic changes are not typical for fibromyalgia.","['Osteoarthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Radiology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,44.0,M

### INPUT:
A 19-year-old White woman who was previously in good health, with no reported history of drug abuse, presented with progressive bilateral nasal airway obstruction, crusting, and saddle nose deformity over a 6-month period. The patient denied systemic symptoms, including oral ulcers, sicca, photosensitivity, dermatitis, or arthralgias. Her medical history had negative results for allergic rhinitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, epistaxis, nasal trauma, or surgery. Her family history was noncontributory. An in-office nasal endoscopy demonstrated synechiae bridging from the septum to the lateral nasal walls, polypoid changes, and yellow crusting bilaterally. Her immune workup showed elevated complement C3 (200 mg/dL) and total hemolytic complement (CH50; >60 U/mL) levels, with otherwise unremarkable levels of C4, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor, Sjögren antibodies, angiotensin-converting enzyme, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, bullous pemphigoid IgG antibodies, and quantitative immunoglobulins and IgG subclasses (IgG4, 53 mg/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 0.01]). Nasal cultures had positive results for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides. Preoperative computed tomography showed no evidence of paranasal mucosal disease or bone erosion. An operative endoscopy with elevation of the mucoperichondrial flaps revealed an absence of the quadrangular cartilage caudal struts and irregular, friable tissue along the cartilage and perichondrium. Surgical pathology examination demonstrated prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate (Figure, A), angiocentric fibrosis with a relative lack of eosinophils (Figure, B), and increased IgG4 absolute count (up to 50 cells per high-power field), although an IgG4-IgG ratio that was only slightly elevated (0.2) (Figure, C and D).

8. **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**
9. **Chronic granulomatous disease**
10. **Nasal lymphoma**

### Reranking Based on All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **IgG4-related disease**: Elevated IgG4 count and angiocentric fibrosis with a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate support this diagnosis.
2. **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA)**: The nasal symptoms and the non-contributory ANCA might place this diagnosis lower despite clinical symptoms suggestive of vasculitis.
3. **Relapsing polychondritis**: Saddle nose deformity is classic, but lack of other systemic features makes it less likely.
4. **Sarcoidosis**: Less likely given the absence of systemic symptoms and negative ACE levels.
5. **Wegener’s granulomatosis**: Difference in specific pathologic findings and absence of widespread systemic involvement.
6. **Churg-Strauss Syndrome**: Relatively improbable due to lack of eosinophilic infiltrates and other classic systemic manifestations.
7. **Nasal lymphoma**: Considered due to the infiltrative nature but less likely compared to IgG4-RD given histological findings.
8. **Infectious granulomatous disease (e.g., Tuberculosis)**: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides presence points to infection but not the primary etiological agent for such systemic manifestations.
9. **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: Negative for ANA and other supporting labs.
10. **Chronic granulomatous disease**: Different disease profile and younger typical onset compared to this patient’s presentation.","['Facial Plastic Surgery', 'Otolaryngology', 'Head and Neck Reconstruction', 'Rhinology and Sinus Disease', 'Head and Neck Surgery']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,F

### INPUT:
A girl younger than 2 years presented with a 7-month history of an inflammatory plaque on her left index finger (Figure, A). This lesion had started as a light erythema a few months before, initially oriented as a bacterial paronychia or herpetic whitlow and treated with an oral antibiotic (amoxicillin) and antiviral (acyclovir) without improvement. There was no relevant medical history. The family reported living in a rural area on the Mediterranean coast. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cutaneous leishmaniasis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Mycobacterial Infection** 
   - **Reasoning:** Chronic inflammatory lesions, especially in children, often prompt consideration of atypical mycobacterial infections like Mycobacterium marinum, particularly with exposure to environments like the Mediterranean coast.
  
2. **Fungal Infection (e.g., Sporotrichosis)**
   - **Reasoning:** Chronic and non-responsive to antibiotics, cutaneous lesions can be seen in fungal infections, especially Sporotrichosis found in rural areas due to plant material exposure.
  
3. **Psoriasis**
   - **Reasoning:** Chronic inflammatory plaques can sometimes be mistaken for infections. Given the chronic nature, psoriatic lesions could be considered.

4. **Contact Dermatitis**
   - **Reasoning:** Exposure to allergens or irritants could cause chronic inflammatory skin reactions, especially living in a rural area with various potential allergens.

5. **Lichen Planus**
   - **Reasoning:** Chronic inflammatory conditions involving mucocutaneous sites can present as plaques and could be confused with infectious causes in children.

6. **Juvenile Xanthogranuloma**
   - **Reasoning:** This is a benign condition common in infants and young children that can present with chronic skin lesions.

7. **Hemangioma**
   - **Reasoning:** They are common benign vascular tumors that can sometimes mimic infections or inflammatory conditions due to their appearance and prolonged course.

8. **Sarcoidosis**
   - **Reasoning:** Though less common in very young children, chronic inflammatory skin lesions can sometimes be early manifestations of systemic conditions like sarcoidosis.

9. **Granuloma Annulare**
   - **Reasoning:** Chronic granulomatous disorders present with persistent plaques and nodules and might be considered in a differential for chronic inflammatory skin conditions.

10. **Foreign Body Reaction**
    - **Reasoning:** Chronic inflammation could result from an unnoticed foreign body embedded in the skin, particularly in children who play actively and might have sustained unnoticed trauma.

### Reranking of Differential Diagnoses:

Based on the presentation, characteristic lesion appearance, lack of response to antibiotics and antivirals, living in a rural area, and previous exposures, the differential diagnoses can be prioritized as follows:

1. **Mycobacterial Infection** - Given the history of living in a coastal rural area, there is a high chance of exposure.
2. **Sporotrichosis (Fungal Infection)** - Similar reasoning, along with the typical presentation of non-respondent cutaneous lesions.
3. **Foreign Body Reaction** - Chronic localized inflammation could indicate an unnoticed foreign material.
4. **Contact Dermatitis** - Consistency with exposure to various potential allergens in rural settings.
5. **Granuloma Annulare** - Common in children and fits the description of persistent inflammatory plaque.
6. **Juvenile Xanthogranuloma** - It's a benign condition common in this age group with similar presenting lesions.
7. **Psoriasis** - Consideration due to chronic and inflammatory nature.
8. **Lichen Planus** - Although less common, it’s a condition presenting with chronic inflammation.
9. **Hemangioma** - Would have been more apparent earlier due to its vascular nature.
10. **Sarcoidosis** - Least likely given the patient's age and isolated presentation, but cannot be entirely ruled out without further systemic evaluation.

This merged differential list considers the chronicity, exposure, lack of response to initial treatments, and environmental context for a more comprehensive and prioritized diagnostic approach.","['Infectious Diseases', 'Pediatrics', 'Nail Disorders', 'Dermatology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1.0,F

### INPUT:
A 71-year-old man with no history of smoking was referred to our tertiary center in August 2018 for an asymptomatic left level 5 neck mass that had been present for 6 months. Biopsy of the mass demonstrated metastatic p16-positive (human papillomavirus [HPV]-related) squamous cell carcinoma. Examination revealed a large left base of tongue mass filling the vallecula. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated an enhancing mass within the left base of tongue and bilateral cervical adenopathy. The patient was treated with concurrent radiation therapy and cetuximab, completing treatment without breaks in November 2018. His 3-month posttreatment fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT) imaging results demonstrated resolution of the activity at the base of tongue mass and the involved cervical lymph nodes, consistent with complete treatment response. In July 2019, the patient presented with a palpable left supraclavicular lymph node. Restaging FDG-PET/CT demonstrated avid supraclavicular and anterolateral neck adenopathy. Additionally, there was moderately intense activity isolated to the left thyroid lobe. Ultrasonography of the thyroid demonstrated a 4-cm mass within the gland, and subsequent biopsy was performed with immunohistochemistry staining positive for p16, CK5, and p40 and negative for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) (Figure, A, B). After multidisciplinary review of the case, the patient was offered salvage left modified radical neck dissection and total thyroidectomy. Surgical pathology confirmed the diagnosis (Figure, C). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma,"Let's go through a 10-step differential diagnosis process for this patient.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis
1. **Metastatic HPV-related Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**
   - Initial biopsy demonstrated metastatic p16-positive squamous cell carcinoma.

2. **Thyroid Cancer**
   - There is moderately intense activity isolated to the left thyroid lobe shown on FDG-PET/CT, raising suspicion for primary thyroid malignancy.

3. **Recurrent HPV-related Oropharyngeal SCC**
   - Given the history of HPV-related SCC and recurrence of adenopathy suggest possible recurrence at a distant site.

4. **Lymphoma**
   - The presence of supraclavicular lymphadenopathy could suggest a lymphoproliferative disorder such as lymphoma.

5. **Metastatic Cancer of Unknown Primary**
   - Metastases could originate from an unidentified primary site.

6. **Thymic Carcinoma**
   - Given the anterolateral neck adenopathy, a thymic origin could be considered, though less likely due to p16 positivity.

7. **Metastatic Lung Cancer**
   - Despite being less likely due to the negative TTF-1 staining, lung cancer remains in consideration, typically requiring exclusion.

8. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Although less common, granulomatous disease such as sarcoidosis can present with lymphadenopathy.

9. **Infectious Etiology**
   - Infectious causes of lymphadenopathy should be ruled out even though they are less likely due to the patient's oncologic history.

10. **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)**
    - CLL is another potential cause of lymphadenopathy but with distinct clinical features.

### Reranking All Differential Diagnoses Using Complete Information
1. **Recurrent HPV-related Oropharyngeal SCC**
   - Strongly suggested by p16 positivity, CK5, and p40 positive staining on biopsy.
   
2. **Metastatic HPV-related Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**
   - Initially diagnosed and fits the pattern of disease recurrence, especially with continued p16 positivity.

3. **Thyroid Cancer**
   - The isolated 4-cm mass in the thyroid lobe on FDG-PET/CT remains a consideration, but negative TTF-1 reduces its likelihood as a primary thyroid carcinoma.

4. **Metastatic Cancer of Unknown Primary**
   - Continues to be considered, especially if primary site is not conclusively determined.

5. **Lymphoma**
   - Supraclavicular and cervical adenopathy could fit lymphoma but less likely with p16 positivity.

6. **Thymic Carcinoma**
   - Less likely with negative TTF-1 and distinct pathology characteristics.

7. **Metastatic Lung Cancer**
   - Reduced likelihood with negative TTF-1 but cannot be entirely excluded without further investigation.

8. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Very unlikely given the oncologic context and biopsy results.

9. **Infectious Etiology**
   - Unlikely given clinical context and biopsy findings.

10. **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)**
    - Least likely based on the clinical and pathological picture.

### INPUT:
A 41-year-old man presented with a 7-month history of episodes of back and abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, and flushing. Immediately following workup with noncontrast abdominal ultrasonography, he experienced intense flushing and vomiting. Subsequent contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging identified a 5-cm thoracic paraspinal mass (Figure, A). Computed tomography–guided biopsy of the paraspinal mass revealed a dense cellular infiltrate on histopathology composed of cells with round nuclei and abundant pale cytoplasm (Figure, B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Mastocytoma,"Based on the given clinical presentation and workup, we can systematically approach the differential diagnosis:

1. **Pheochromocytoma** - Episodes of flushing, nausea, vomiting, and the presence of a mass suggest a neuroendocrine tumor.
2. **Paraganglioma** - A paraspinal mass could be a paraganglioma, which shares similarities with pheochromocytoma but arises outside the adrenal gland.
3. **Neuroblastoma** - Considered due to the location and histopathological findings of dense cellular infiltrate with round nuclei.
4. **Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)** - These tumors can present with abdominal pain but are less likely given the paraspinal location.
5. **Spinal Schwannoma** - Common paraspinal mass with similar imaging and histological appearances.
6. **Metastatic Carcinoma** - Potential primary cancers that metastasize to the spine, such as lung or prostate cancer.
7. **Hodgkin Lymphoma** - B symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats) often accompany lymphoma, along with mass lesions like the one described.
8. **Ewing Sarcoma** - More common in younger patients, but could still be considered due to the mass location and histological findings.
9. **Chordoma** - Rare, malignant tumors occurring along the spine, presenting with pain and a mass.
10. **Multiple Myeloma** - Characteristic bone lesions, but primarily results in plasma cell infiltrates rather than dense cellular infiltrates.

**Reranked Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Paraganglioma** - The combination of symptoms and paraspinal mass highly suggests this diagnosis.
2. **Pheochromocytoma** - Should be closely considered, especially due to the shared symptomatology.
3. **Neuroblastoma** - The paraspinal mass and histology fit; however, more common in younger patients.
4. **Spinal Schwannoma** - The mass characteristics and location are consistent with schwannomas.
5. **Hodgkin Lymphoma** - Lymphomas can present with mass lesions and systemic symptoms.
6. **Ewing Sarcoma** - While less likely due to age, the mass and histology align with possibilities for sarcoma.
7. **Chordoma** - Fits the location but less likely due to typical presentation in older adults.
8. **Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)** - Less likely given the paraspinal rather than gastrointestinal location.
9. **Metastatic Carcinoma** - Requires evaluation of a primary cancer source, making it lower on the list.
10. **Multiple Myeloma** - Can present with skeletal lesions but histopathology does not correlate well with this case.","['Allergy and Clinical Immunology', 'Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41.0,M

2. **Third Nerve Palsy**: Another potential cause of ptosis, though usually associated with other ocular motor deficits.
3. **Myasthenia Gravis**: Chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease resulting in muscle weakness including ptosis.
4. **Giant Cell Arteritis**: Given the patient's age and symptoms of pain, although it usually presents with systemic symptoms like temporal headache, jaw claudication, and elevated ESR.
5. **Cavernous Sinus Syndrome**: It can involve multiple cranial nerves causing ptosis and facial pain.
6. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome**: Rare form of painful ophthalmoplegia, which includes ptosis and retro-orbital pain.
7. **Migraine**: Can present with a variety of neurological features, including ptosis and facial pain, although usually transient.
8. **Intracranial Aneurysm**: Specifically a posterior communicating artery aneurysm potentially presenting with third nerve palsy.
9. **Carotid Artery Dissection**: Can cause Horner syndrome with ipsilateral pain and ptosis.
10. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome (Orbital Pseudotumor)**: Inflammatory condition that can cause ptosis and pain without infection.

### Reranking based on the patient's information and tests:
Given the unremarkable results from CT, MRI, and carotid duplex ultrasonography, we will prioritize functional and inflammatory causes over structural/vascular etiologies.

1. **Horner Syndrome**: Continues to be top due to specific features of ptosis and anisocoria, even though CT and MRI were unremarkable.
2. **Myasthenia Gravis**: Autoimmune neuromuscular condition fits chronicity and ptosis.
3. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome**: Consider as a less common cause of painful ophthalmoplegia; normal imaging doesn't rule it out.
4. **Third Nerve Palsy**: Despite imaging being unremarkable, perhaps due to a less evident etiology such as microvascular ischemia still possible.
5. **Giant Cell Arteritis**: Needs consideration despite normal imaging due to age and vasculitis possibility.
6. **Cavernous Sinus Syndrome**: Consideration due to multiple cranial nerve involvement, consistent with facial pain, even though initial imaging was normal.
7. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome**: Could be present with normal imaging since inflammation can be variable.
8. **Carotid Artery Dissection**: Less likely due to normal carotid imaging, but still a differential given history and physical exam findings.
9. **Migraine**: Possible but typically would not cause persistent ptosis.
10. **Intracranial Aneurysm**: Unlikely with normal imaging, but still worth consideration due to its potential severity.

This step-by-step approach helps ensure all possible differential diagnoses are evaluated in sequence, with the most relevant information guiding the final list of candidates. Further testing like specific antibody testing for Myasthenia Gravis or a trial of corticosteroids for Tolosa-Hunt syndrome might be warranted based on the final weighted differentials.","['Hypertension', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Vascular Surgery', 'External Eye Disease']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,56.0,M

### INPUT:
A 34-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of progressive, unilateral lower lip and chin numbness and ipsilateral facial fullness. The hypoesthesia was limited to the distribution of the mandibular branch of the left trigeminal nerve (V3). On review of systems, the patient denied experiencing visual changes, dizziness, headaches, oral or neck pain, voice changes, weight or appetite changes, or swallowing dysfunction; however, he did report biting his lip occasionally due to the numbness. On examination, there were no palpable masses noted in the head, neck, or face. Aside from the V3 sensory deficit, the patient had no cranial nerve deficits. The patient had no significant medical history; prior surgical history was notable for tonsillectomy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the face revealed a T1 isointense, T2 hyperintense 5.9-cm lesion in the left masticator space, which appeared to be centered in the lateral pterygoid muscle with benign-appearing remodeling of the posterior maxillary wall (Figure).

An older adult presented with a history of a mildly pruritic plaque on the elbow at the site of a prior injury. The medical history was unremarkable, and findings of a review of systems were negative. The patient had been treated in the past with topical steroids without improvement, and the size of the lesion had continued to grow slowly. Physical examination findings revealed a solitary, well-circumscribed pink plaque with overlying yellow-white micaceous scale with interspersed punctate hemorrhagic crusts (Figure, A).

### OUTPUT:
    ",Sporotrichosis,"Sure, let's develop a 10-step differential diagnosis for this clinical presentation and later rerank them using all the patient information and test results provided.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Psoriasis vulgaris**
   - A chronic autoimmune condition known for well-circumscribed plaques with silvery scale, often pruritic and can appear on elbows.

2. **Lichen simplex chronicus**
   - Characterized by lichenified plaques that result from chronic scratching and rubbing; typically presents with pruritus.

3. **Squamous cell carcinoma in situ**
   - Presents as persistent plaques in sun-exposed areas; tend to be scaly or crusted and can slowly enlarge over time.

4. **Bowen's disease**
   - A form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ that appears as a persistent red, scaly plaque, which can be misdiagnosed as psoriasis or eczema.

5. **Actinic keratosis**
   - Often presents as a scaly, crusty lesion on sun-exposed skin that can slowly enlarge.

6. **Chronic eczema (dermatitis)**
   - Characterized by persistent, pruritic, lichenified plaques that can become crusted and scaly.

7. **Tinea corporis (ringworm)**
   - A fungal infection that presents as a slowly growing, scaly, pruritic plaque, but typically has a more annular shape with active edges.

8. **Nummular eczema**
   - Presents as round or coin-shaped pruritic plaques that can have scale and crust.

9. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma**
   - Can appear as persistent, pruritic plaques that slowly enlarge and exhibit epidermotropic neoplastic T-cells on histology.

10. **Lupus erythematosus (chronic cutaneous)**
    - Can manifest as persistent plaques on sun-exposed areas, with characteristic scaling and atrophy.

### Reranking of Differential Diagnosis

After considering all the provided patient information and test results (punch biopsy revealing histopathologic sections):

1. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma**
   - Persistent plaques with histopathology might show invasive atypical lymphocytes, fitting with the slow growth and pruritic nature of the lesion.

2. **Bowen's disease**
   - Histopathology showing full thickness dysplasia of keratinocytes will be indicative, aligning with the clinical presentation.

3. **Squamous cell carcinoma in situ**
   - Similar to Bowen's disease, might show dysplasia, but needs differentiation based on biopsy.

4. **Lupus erythematosus (chronic cutaneous)**
   - Biopsy may show interface dermatitis with thickening of the basement membrane.

5. **Psoriasis vulgaris**
   - Characteristic Micaceous scale and punctate bleeding might indicate psoriasis, but histopathology will show Munro microabscesses and parakeratosis.

6. **Chronic eczema (dermatitis)**
   - Histopathology may show spongiosis, but this presents in the context of the patient's unremarkable medical history and no improvement with steroids.

7. **Lichen simplex chronicus**
   - Histology will show thickened epidermis and hyperkeratosis without atypia, less likely considering the failure to respond to steroids.

8. **Actinic keratosis**
   - Biopsy might show atypical keratinocytes only in basal layers, less likely with this persistent plaque.

9. **Nummular eczema**
   - Histology showing spongiotic dermatitis, but less likely given clinical context and steroid treatment failure.

10. **Tinea corporis (ringworm)**
    - Fungal elements would appear on biopsy, which is less likely in this scenario after evaluating the clinical description.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 64-year-old man was referred for a neuro-ophthalmological evaluation of bilateral optic nerve head edema that was noticed 2 months previously during a routine optometric examination. He denied having any symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), including headaches, pulsatile tinnitus, and transient visual obscurations. Findings on computed tomography of the brain without contrast were unremarkable. He was then seen by an ophthalmologist who confirmed bilateral severe optic nerve edema and requested magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits without contrast. It demonstrated signs of increased ICP, including empty sella, posterior flattening of the globes, and widened optic nerve sheaths, but no other abnormalities (Figure 1A). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Papilledema,"### Differential Diagnosis Development Steps:

1. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)** - Given the signs of increased ICP without other abnormalities on imaging and the lack of typical symptoms.
2. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)** - Can cause bilateral optic disc swelling, although usually presents with other retinal findings.
3. **Papilledema** - General term for optic disc swelling due to increased ICP; needs to be differentiated from other specific causes.
4. **Optic Neuritis** - Usually unilateral, but bilateral presentation can occur, often associated with multiple sclerosis or other systemic diseases.
5. **Malignant Hypertension** - Can lead to bilateral optic disc swelling, check blood pressure and renal function.
6. **Optic Disc Drusen** - Deposits in the optic nerve head, can cause similar findings on imaging but usually without increased ICP.
7. **Sarcoidosis** - Can involve the optic nerve bilaterally and may show up on MRI as optic nerve thickening.
8. **Meningioma** - Although less likely given the imaging described, can cause optic nerve compression and bilateral optic disc swelling.
9. **Vasculitis** - Autoimmune vasculitis, like giant cell arteritis, can affect the optic nerves, typically presenting with other systemic symptoms.
10. **Toxic Optic Neuropathy** - Exposure to certain toxins or medications can lead to bilateral optic nerve swelling.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses Based on Provided Information:

1. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)** - Most likely given the imaging results and unremarkable CT.
2. **Malignant Hypertension** - Needs to be ruled out with blood pressure measurement and renal function tests.
3. **Papilledema** - Broad term, but still needs specific cause identification.
4. **Optic Neuritis** - Bilateral presentation is less common but possible, especially in systemic diseases.
5. **Sarcoidosis** - Needs further systemic investigation (chest X-ray, ACE levels).
6. **Meningioma** - Imaging less suggestive but consideration of tumor causing increased ICP.
7. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)** - Needs examination of retinal findings.
8. **Optic Disc Drusen** - Usually doesn't cause increased ICP but can mimic optic disc swelling.
9. **Vasculitis** - Unlikely given lack of systemic symptoms, but still a differential.
10. **Toxic Optic Neuropathy** - Exposure history missing, but a potential differential.

Final evaluation should include a thorough history, examination, and targeted investigations to further narrow down the differential.","['Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Ophthalmic Imaging', 'Retinal Disorders']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,64.0,M

### INPUT:
A woman in her 40s presented to an outside ophthalmologist with a 3-day history of an inferior scotoma in her right eye. Her Snellen visual acuities were 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. Her intraocular pressures were 21 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS. The right eye had a relative afferent pupillary defect and mild optic nerve edema. To rule out optic neuritis, a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain and orbits was obtained; the results were unremarkable. Six days after symptom onset, her visual acuity decreased to 20/70 OD and the disc edema increased. In addition, the right eye had developed 2+ anterior chamber cell, keratic precipitates, and a possible branch vein occlusion. At this time the patient was referred to our clinic. On presentation 1 day later, visual acuity was light perception OD and still 20/20 OS. The right eye had 3+ anterior chamber cell, inferior keratic precipitates, and 1+ vitreous cell. The right optic nerve had grade 4 disc edema with flame-shaped peripapillary hemorrhages. The fundus examination results of the right eye revealed the following superior quadrant retinal findings: extensive intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages along vessels, arteriolar attenuation and sheathing, venous engorgement, and tortuosity. The inferior midperiphery had numerous small areas of deep retinal whitening (Figure 1). Examination results of the left eye were normal.

7. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**
8. **Behçet's Disease**
9. **Syphilitic Optic Neuritis**
10. **Paraneoplastic Optic Neuropathy**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)**: 
   - The presentation includes extensive intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages, venous engorgement, and tortuosity, which are classic findings.
   - Severe disc edema and flame-shaped hemorrhages further support this diagnosis.

2. **Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO)**:
   - The initial suspicion of possible branch vein occlusion supports this, but the spread of findings across more than one quadrant makes CRVO more likely.
   - The features are consistent with vascular occlusive disease, yet more widespread pathology is apparent.

3. **Uveitis**: 
   - Anterior chamber cell reaction and keratic precipitates suggest inflammatory etiology.
   - The progression of symptoms and worsening visual acuity are concerning for an inflammatory cause.

4. **Sarcoidosis**:
   - Check for any systemic symptoms or history of sarcoidosis; could explain optic nerve changes and anterior chamber reaction.
   - Examination and diagnostic testing (e.g., chest X-ray, ACE levels) would be necessary.

5. **Lupus Vasculitis**: 
   - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can present with vasculitis affecting the retinal vessels, causing similar findings.
   - Autoimmune screening would be required.

6. **Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AION)**:
   - Might consider non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy given optic disk edema.
   - The presence of severe retinal findings lowers its probability compared to above listed causes.

7. **Syphilitic Optic Neuritis**:
   - Must consider in differential due to varied presentation of syphilis.
   - Serologic testing for syphilis (RPR, VDRL) is warranted.

8. **Behçet's Disease**:
   - This systemic vasculitis can involve retinal vessels.
   - Look for other systemic signs like oral ulcers, genital ulcers, and skin lesions.

9. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**:
   - Often associated with optic neuritis; less likely given unremarkable MRI.
   - Still considered due to optic nerve involvement.

10. **Paraneoplastic Optic Neuropathy**:
    - Rare, consider if systemic symptoms, signs of malignancy, or history suggestive of a paraneoplastic syndrome.
    - Further workup with oncological screening would be required.

### Summary:

The most likely diagnosis, after thorough consideration of all clinical and investigation findings, is **Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)**, followed by **Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO)** and **Uveitis** due to the combination of retinal and optic disc changes along with anterior chamber reactions. Systemic conditions like **Sarcoidosis** and **Lupus Vasculitis** still remain plausible and should be investigated further.","['Ophthalmology', 'Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Retinal Disorders']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,40.0,F

A 75-year old woman with a history of follicular lymphoma and breast cancer presented with a 3-month history of gradual vision loss and 1-month history of confusion and difficulty with word finding. She had been diagnosed with hormone receptor–positive right breast cancer 8 years prior and underwent lumpectomy and treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, with remission since. Five years later, she subsequently developed left inguinal adenopathy, which biopsy results showed was follicular lymphoma. At that time, she was treated with a course of bendamustine and rituximab with subsequent maintenance treatment with rituximab for 2 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed, demonstrating T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity in the left occipital and temporal lobes, crossing the corpus callosum and extending into the right occipital lobe without enhancement (Figure).

Given the patient's history, presenting symptoms, and MRI findings, the differential diagnoses should be ranked considering both the likelihood based on the patient's medical history and the MRI findings. Here are the re-ranked differential diagnoses:

1. **Primary Central Nervous System (CNS) Lymphoma**: Given the patient's history of follicular lymphoma and the MRI findings suggestive of CNS involvement.
2. **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)**: Due to immunosuppression from prior treatment.
3. **Brain Metastasis from Breast Cancer**: Considering her history of breast cancer; however, imaging may not fully correlate with typical appearances of metastasis.
4. **Glioblastoma Multiforme**: MRI findings of crossing the corpus callosum are concerning for a high-grade glioma.
5. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**: Given her history of multiple malignancies, this is a possibility.
6. **Infectious Encephalitis**: Less likely but important to consider in an immunocompromised patient.
7. **Multiple Sclerosis**: Can present with similar MRI findings but atypical given her age and medical history.
8. **Vascular Dementia**: Depending on her vascular history, though MRI findings less typical of vascular etiology.
9. **Alzheimer’s Disease**: Symptoms could align with dementia but less likely given specific MRI findings.
10. **Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH)**: Given her age and symptomatology but less likely considering the MRI results.

2. **Lymphoma Cutis**
   - Elevated due to the patient’s history of hematological malignancy and stem cell transplantation.

3. **Cutaneous Metastasis**
   - Up-ranked since metastatic disease is a possibility in a cancer patient with new skin lesions.

4. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Ranked considering the granulomatous appearance of nodules, though less likely without systemic symptoms.

5. **Kaposi Sarcoma**
   - Elevated in the differential due to the presentation of nodules and plaques, though less likely without immunosuppression.

6. **Basal Cell Carcinoma**
   - Considered due to the patient’s age and skin lesion characteristics, though green-gray coloration is atypical.

7. **Pigmented Actinic Keratosis**
   - Elevated for commonality and presenting as plaques but still low due to atypical coloration.

8. **Melanoma**
   - Requires considering due to the potential variability in presentation but less likely given the stable period and the color described.

9. **Lichen Planus Pigmentosus**
   - Downgraded due to inconsistency with the patient's oncological history and presentation.

10. **Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation**
    - Less likely considering the patient denies exacerbating factors and the nodules are not described as sequela of injury or inflammation.

A 55-year-old woman from the Southeastern US with a history of smoking, poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1c level, 15.5%), and chronic pain from osteoarthritis treated with inhalational medical marijuana presented with 4 months of productive cough, 22.7-kg (50-lb) weight loss, subjective fevers, and 3 days of worsening chest pain. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a large right upper lobe cavitary mass. She was treated empirically with intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsy was performed. Lung tissue was sent for bacterial, fungal, mycobacterial, and Nocardia cultures and for histopathology. BAL cultures grew 100 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL of group B streptococci and 1 CFU/mL of Aspergillus niger. Results of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and GeneXpert MTB/RIF testing were negative. Voriconazole was added to her treatment. Transbronchial biopsy histopathology showed acute and chronic inflammation, granulation tissue and necrosis, and negative fungal and AFB stains. Two weeks later, the patient reported worsening right-sided chest pain provoked by palpation, right arm movement, and deep inspiration. Repeat chest CT demonstrated cavitary mass enlargement with possible pleural invasion (Figure 1, left). She developed hypoxemia and required intubation. A right-sided tension pneumothorax developed and required emergency chest tube placement, which yielded charcoal-colored pleural fluid (Figure 1, right).

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis After Considering All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Fungal Infection (Other than Aspergillosis)**: Given the presence of Aspergillus niger in cultures, a fungal infection needs to be high on the list, even though stains were negative.
2. **Aspergillosis**: The identification of Aspergillus niger in BAL culture remains suggestive.
3. **Lung Cancer (Primary or Metastatic)**: A cavitary mass with necrosis and pleural invasion raises high suspicion for malignancy.
4. **Nocardia Infection**: Although cultures did not initially indicate Nocardia, the clinical picture remains highly consistent, and it cannot be ruled out yet.
5. **Empyema Necessitans**: Development of a tension pneumothorax and presence of charcoal-colored pleural fluid suggests an aggressive infectious process.
6. **Pulmonary Tuberculosis**: Despite negative AFB smears and GeneXpert, the chronicity and X-ray findings make TB a plausible differential, subject to further tests.
7. **Pulmonary Abscess**: Empirically treated initially with antibiotics for a presumed bacterial infection but requires further clarification as to the causative agent.
8. **Histoplasmosis**: The regional endemicity and the clinical presentation make this fungal infection a differential.
9. **Paragonimiasis**: While less likely, given the patient's location and typical presentation, parasitic infections in the lung should not be completely ruled out.
10. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**: Although autoimmune etiology fits the necrotizing inflammation profile, it is less likely given the current infectious leads.

A 66-year-old healthy man presented with a 9-day history of a progressively enlarging right lower eyelid lesion. He was seen by an outside ophthalmologist and prescribed oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (675 mg/125 mg) and ophthalmic tobramycin for presumed bacterial infection without improvement. The lesion was not painful but was associated with ipsilateral facial numbness. On examination, he manifested a 9 × 6-mm ulcerated marginal lesion of the central right lower eyelid with surrounding edema and erythema (Figure 1). There was no associated lash loss and the region was nontender to palpation. There was notable hypoesthesia in the distribution of the trigeminal maxillary branch. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. The pupils were round and brisk without an afferent pupillary defect. He manifested full extraocular movements.

1. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**
   - Given the progressively enlarging lesion on the eyelid, BCC is a common periorbital malignancy in elderly patients and often presents as a nodular lesion.

2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**
   - SCC can present as an ulcerated eyelid lesion and should be considered, especially with associated edema and erythema.

3. **Sebaceous Gland Carcinoma**
   - Presents as a painless eyelid lesion and can mimic other eyelid tumors; the patient's age puts him at a higher risk.

4. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma**
   - Although rare, this aggressive carcinoma can also manifest as a rapidly enlarging eyelid lesion.

5. **Malignant Melanoma**
   - Eyelid melanoma can present as a pigmented or non-pigmented lesion and should be considered in any atypical eyelid growth.

6. **Lymphoma**
   - Orbital lymphoma can present with a painless eyelid mass and associated facial numbness due to nerve involvement.

7. **Adenocarcinoma of the Lacrimal Gland**
   - Can cause an eyelid mass and facial hypoesthesia due to compression of nearby structures.

8. **Chalazion**
   - A benign condition, but chronic lesions can sometimes mimic malignant ones; has not shown improvement with antibiotics, which is atypical.

9. **Blepharitis with Secondary Infection**
   - Chronic blepharitis can cause eyelid lesions and secondary infection but often presents with more prominent lash issues.

10. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans**
    - A rare soft tissue sarcoma that can affect the periocular region, presenting as a progressive nodular lesion.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information:

1. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)** - Most likely given the ulcerated, progressive nature, and common presentation in this age group.
2. **Sebaceous Gland Carcinoma** - Next likely given the painless, unapparent nature of the lesion, and middle-aged adult presentation.
3. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)** - Considered due to ulcerated nature and the chronic presentation.
4. **Lymphoma** - The associated hypoesthesia is a key symptom that elevates this diagnosis.
5. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma** - Aggressive nature and growing lesion fits but it's less common compared to BCC and SCC.
6. **Adenocarcinoma of the Lacrimal Gland** - Uncommon but possible due to its association with facial hypoesthesia.
7. **Malignant Melanoma** - Atypical presentation, could still be a contender, given any atypical growth.
8. **Chalazion** - Typically would see improvement with antibiotic treatment, though chronic forms could mimic malignancies.
9. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans** - Rare presentation in periocular area, still needs to be considered.
10. **Blepharitis with Secondary Infection** - Least likely given the chronicity and presentation but still has to be excluded.

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old woman presented with an asymptomatic enlarging right parotid mass of about 6 years’ duration. She had no prior medical or surgical history and took no medications. Ultrasonography demonstrated a solid and hypoechoic mass, 1.5 × 1.0 × 0.9 cm, in the inferior right parotid gland with minimal vascularity and without extraparotid extension. No lymph node abnormality was observed. Fine-needle aspiration was performed, and the smear was extremely cellular and showed sheets and clusters of bland polygonal epithelial cells admixed with bright pink filamentous matrix. Because of the size and location, extracapsular dissection II was carried out.1 The final pathology of the lesion showed histologic findings compatible with salivary gland carcinoma, with microcystic and papillary architecture (Figure, A and B). Abundant bubbly secretion was present within these microcystic spaces, and this material was positive for periodic acid–Schiff (Figure, C). Immunohistochemically, there was positivity for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK19, S100 protein, and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15). Stains for gastrointestinal stromal tumors 1 (DOG1) and p63 were negative. The tumor appeared to be contained within the surgical excision margins. There was perineural invasion without evidence of neoplastic emboli in the peritumoral lymphovascular spaces. The patient underwent a right parotidectomy I to IV1 and a level II superselective neck dissection.

6. **Basal Cell Adenoma**
7. **Oncocytoma**
8. **Polymorphous Low-Grade Adenocarcinoma**
9. **Clear Cell Carcinoma**
10. **Carcinoma Ex Pleomorphic Adenoma**

### Reranked Diagnoses Using All Information

1. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma** - Given the histological findings with microcystic and papillary architecture along with positive periodic acid–Schiff material, which is more consistent with mucoepidermoid histology.
2. **Acinic Cell Carcinoma** - The immunohistochemical profile, particularly the positivity for S100 and GCDFP-15, supports this diagnosis.
3. **Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma** - Considered due to perineural invasion, but less likely without typical cribriform patterns.
4. **Polymorphous Low-Grade Adenocarcinoma** - The diverse morphologic patterns and perineural invasion seen in the specimen are features of this carcinoma.
5. **Clear Cell Carcinoma** - Should be considered due to lack of myoepithelial differentiation, but typically would expect clear cells histologically.
6. **Pleomorphic Adenoma** - Given the long duration and cellular composition, this benign tumor is still a differential but less likely given the final pathology.
7. **Oncocytoma** - Typically presents a more granular cytoplasm histologically, which isn't described here.
8. **Basal Cell Adenoma** - Usually has a distinct basaloid appearance, not closely matching the given description.
9. **Carcinoma Ex Pleomorphic Adenoma** - Would expect areas showing transition from benign to malignant cells, less consistent with final pathology.
10. **Warthin Tumor** - Typically seen in smokers with a histologically distinct appearance of cystic structures and lymphoid stroma, which isn't described here.

Thus, the final, comprehensive evaluation points towards **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma** as the primary differential diagnosis based on the multiple correlating histologic and immunohistochemical findings.","['Otolaryngology', 'Salivary Gland Disorders', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Oncology', 'Head and Neck Cancer']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,44.0,F

### INPUT:
A 32-year-old man with a diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy sought care for angina and dyspnea with exertion. His chest pain and dyspnea were chronic and had recently increased in frequency. His cardiomyopathy followed a diagnosis of myocarditis after repeated putative chest colds and chest pain at age 14 years, at which time the ejection fraction was reported to be 30%. The results of a graded exercise stress test at 22 years were unremarkable. On examination, he was afebrile. His heart rate was 68 beats per minute, his blood pressure was 114/77 mm Hg, and his examination was notable for an absence of jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, and murmurs or extra heart sounds. His electrocardiogram, shown in Figure 1, was notable for right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block, unchanged from his electrocardiogram at age 14 years. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 40%. An exercise nuclear stress test revealed a fixed, severe apical defect, a partially reversible severe anterior wall defect, moderate global hypokinesis, and severe hypokinesis of the distal anterior wall and apex. His ejection fraction was estimated to be 32%. Given these findings, left-sided heart catheterization was performed. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",An anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps

1. **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)**: Given the chest pain, dyspnea, fixed apical defect, and partially reversible anterior wall defect, CAD could be a primary consideration.
 
2. **Ischemic Cardiomyopathy**: Frequent chest pain and significant hypokinesis with a low ejection fraction suggest the possibility of ischemic cardiomyopathy.

3. **Non-Ischemic Cardiomyopathy**: Given his history of myocarditis and chronic dilated cardiomyopathy since a young age, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy cannot be ruled out.

4. **Valvular Heart Disease**: Although no murmurs were detected, subtle valvular abnormalities may contribute to his symptoms and should be evaluated further.

5. **Chronic Heart Failure**: Chronic symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue, coupled with the low ejection fraction, can indicate underlying chronic heart failure.

6. **Viral Myocarditis Recurrence**: His history of myocarditis as a teenager might point to a recurrence or a chronic inflammatory process.

7. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)**: The presence of right bundle branch block and hypokinesis might hint at ARVC, despite fewer signs on physical examination.

8. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)**: Misdiagnosis initially, with HCM sometimes masking as dilated cardiomyopathy particularly early in its course.

9. **Sarcoidosis**: Granulomatous infiltration in the heart can mimic these findings and should be considered, especially in non-ischemic cases.

10. **Amyloidosis**: Infiltrative diseases like amyloidosis could present with similar heart defects and symptoms.

### Reranked Diagnoses Using All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)**: Most consistent with fixed and partially reversible defects on stress testing, requiring left-sided catheterization.
2. **Ischemic Cardiomyopathy**: Well-aligned with chronic chest pain and dyspnea, confirmed by hypokinesis on stress tests and low ejection fraction.
3. **Non-Ischemic Cardiomyopathy**: His chronic history since myocarditis suggests a non-ischemic progression.
4. **Chronic Heart Failure**: Symptoms of dyspnea, low ejection fraction, and stress test hypokinesis support this diagnosis.
5. **Viral Myocarditis Recurrence**: Possible due to his history and progression of symptoms since initial diagnosis.
6. **Valvular Heart Disease**: Needs further exploration due to possible subtle manifestations.
7. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)**: Requires consideration given the EKG findings, even if less likely.
8. **Sarcoidosis**: In context, less likely but plausible due to mimicking factors.
9. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)**: Rare transformation/error in early diagnosis, but considered.
10. **Amyloidosis**: Least likely without supporting signs but worthy of consideration due to similar ultimate symptomatology.","['Heart Failure', 'Ischemic Heart Disease', 'Cardiology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his 30s with a history of treatment-naive HIV (CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3) and untreated syphilis presented to the emergency department with 3 weeks of progressively worsening dysphonia, dyspnea, and biphasic stridor. On arrival to the hospital, the patient had a computed tomography scan performed; results demonstrated an obstructive laryngeal mass but no signs of local invasion or lymphadenopathy. The patient was taken urgently to the operating room where an awake tracheostomy was performed without complication. Findings of a direct laryngoscopy demonstrated violaceous nodules of the base of the tongue as well as a mass of the infraglottis and subglottis, which was nearly completely obstructing the airway (Figure, A and B). Full physical examination findings also demonstrated violaceous nodules involving the patient’s lower extremities.

### Re-ranked Differential Diagnosis Based on Comprehensive Patient Information:

1. **Kaposi Sarcoma** (Highly suggestive due to HIV, HHV-8 positivity, violaceous nodules, and spindle cell lesion with erythrocyte extravasation)
2. **Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma** (Common in immunocompromised individuals, can present as mass and airway obstruction)
3. **Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma** (Possibility given mass formation in the laryngeal area, although less likely without local invasion)
4. **Syphilitic Gumma** (Untreated syphilis history, though less common to present in this manner)
5. **Histoplasmosis** (Opportunistic infection in HIV patients, can present with mass lesions)
6. **Tuberculosis** (Common in HIV patients, can cause airway obstruction, though typically has more systemic signs)
7. **Laryngeal Papillomatosis** (Results in airway masses but typically presents earlier in life)
8. **Sarcoidosis** (Can cause nodular lesions and airway involvement but less likely given clinical scenario)
9. **Wegener's Granulomatosis** (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis) (Less likely due to lack of systemic vasculitis symptoms)
10. **Chronic Laryngitis** (Unlikely to present with a mass causing near-complete airway obstruction)

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old healthy Hispanic woman presented with 2 days of photophobia in her right eye. Her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/30 + 2 OD and 20/20 OS. Her intraocular pressure, extraocular motility, and pupillary light reactions were normal. An examination demonstrated trace anterior cells in the right eye; otherwise, the examination had normal results. No vitreous cells were present. Topical prednisolone was started for presumed acute anterior uveitis. One week later, the photophobia had improved. However, unnoticed by the patient, her BCVA had worsened to 20/200 OD and 20/40 OS. An examination demonstrated new subretinal fluid in the macula in the right eye (Figure 1A). Fluorescein angiography showed peripapillary speckled pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence in the right eye. Indocyanine green showed early choroidal vessel hyperfluorescence and several posterior focal hypofluorescent spots in the midphase in both eyes. Autofluorescence showed patchy hyperautofluorescence in both eyes. Tuberculosis and syphilis testing had negative results. A complete blood cell count was unremarkable. A diagnosis of central serous retinopathy (CSR) was made. The topical prednisolone was stopped. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease,"Given the patient presentation and clinical findings, a differential diagnosis approach needs careful consideration. Let's step through a possible differential diagnosis and then rerank them with all the available patient information and test results step by step.

### Differential Diagnosis Steps:
1. **Central Serous Retinopathy (CSR):**
   - Initial suspicion due to subretinal fluid, visual acuity changes, and the improvement after stopping steroids.
   
2. **Acute Posterior Multifocal Placoid Pigment Epitheliopathy (APMPPE):**
   - Given subretinal fluid and patchy autofluorescence which can mimic CSR.
   
3. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Disease:**
   - Considering Hispanic ethnicity, bilateral changes, and subretinal fluid observations.

4. **Multiple Evanescent White Dot Syndrome (MEWDS):**
   - Young adults, usually unilateral visual changes, hyperfluorescence and hypofluorescent spots.
   
5. **Sarcoidosis:**
   - Can present with anterior uveitis and choroidal involvement.
   
6. **Toxoplasmosis:**
   - Causes significant retinal changes and can present similarly.
   
7. **Birdshot Chorioretinopathy:**
   - Autoimmune condition leading to the similar vision changes, though more common in older adults.
   
8. **Lupus Choroidopathy:**
   - Given systemic changes and visual symptoms in other autoimmune disorders to consider.
   
9. **Punctate Inner Choroidopathy (PIC):**
   - Presence of choroidal lesions and visual disturbances in healthy individuals.
   
10. **Acute Macular Neuroretinopathy (AMN):**
    - Rare, often misdiagnosed, involves sudden vision loss and peculiar retinal lesions.

### Reranking Differential Diagnosis:
Based on the full clinical picture and test results, here’s a revised prioritization:

1. **Central Serous Retinopathy (CSR):**
   - The presence of subretinal fluid, the visual symptoms, and the improvement after stopping steroids strongly support CSR.

2. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Disease:**
   - Given her ethnicity, bilateral findings, and subretinal fluid must be considered though less probable without other VKH symptoms like meningismus or skin changes.

3. **Multiple Evanescent White Dot Syndrome (MEWDS):**
   - Close differential due to unilateral visual changes initially but usually has granular white spots on the retina.

4. **Acute Posterior Multifocal Placoid Pigment Epitheliopathy (APMPPE):**
   - Hyperfluorescence and ERG changes are critical but less acute progression compared to CSR.

5. **Punctate Inner Choroidopathy (PIC):**
   - Fits well but less likely given sudden vision loss and younger demographics mostly affected.

6. **Sarcoidosis:**
   - Systemic involvement and typical fundus changes needed which are absent here.

7. **Birdshot Chorioretinopathy:**
   - Less likely without HLA- A29 histocompatibility antigen and older age onset more common.

8. **Lupus Choroidopathy:**
   - Likelihood remote given unremarkable blood work and absence of other lupus symptoms.

9. **Acute Macular Neuroretinopathy (AMN):**
   - Rare condition, but vision changes and typical small, intraretinal lesions would need further consideration.

10. **Toxoplasmosis:**
   - Given that vitreous cells were absent and there's no lesion typically associated with toxoplasmosis, it's the least suspected here.

Based on the patient's presentation and test results, CSR remains the most likely diagnosis with the other conditions considered less likely accordingly.",['Ophthalmology'],0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,46.0,F

### INPUT:
A 38-year-old woman without a significant medical history presented with worsening dyspnea and lower extremity edema at 1 week post partum. When at full term, a planned vaginal delivery was complicated by breached position of the fetus, fetal distress, and new onset of fever. The delivery was converted to a cesarean birth, which was uncomplicated. Perioperatively, she had an episode of chest pain that resolved spontaneously. Troponin levels were normal. A vascular ultrasound study ruled out deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities. A non–electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated computed tomography angiogram showed no pulmonary embolism but was otherwise not diagnostic owing to motion artifacts (Figure 1A). She had progressive dyspnea, mild pulmonary congestion noted on chest radiography, and an elevated brain-type natriuretic peptide level greater than 800 pg/mL (conversion to ng/L is 1:1). Physical examination findings showed a new heart murmur. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed, which showed a normal-sized left ventricle and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, severe aortic regurgitation (AR), and a mildly dilated aortic root (Figure 1B and Video). The patient was transferred to our institution for further treatment. The patient was afebrile at that point, and her white blood cell count was within normal limits. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Type A aortic dissection,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Peripartum Cardiomyopathy:**
   - This condition is pertinent given the patient's postpartum status and symptoms of dyspnea and lower extremity edema.

2. **Aortic Dissection:**
   - Mildly dilated aortic root and severe aortic regurgitation can suggest aortic dissection.

3. **Endocarditis:**
   - New heart murmur and severe aortic regurgitation in the postpartum period.

4. **Congestive Heart Failure:**
   - Elevated BNP level, dyspnea, and pulmonary congestion.

5. **Postpartum Hormonal Cardiovascular Changes:**
   - Hormonal changes postpartum affecting cardiovascular system.

6. **Acute Rheumatic Fever:**
   - New murmur may hint at heart valve involvement from rheumatic fever.

7. **Aortic Root Abscess:**
   - Due to the severe AR and recent febrile episode.

8. **Mitral Valve Prolapse:**
   - Can cause regurgitation and murmur, although typically associated with mitral regurgitation.

9. **Hypertensive Heart Disease:**
   - Though she is afebrile and normotensive, it could lead to symptoms described.

10. **Pulmonary Hypertension:**
    - Can lead to dyspnea and symptoms described, although other signs are not present.

### Final Rerank using all Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Peripartum Cardiomyopathy:**
   - The temporal relation to delivery and symptoms support this diagnosis.

2. **Endocarditis:**
   - Despite afebrile status now, the new murmur and severe AR postpartum point towards this often subtle and deceptive condition.

3. **Aortic Dissection:**
   - Given the severe AR and mildly dilated aortic root in the echocardiogram results.

4. **Aortic Root Abscess:**
   - Severe aortic regurgitation and recent fever make this a critical differential.

5. **Congestive Heart Failure:**
   - Elevated BNP and symptoms of fluid overload.

6. **Pulmonary Hypertension:**
   - Pulmonary congestion and dyspnea can align with this diagnosis.

7. **Acute Rheumatic Fever:**
   - New murmur postpartum could indicate this, despite the lack of other supporting symptoms.

8. **Mitral Valve Prolapse:**
   - Less likely, as the primary issue is aortic regurgitation.

9. **Postpartum Hormonal Cardiovascular Changes:**
   - Hormonal fluctuations postpartum can impact heart function, but less supported by specific findings.

10. **Hypertensive Heart Disease:**
    - Without hypertension, this is less likely.

The patient was previously treated with an oral combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid and topical gentamicin therapy without any improvement. The patient’s visual acuity, color vision, and pupillary examination results were within normal limits, and intraocular pressures were 28 mm Hg OD and 20 mm Hg OS. The extraocular movements and confrontational visual fields were normal. There was right upper and lower eyelid edema with mild erythema and 3 mm of proptosis. The eyelids were nontender to palpation. There was trace vasodilation and chemosis of the conjunctiva in the right eye. The remainder of the slitlamp and dilated fundus examination results were within normal limits. Computed tomography of the orbits and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits showed a large lesion of the right greater wing of the sphenoid bone extending toward the orbital apex with edema and enhancement of the right temporal lobe of the brain (Figure 1). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Langerhans cell histiocytosis,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Orbital Cellulitis** - Initial consideration given the periorbital swelling and erythema.
2. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - Given the age, proptosis, and a mass lesion noted on imaging.
3. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - Consistent with bone involvement and orbital mass.
4. **Neuroblastoma** - Pediatric orbital tumors can present similarly.
5. **Lymphoma** - Given the appearance of the lesion in the orbit.
6. **Orbital Meningioma** - A differential due to the bony origin and involvement.
7. **Dermoid Cyst** - Though usually in younger patients, it can present as a mass.
8. **Metastatic Disease** - Considering a rare possibility of metastatic neoplasms.
9. **Inflammatory Pseudotumor** - Due to enhancement seen on imaging.
10. **Osteomyelitis** - Bony involvement secondary to infection.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on Complete Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** 
   - Highly consistent with the imaging findings suggesting bone involvement extending towards the orbital apex, typical in pediatric age groups.
2. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** 
   - Common pediatric orbital tumor with proptosis and a mass lesion.
3. **Lymphoma** 
   - Presenting as a mass in the orbit with extended bone involvement.
4. **Neuroblastoma** 
   - Though less likely, requires consideration due to potential for orbital metastasis.
5. **Orbital Meningioma** 
   - Given the bone extension and involvement of the orbital apex, though less common in children.
6. **Inflammatory Pseudotumor** 
   - Persistent mass and involvement of the orbit can be a clue.
7. **Metastatic Disease** 
   - Always a consideration albeit rare without primary symptoms.
8. **Dermoid Cyst** 
   - Less likely given the age and the complex nature of the lesion.
9. **Osteomyelitis** 
   - Unlikely with the bone involvement observed through imaging.
10. **Orbital Cellulitis** 
    - Initial antibiotic treatment was ineffective, inconsistent with such a persistent mass.

**Step 1: Differential Diagnosis Based on Initial Presentation and Appearance of Lesion**
1. Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE) - Chronic, pruritic, erythematous patches with central scarring are characteristic.

**Step 2: Consider Treatment Response and Lack of Improvement Post-Treatment**
2. Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL) - Lesions that do not respond to antivirals or antibiotics might suggest this.

**Step 3: Consider Histological Findings**
3. Granuloma Annulare - Histology often shows palisading granulomas.

**Step 4: Include Common Inflammatory Dermatoses**
4. Psoriasis - Chronic, erythematous plaques with silver scales.

**Step 5: Considering Possible Infections**
5. Borrelia Infection (e.g., Lyme disease) - Similar appearance to erythema migrans.

**Step 6: Inclusion of Immune-Mediated Diseases**
6. Sarcoidosis - Non-caseating granulomas appear histologically.

**Step 7: Drug Reactions**
7. Fixed Drug Eruption - Recurs at the same site upon re-exposure to the offending drug.

**Step 8: Hygiene or Contact-Related Dermatoses**
8. Contact Dermatitis - Allergic or irritant dermatitis can show as erythematous patches.

**Step 9: Inclusion of Vascular Disorders**
9. Vasculitis - Can present with tender erythematous patches.

**Step 10: Rare Causes**
10. Erysipelas - Though usually more acute, its chronicity can mimic inflammatory dermatoses.

### Reranking Based on Additional Data and Test Results:

Upon receiving the histological and immunohistochemical results:
1. **Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL)** - Histology typically shows atypical T-cells.
2. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE)** - Histology often shows interface dermatitis and anti-nuclear antibodies positive on immunohistochemistry.
3. **Sarcoidosis** - Non-caseating granulomas would be present histologically.
4. **Borrelia Infection (e.g., Lyme disease)** - Specific staining or PCR can identify Borrelia.
5. **Granuloma Annulare** - Palisading histiocytes around altered collagen.
6. **Psoriasis** - Epidermal hyperplasia, parakeratosis, and neutrophils.
7. **Vasculitis** - Small blood vessel necrosis and inflammation on histology.
8. **Contact Dermatitis** - Spongiosis and lymphocytic infiltrate histologically.
9. **Fixed Drug Eruption** - Inflammatory infiltrate, eosinophils on histology.
10. **Erysipelas** - Dermal lymphatic involvement but rare persistent histological signs.

1. **Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)**: The endoscopic findings of vertical furrows and circumferential rings, along with the clinical presentation of progressively worsening dysphagia, are strongly suggestive of EoE.

2. **Achalasia**: Dysphagia for solids, especially meats, aligns with this condition. The typically unremarkable physical exam matches this diagnosis, though the endoscopic findings would be atypical for achalasia.

3. **Esophageal Stricture**: Chronic progressive dysphagia can be indicative of an esophageal stricture, though typically associated with a history of reflux or esophagitis, which the patient didn't report.

4. **Esophageal Webs or Rings (Schatzki Ring)**: These structural abnormalities can also explain dysphagia, but the endoscopic findings (vertical furrows and concentric rings) do not match perfectly.

5. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) with Esophagitis**: This is a common cause of dysphagia, yet the absence of heartburn and the specific endoscopic findings point away from typical reflux esophagitis.

6. **Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma)**: Known to cause esophageal dysmotility, but usually associated with diverse systemic symptoms and specific endoscopic findings, which are absent here.

7. **Plummer-Vinson Syndrome**: Typically presents with dysphagia and iron-deficiency anemia, which is not demonstrated in this patient's case. The EGD findings do not align.

8. **Esophageal Cancer**: Progressive dysphagia can be a red flag, but the normal physical exam, absence of alarming systemic symptoms, and specific EGD findings argue against it.

9. **Infectious Esophagitis**: Opportunistic infections in the esophagus usually present with immunocompromised individuals, with findings that differ from those documented in EGD.

10. **Diffuse Esophageal Spasm**: Presents with intermittent dysphagia and chest pain, but the endoscopic findings and lack of described spasms or pain make this less likely.

Reranking the differentials based on the composite of clinical presentation, EGD results, and biopsy findings:

1. **Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)**

### INPUT:
A 19-year-old man presented with recurrent left eye redness and photophobia for the past year. The patient had previously been treated with topical corticosteroid therapy, which provided temporary relief of his symptoms. Visual acuity was 20/20 OU with normal intraocular pressures. The results from the slitlamp examination of the right eye were within normal limits (Figure 1A). Examination results of the left eye demonstrated 2+ diffuse conjunctival hyperemia, 1+ anterior chamber cell, and a vascularized iris infiltrate (Figure 1B). Results of the dilated fundus examination were within normal limits in both eyes. Ultrasound biomicroscopy of the left eye demonstrated areas of ciliary body thickening 360° and a thickened iris pupillary margin superiorly and nasally. A full review of systems was negative for other abnormalities including skin lesions. Test results for tuberculosis and syphilis were negative.

9. **Birdshot Chorioretinopathy**
10. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis
Now, let’s rerank the differential diagnoses based on the provided patient information and test results:

1. **Anterior Uveitis**: Given the recurrent nature, photophobia, and findings of anterior chamber cell and diffuse conjunctival hyperemia, anterior uveitis is the most plausible diagnosis.

2. **Idiopathic Uveitis**: Considering the comprehensive negative systemic review and lack of additional abnormalities, an idiopathic origin is highly probable.

3. **Herpetic Iridocyclitis**: Recurrent episodes and anterior chamber findings, along with iris infiltrate and ciliary body thickening, point towards a potential viral origin.

4. **Fuchs' Heterochromic Iridocyclitis**: This would be considered due to recurrent inflammation and the vascularized iris infiltrates, but lack of heterochromia might lower its ranking.

5. **Sarcoidosis**: Systemic negative results and lack of systemic symptoms make this less likely, but still within consideration due to uveitis and idiopathic systemic presentation.

6. **Ankylosing Spondylitis-associated Uveitis**: Common cause of recurrent anterior uveitis in young males but usually presents with back pain or stiffness which is not reported here.

7. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease**: Although VKH could present uveitis, this patient lacks skin abnormalities such as vitiligo or poliosis, and CNS involvement.

8. **Lens-Induced Uveitis**: No history of trauma or surgery and the patient is quite young, making this less likely but worth considering.

9. **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis-associated Uveitis**: Less common in males and no other indications of arthritis.

10. **Birdshot Chorioretinopathy**: Given the fundus examination is normal and patient age, this rare condition is less likely.

### INPUT:
A 17-year-old white male patient was referred to the otolaryngology clinic with a 6-month history of a left-sided neck mass. His primary care physician initially obtained an ultrasonographic image, which demonstrated a left, level 2 lymph node measuring 4.0 × 1.5 × 2.8 cm. The patient then underwent several courses of antibiotic treatment, but the mass persisted. After a period of conservative management, he developed a sore throat and fever. He subsequently underwent a computed tomographic scan of the neck and chest with contrast, which demonstrated an isolated, enlarged, homogenously enhancing left-neck level 2B lymph node measuring 3.4 × 2.8 × 2.1 cm (Figure 1A). When he presented to our facility, he was found to have an asymptomatically enlarged left level 2/5A neck mass that was nontender and fixed. The patient had an unremarkable medical, surgical, and social history and no known infectious exposures. A white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level were both elevated, at 11 310 cells/μL (to convert to cells × 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) and 56.2 mg/L (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524), respectively. Studies for influenza A and B, HIV, cytomegalovirus, American foulbrood, Bartonella henselae, infectious mononucleosis, and Epstein-Barr virus had negative results. An ultrasonography-guided needle biopsy was performed. Fine-needle aspiration and flow cytometry had negative results for lymphoproliferative disorders or a malignant condition. A tissue culture had negative results. Given the inconclusive diagnosis, the patient underwent a left neck dissection of levels 2A, 2B, and 5A. Intraoperative frozen sections did not show a malignant process. On final analysis, a pathologic examination of the largest lymph node was performed (Figure 1B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Castleman disease,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps

1. **Bacterial Lymphadenitis**
   - Characterized by enlarged, nontender lymph nodes with elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein.

2. **Granulomatous Lymphadenitis**
   - Persistent lymph node enlargement despite antibiotic treatment; may need histopathological examination to confirm.

3. **Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease**
   - Persistent, localized lymphadenopathy; typically affects young adults.

4. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Can present with persistent, enlarged lymph nodes and elevated inflammatory markers.

5. **Kawasaki Disease**
   - Though more common in younger children, this can involve lymphadenopathy, fever, and elevated inflammatory markers.

6. **Castleman Disease**
   - Rare, can present with lymphadenopathy and elevated inflammatory markers.

7. **Tuberculosis (Atypical Mycobacterial Infection)**
   - Persistent lymphadenopathy, often resistant to typical antibiotics; culture negative does not rule it out.

8. **Cat Scratch Disease**
   - Often presents with localized lymphadenopathy and elevated inflammatory markers; usually Bartonella henselae positive.

9. **Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome**
   - Persistent lymphadenopathy, often negative initial tests, and elevated inflammatory markers.

10. **Rosai-Dorfman Disease**
    - Can present as massive lymphadenopathy with elevated inflammatory markers and unremarkable initial investigations.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Granulomatous Lymphadenitis**
   - Considering the lymph node biopsy pathologic examination and the chronic nature of the lymph node enlargement.

2. **Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease**
   - Young male with persistent lymphadenopathy, elevated inflammatory markers, and histopathology excluding malignancy.

3. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Chronic, non-resolving lymphadenopathy with systemic signs of inflammation.

4. **Castleman Disease**
   - Persistent lymphadenopathy with elevated inflammatory markers; rare but possible given the presentation.

5. **Rosai-Dorfman Disease**
   - Characterized by lymph node histopathology indicating massive lymphadenopathy and elevated inflammatory markers.
 
6. **Kawasaki Disease**
   - Less likely, given the age and absence of other cardinal signs, but possible due to persistent inflammatory response.

7. **Tuberculosis (Atypical Mycobacterial Infection)**
   - Persistent lymphadenopathy, resistant to initial empirical therapy, often requiring specific cultures and biopsies.

8. **Bacterial Lymphadenitis**
   - Initially considered but less likely due to extensive work-up and prolonged course resolving towards other diagnoses.

9. **Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome**
   - Chronic and recurrent lymphadenopathy but less indicated by the histopathological findings and other test results.

10. **Cat Scratch Disease**
    - Very unlikely due to negative Bartonella henselae test results despite similar presentation.

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old man was referred to the Department of Otolaryngology from the Department of Sleep Medicine for surgical evaluation of his tonsillar hypertrophy. The patient’s medical history was notable for severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosed in the fall of 2017, when he presented with snoring, progressive daytime fatigue, and several years of migraines. Since his diagnosis, he had been adherent to use of nightly continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, he had persistent daytime fatigue and morning headaches. Several months before presentation, the patient noticed that his bite changed from an overbite to an underbite (Figure, A), which had been attributed to dental malocclusion from his CPAP machine. Examination findings of the oropharynx showed an oropharynx score of a Mallampati 4, with 3-plus tonsils and macroglossia without scalloping of the tongue (Figure, B). Nasopharyngolaryngoscopic examination findings showed that the tonsils did not approximate at midline, with a narrow anterior-to-posterior dimension of the airway owing to macroglossia and no retrognathia. On further review of systems, the patient reported growth in his tongue and feet and intermittent swelling with numbness in his hands over the past year. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Acromegaly,"Sure, let's proceed step by step to develop a differential diagnosis for this patient, then we'll rank all 10 differential diagnoses using all patient information and test results.

### Differential Diagnosis Steps

1. **Acromegaly**: Based on the reported growth in the patient's tongue and feet, as well as the change in the bite pattern, acromegaly should be considered due to excess growth hormone production.

2. **Hypothyroidism**: Fatigue, macroglossia, and the presence of sleep apnea could be suggestive of hypothyroidism.

3. **Amyloidosis**: The presence of macroglossia can be a hallmark of amyloidosis.

4. **Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21)**: Even though this is a congenital condition and the patient's age and history do not support it, the combination of macroglossia and tonsillar hypertrophy could prompt a consideration.

5. **Mucopolysaccharidosis**: This condition involves mucopolysaccharides' buildup, leading to macroglossia, and generally presents earlier in life but can be considered given the symptoms.

6. **Lymphangioma**: A benign tumor of the lymphatic vessels that can cause macroglossia.

7. **Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (Pickwickian Syndrome)**: This can be associated with obstructive sleep apnea and might present with similar overlapping symptoms, though typically not with bite changes or macroglossia.

8. **Primary Amyloidosis (AL amyloidosis)**: Particularly focused on the deposition of amyloid in tissues, including the tongue.

9. **Cushing's Syndrome**: The patient’s persistent fatigue and presentation could hint towards an endocrine disorder like Cushing's, though macroglossia is less characterized in this condition.

10. **Angioedema**: This can cause intermittent swelling and numbness but is typically more acute and episodic in presentation, without consistent overgrowth of tongue and limbs.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses Using All Patient Information and Test Results

Given the full clinical picture, the hypotheses can be ranked in the following order:

1. **Acromegaly**: The combination of sleep apnea, macroglossia, change in bite, and new-onset overgrowth of tongue and feet aligns closely with acromegaly.
   
2. **Amyloidosis**: The presence of macroglossia fits well; further diagnostic tests would be needed to confirm amyloid deposits.

3. **Hypothyroidism**: Persistent symptoms of fatigue and macroglossia could very well fit a hypothyroid profile.
   
4. **Primary Amyloidosis (AL amyloidosis)**: Similar to general amyloidosis; further characterizing which amyloid type is essential.
   
5. **Mucopolysaccharidosis**: Though less likely given the onset in adulthood, should be considered for completeness.
   
6. **Cushing's Syndrome**: Although a bit broad and less likely for the specific symptoms, still possible.
   
7. **Lymphangioma**: More often presents with localized macroglossia rather than whole systemic symptoms.
   
8. **Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (Pickwickian Syndrome)**: Presentation may overlap with OSA, but doesn't explain change in bite or overgrowth of limbs.
  
9. **Angioedema**: Intermittent swelling aligns but doesn't typically cause persistent overgrowth and bite changes.
 
10. **Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21)**: Least likely, because it is a congenital condition and not typically diagnosed at this age without previous identification.

Based on all patient information available, acromegaly stands out as the most probable diagnosis. Further diagnostic workup should include an assessment of growth hormone levels and imaging studies to evaluate for pituitary adenoma.","['Endocrine Surgery', 'Endocrinology', 'Neurosurgery', 'Pulmonary Medicine', 'Sleep Medicine']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,44.0,M

### INPUT:
A male patient in his 70s presented an asymptomatic, slightly eroded, translucent nodule on his right nipple (Figure, A). There was a family history of cutaneous melanoma in his 2 sisters, daughter, and nephew and breast cancer in his mother and sister. We completed genetic testing of family members and found no genetic mutations in sera samples to predispose them to melanoma skin cancer or breast cancer. The main genes tested were the breast cancer type 1 susceptibility (BRCA1), breast cancer 2–DNA repair associated (BRCA2), partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2), and tumor protein p53 (TP53) genes. A dermoscopic examination of the patient showed a translucent lesion with arborizing vessels and erosion (Figure, B). A punch biopsy was performed. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**
   - Reason: The description of the nodule being translucent with arborizing vessels and erosion is highly suggestive of BCC, which is common in patients of this age.
   
2. **Paget's Disease of the Nipple**
   - Reason: An eroded nodule at the nipple, especially in elderly patients, could be indicative of Paget's disease of the nipple.

3. **Malignant Melanoma**
   - Reason: Given the strong family history of melanoma and the presentation of a nodular lesion, melanoma should be considered.

4. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma**
   - Reason: This rare but aggressive skin cancer typically presents as a rapidly growing, painless nodule, often in older adults.

5. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**
   - Reason: Another common skin cancer in elderly patients, presenting as an eroded or scaly nodule.

6. **Sebaceous Carcinoma**
   - Reason: A rare but possible diagnosis, given the location and description of the lesion.

7. **Cutaneous Metastasis**
   - Reason: The patient's family history of breast cancer warrants consideration of metastatic disease reaching the skin.

8. **Atypical Fibroxanthoma**
   - Reason: This is a cutaneous tumor found predominantly in sun-damaged skin of elderly individuals.

9. **Sebaceous Hyperplasia**
   - Reason: Marked by translucent papules, this benign condition should still be considered.

10. **Keratoacanthoma**
    - Reason: Rapidly growing, dome-shaped nodule that can appear similar to squamous cell carcinoma.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

After reviewing all patient information and test results, particularly the dermoscopic examination and strong familial cancer history, the revised ranking of differential diagnoses is as follows:

1. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**
   - Highest probability due to dermoscopic features (translucent lesion with arborizing vessels and erosion) commonly indicative of BCC.

2. **Paget's Disease of the Nipple**
   - Significant due to the eroded lesion at the nipple, which is characteristic of this disease.

3. **Malignant Melanoma**
   - Due to family history of melanoma, though genetic testing showed no mutations, still warrants a third ranking.

4. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma**
   - High suspicion due to patient age and typical presentation as a nodule in the elderly.

5. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**
   - Common in elderly with sun-exposed and eroded lesions.

6. **Cutaneous Metastasis**
   - Not as high probability but notable due to family history of breast cancer.

7. **Keratoacanthoma**
   - Considered given its rapid growth and nodular presentation in the elderly.

8. **Sebaceous Carcinoma**
   - Less common but should remain in the differential due to potential similarities.

9. **Atypical Fibroxanthoma**
   - Less likely but relevant in considering all potential diagnoses in elderly with sun-damaged skin.

10. **Sebaceous Hyperplasia**
    - Low probability given the description of the lesion but still within the differential.","['Geriatrics', 'Oncology', 'Breast Cancer', 'Dermatology', 'Skin Cancer']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,70.0,M

### INPUT:
A 61-year-old white man with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis presented with hand and wrist pain. Over 2 years, he was prescribed various therapies including prednisone, methotrexate, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, abatacept, and anakinra; he experienced intermittent improvement in his joint pain but had persistently elevated levels of inflammatory markers. He continued to experience asymmetric small- and large-joint polyarthralgias and later developed intermittent fevers (temperatures up to 38.3°C [101°F]) along with a 50-lb (22.7-kg) unintentional weight loss over the course of a few months. On examination, there was subtle synovitis in bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints. Findings on cardiac, pulmonary, and neurologic examinations were unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation was notable for a normocytic anemia and elevated C-reactive protein level (7.7 mg/dL [73.3 nmol/L]). Results of esophagogastroduodenoscopy with gastric biopsies and bone marrow biopsy were unremarkable. Findings on further workup including transthoracic echocardiography to assess for endocarditis, carotid magnetic resonance angiography to assess for vasculitis, and abdominal fat pad biopsy for amyloidosis were also unremarkable. Tocilizumab was initiated. Over the next several months, he developed intermittent abdominal pain, steatorrhea, protein-losing enteropathy, and symmetric bilateral lower extremity edema requiring diuresis. Results of infectious stool studies, celiac serology, and fecal elastase testing were normal. Repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (Figure, panel A) was performed, with gastric and duodenal biopsies (Figure, panels B and C). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Whipple disease,"Let's approach the differential diagnosis step by step, using the information provided about the patient's symptoms, test results, and history.

### Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Whipple’s Disease**: Considering weight loss, steatorrhea, and joint pain with persistent inflammation and lack of a clear diagnosis through standard tests.
2. **Adult-Onset Still's Disease (AOSD)**: Given intermittent fevers, joint pain, and significant weight loss.
3. **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)**: Taking into account the gastrointestinal symptoms and protein-losing enteropathy.
4. **Chronic Infections (e.g., Tuberculosis)**: Considering unexplained fever and weight loss.
5. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: Persistent inflammation, though seronegative RA and no specific markers for lupus noted.
6. **Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)**: Anemia with systemic symptoms could suggest a hematologic malignancy.
7. **Primary Vasculitis (e.g., Polyarteritis Nodosa)**: Unexplained systemic inflammation with GI and joint symptoms.
8. **Amyloidosis**: GI symptoms, protein-losing enteropathy, unexplained systemic symptoms, though early tests were unremarkable.
9. **Malignancy (e.g., Lymphoma)**: Persistent systemic symptoms, weight loss, and intermittent fever.
10. **Sarcoidosis**: Multisystem involvement with persistent inflammation.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Whipple’s Disease**: Gastrointestinal and joint symptoms combined with the lack of diagnosis from typical tests point towards this rare condition, especially as biopsy results are pending to confirm.
2. **Adult-Onset Still's Disease (AOSD)**: Intermittent fever, weight loss, and joint symptoms strongly support AOSD.
3. **Primary Vasculitis (e.g., Polyarteritis Nodosa)**: Persistent symptoms and inflammation warrant a strong consideration for a primary systemic vasculitis.
4. **Amyloidosis**: Although initial tests were negative, the presentation continues to fit, particularly with protein-losing enteropathy.
5. **Chronic Infections (e.g., Tuberculosis)**: Unexplained systemic inflammatory response raises consideration.
6. **Malignancy (e.g., Lymphoma)**: Persistent fevers, weight loss, and unexplained symptoms point towards possible malignancy.
7. **Sarcoidosis**: Multisystem involvement needs reevaluation in light of new symptoms.
8. **Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)**: Still consider due to systemic symptoms and anemia.
9. **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)**: Symptoms partially fit though not all classical markers are present.
10. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: Although possible, less likely due to a lack of other significant markers typically seen in lupus.

### INPUT:
A healthy woman in her 60s was referred by her dentist to an oral surgeon for evaluation of a palatal swelling of unknown duration. The patient first presented to her dentist with a complaint of “it feels like there is something on the roof of [her] mouth.” She was never aware of the palatal lesion before her initial presentation. She denied any pain or discomfort from the site, and stated that the increasing size of the mass was what first alerted her to its presence. The extraoral examination results were within normal limits, with no evidence of swelling, expansion, trismus, or lymphadenopathy. Intraoral examination revealed a focally ulcerated, fluctuant 2.5 × 2 × 1-cm pink-red submucosal swelling in the right palatal mucosa (Figure, A). The lesion involved almost the entire right side of the hard palatal mucosa and soft palate and terminated at the palatal midline. Imaging studies were unremarkable. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,"### Step-by-step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Pleomorphic Adenoma**: Given the patient’s age and the presentation of a painless, submucosal swelling, pleomorphic adenoma of the minor salivary glands should be considered.
2. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma**: A fluctuant, submucosal swelling in the palate could also indicate mucoepidermoid carcinoma, especially given its occurrence in salivary glands.
3. **Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma**: This malignancy commonly occurs in minor salivary glands and can present as a palatal mass, making it a differential diagnosis.
4. **Polymorphous Low-Grade Adenocarcinoma (PLGA)**: This is another type of salivary gland tumor often occurring in the palate.
5. **Lymphoma**: Given the lesion’s characteristics and location, lymphoma of the oral cavity should be considered.
6. **Benign Lymphoepithelial Lesion**: These lesions can occur in the palate and present as asymptomatic masses.
7. **Palatal Torus**: A palatal torus is a benign bony growth but typically presents as a hard mass rather than a fluctuant one.
8. **Cysts (e.g., Dermoid Cyst)**: Cystic lesions such as dermoid cysts can present as fluctuant swellings in the oral cavity.
9. **Pyogenic Granuloma**: Though less likely given the lack of pain and ulceration, it remains a possibility.
10. **Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: While often painful and associated with other signs, it's important to include squamous cell carcinoma in the differential diagnosis.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Pleomorphic Adenoma**: High on the list due to its commonality in minor salivary glands and the symptom profile.
2. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma**: Must be considered seriously due to its relatively higher frequency among salivary gland tumors.
3. **Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma**: Noted for its predilection for the palate in salivary gland tissue.
4. **Polymorphous Low-Grade Adenocarcinoma (PLGA)**: Given its tendency to occur in older patients and its palatal location.
5. **Lymphoma**: Less likely without other systemic symptoms but still a concern due to its potential oral presentation.
6. **Benign Lymphoepithelial Lesion**: This remains in consideration due to the benign nature and presentation.
7. **Cysts (e.g. Dermoid Cyst)**: These could still fit the description of a painless, fluctuant mass.
8. **Pyogenic Granuloma**: Less likely but possible due to the ulceration seen.
9. **Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Always a differential in oral masses despite atypical presentation here.
10. **Palatal Torus**: Least likely due to the fluctuant nature rather than a firm consistency.

An infant boy, born to a nonconsanguineously wed couple, presented to the dermatology outpatient clinic with recurrent skin blisters since age 2 months. The lesions initially started over the trunk and subsequently progressed to involve the face, hands, and feet. The episodes of skin blisters were accompanied by pruritus and redness all over the body. There was no history of oral erosions or difficulty in feeding. Bowel and bladder movements were normal. The child had an older sibling who had no skin ailments, and none of the other family members were affected. On examination, multiple tense, angulated vesicles and bullae on a background of erythema were seen over the face, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A and B). Few urticated papules and wheals were seen in isolation over the trunk. The ruptured bullae were healing with hypopigmentation with accompanying scarring and discrete milia formation. The mucosae and nails were normal. No contractures or webbing of fingers was noted. There was no organomegaly. A punch biopsy from a vesicle was subsequently performed (Figure, C and D).

    ",Bullous mastocytosis,"### Constructing a Differential Diagnosis

Let's systematically consider the information provided, focusing on the presenting symptoms, history, physical examination, and initial biopsy.

**Step 1: Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB)**
- Reasoning: Recurrent skin blisters, onset at 2 months, triggered by minor trauma or with no clear cause, fits well with EB, especially with scarring and milia formation.

**Step 2: Bullous Pemphigoid**
- Reasoning: Tense bullae on erythematous skin, seen in infants, often with associated pruritus, lack of mucosal involvement.

**Step 3: Infantile Dermatitis Herpetiformis**
- Reasoning: Blistering skin condition, associated with intense pruritus, occasionally presenting in infancy.

**Step 4: Congenital Syphilis**
- Reasoning: Though less likely due to lack of systemic symptoms, congenital syphilis can present with bullous lesions in infants.

**Step 5: Herpes Simplex Virus Infection (HSV)**
- Reasoning: History of blistering lesions, though typically more acute onset and accompanied by systemic symptoms, possible secondary bacterial infection could mimic symptoms.

**Step 6: Linear IgA Bullous Dermatosis (LABD)**
- Reasoning: Bullous disorder with tense blisters, rare in infants but possible, often characterized by marked pruritus.

**Step 7: Impetigo**
- Reasoning: Secondary bacterial infection, could present with bullous lesions, typically has honey-colored crusting and not vesicles/bullae on erythematous base.

**Step 8: Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS)**
- Reasoning: Acute onset blistering disease caused by a toxin produced by staphylococci, lack of systemic illness makes this less likely.

**Step 9: Congenital Ichthyosiform Erythroderma**
- Reasoning: Presents with generalized erythema and scaling, blistering can occur, though typically has a different initial presentation.

**Step 10: Autoimmune Bullous Disease (e.g., Pemphigus Vulgaris)**
 - Reasoning: Vesicles and ulcers, mucosal involvement is typical, but a rare presentation in infancy without mucosal involvement could be considered.

### Reranking Using All Patient Information and Test Results

After reviewing all the data, including the biopsy, let's rerank our differential diagnoses appropriately:

1. **Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB)**: Likely, fitting presentation and histopathologic findings, especially with scarring and milia.
2. **Bullous Pemphigoid**: Matches the patient age and presentation, especially pruritus and tense bullae.
3. **Linear IgA Bullous Dermatosis (LABD)**: Rare in infants but has a similar presentation of tense bullae and intense itching.
4. **Infantile Dermatitis Herpetiformis**: Less common but could present with pruritic and blistering skin.
5. **Herpes Simplex Virus Infection (HSV)**: Lower on the differential due to lack of systemic symptoms.
6. **Congenital Syphilis**: Considering the systemic workup could help rule this out.
7. **Impetigo**: Unlikely given the absence of crusting lesions.
8. **Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS)**: Less likely due to the indolent course and absence of systemic symptoms.
9. **Congenital Ichthyosiform Erythroderma**: Less likely given typically more generalized erythema.
10. **Autoimmune Bullous Disease (e.g., Pemphigus Vulgaris)**: Very rare in infancy and without mucosal involvement. 

Appropriate identification of the exact diagnosis would likely require further examination of the biopsy and possibly genetic testing.","['Allergy and Clinical Immunology', 'Pediatrics', 'Dermatology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1.0,M

### INPUT:
A woman in her 30s with active bulimia was brought by ambulance to the emergency department after a syncopal event that followed 1 hour of palpitations and intermittent lightheadedness. When emergency responders arrived, the patient was responsive but groggy. An electrocardiogram (ECG) in the field demonstrated a regular wide complex tachycardia. En route to the hospital, 6 mg of adenosine followed by 12 mg of adenosine were administered intravenously, without a change in her rhythm. On arrival to the emergency department, she was in a regular wide complex tachycardia with a heart rate of 225 beats per minute (Figure, A), with an initial blood pressure of 108/77 mm Hg. She was oriented but slow to respond. After sedation, a synchronized, biphasic, 200-J shock converted her to sinus rhythm with bigeminy (Figure, B), which settled to normal sinus rhythm. An intravenous amiodarone infusion was administered. Her initial laboratory evaluation revealed hypokalemia (2.8 mEq/L; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1.0), hypomagnesemia (3.6 mEq/L; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.50), and an elevated serum troponin (0.13 nanograms per milliliter; to convert to micrograms per milliliter, multiply by 1.0). Potassium and magnesium replacement was administered orally and intravenously. She reported no family history of sudden cardiac death or unexplained premature death. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal biventricular size and function. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)**
2. **Electrolyte Imbalance (Hypokalemia/Hypomagnesemia)**
3. **Long QT Syndrome**
4. **Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction**
5. **Drug-Induced Arrhythmia (e.g., due to medication for bulimia)**
6. **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy**
7. **Brugada Syndrome**
8. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)**
9. **Thyrotoxicosis**
10. **Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis (Based on Comprehensive Analysis):
1. **Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)** - Most consistent with wide complex tachycardia and the patient’s response to cardioversion.
2. **Electrolyte Imbalance (Hypokalemia/Hypomagnesemia)** - Given the patient's laboratory results and history of bulimia, electrolyte disturbances are highly likely to be contributors or primary causes.
3. **Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction** - Elevated troponin level supports possible ischemic event, though less likely primary without significant family history and echocardiogram normality.
4. **Long QT Syndrome** - Can precipitate arrhythmias, indirectly suggested by electrolyte abnormalities.
5. **Drug-Induced Arrhythmia** - Investigate possible medicinal contributions for bulimia as causative agents.
6. **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy** - Wide complex tachycardia considerations though less likely primary given the context.
7. **Brugada Syndrome** - Less likely without specific ECG findings typically suggestive of this condition.
8. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)** - Given normal echo results, less immediate concern.
9. **Thyrotoxicosis** - Could exacerbate or be an underlying cause, but no clear thyroid function results provided.
10. **Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome** - Usually presents with delta waves on ECG; thus less likely given current presentation.","['Cardiology', 'Challenges in Clinical Electrocardiography', 'Rhythm Disorders', 'Feeding and Eating Disorders', 'Psychiatry and Behavioral Health']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,30.0,F

### INPUT:
A 25-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of an enlarging right neck mass. The patient had a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome with insulin resistance and a migraine disorder and reported experiencing 1 to 2 migraine episodes per week since early high school. She believed that the neck mass made these episodes worse than normal. The patient was otherwise previously healthy until she developed an upper respiratory infection. Her physician noted visible swelling in the right neck and clinically interpreted the finding as enlarged lymph nodes associated with the infection. After 2 weeks, the neck swelling persisted despite the resolution of other symptoms. She was subsequently treated with a course of antibiotics, which did not result in any improvement. The mass slowly enlarged over the next 6 months. The patient reported new symptoms, including waxing and waning pain that radiated to the back of her neck, headaches, and intermittent dysphagia. She also noted periods during which the mass would fluctuate in size. Otolaryngologic examination findings were within normal limits except for a single, nontender, compressible right neck mass deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and extending into level V. The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan prior to presentation at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center’s otolaryngology clinic. The scan showed a fatty-appearing tumor within the right carotid space. The patient underwent surgical excision, and a mass measuring 8.0 × 6.5 × 4.7–cm was removed from the carotid space (Figure, A). Additional material from the mass was excised at the level of the base of the skull. Gross pathologic examination demonstrated yellowish-brown, homogenous, lobular adipose tissue covered by a thin, tan, transparent membrane (Figure, A). Histopathologic examination showed relatively uniform univacuolar and multivacuolated, granular eosinophilic cells with centrally placed nucleoli (Figure, B and C). In addition, several level II and level III lymph nodes were excised, all of which were found to be benign. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Hibernoma,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Lipoma**: Given the CT scan showing a fatty-appearing tumor.
2. **Liposarcoma**: Due to the enlarging nature of the mass.
3. **Thyroglossal duct cyst**: Given the location and fluctuation in size.
4. **Branchial cleft cyst**: Presents as a neck mass in young adults.
5. **Lymphangioma**: Fluctuates in size and can be compressible.
6. **Paraganglioma**: Tumor within the carotid space.
7. **Schwannoma**: Often occurs in the neck region.
8. **Carotid body tumor**: Given the location in the carotid space.
9. **Metastatic lymph node**: Especially in level II and III regions.
10. **Fibromatosis**: Rare, but can present as a mass in the neck.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Lipoma**: Confirmed by gross pathologic and histopathologic examination demonstrating yellowish-brown, homogenous, lobular adipose tissue covered by a thin membrane and uniform univacuolar and multivacuolated cells.
2. **Liposarcoma**: Ruling out is important due to the malignant potential, but less likely given the patient's histopathological findings suggesting benign characteristics.
3. **Paraganglioma**: Location in carotid space is a significant match; however, histopathologic findings are not consistent.
4. **Schwannoma**: Possible given location but less likely due to the consistency of the tumor described.
5. **Branchial cleft cyst**: Could be considered due to the neck mass location and fluctuation in size, but histopathology doesn’t support.
6. **Thyroglossal duct cyst**: Unlikely due to lack of attachment to the hyoid and histopathology.
7. **Lymphangioma**: Fluctuation fits but the fatty nature of the tumor doesn’t align.
8. **Carotid body tumor**: Fits the location, but inconsistency with histopathologic findings.
9. **Metastatic lymph node**: Benign lymph node findings decrease the likelihood.
10. **Fibromatosis**: Least likely given description and histopathology.

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old female patient presented with right nasal pain and radiating facial pain over the previous 3 years. She reported feeling a mass in her right nostril that had not changed in size, as well as associated nasal tenderness to the external nose, worsening pain with exposure to cold temperatures, and frequent sneezing. Prior to presentation, she had been prescribed fluticasone and loratadine for allergic rhinitis without resolution of symptoms. She denied difficulty breathing, epistaxis, rhinorrhea, fever, chills, weight loss, or night sweats. She was a nonsmoker and nondrinker. On physical examination, her external nose had no visible lesions. A rhinoscopy revealed normal mucosa with a submucosal, round, firm, tender lesion, measuring approximately 1 cm and located on the right anterior nasal septum. No drainage was visualized. Her turbinates appeared normal. The patient underwent surgical excision of the septal lesion under general anesthesia for definitive diagnosis. The specimen measured 1.1 × 0.7 × 0.2 cm and was erythematous, soft, vascular, and adherent, with a broad base to the anterior superior nasal septal mucosa just inferior to the upper lateral cartilage (Figure 1A and B). The lesion was excised down through the perichondrium. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Glomus tumor,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Nasal Septal Hematoma:** Given the submucosal, tender nature of the lesion and history of nasal trauma or surgery can be considered.
   
2. **Nasal Polyp:** Chronic nasal pain and palpable mass could suggest a benign polyp, though they usually aren't tender.

3. **Fibrous Dysplasia:** The firm, tender, and radiating facial pain might suggest a slow-growing dysplastic process, although less common in this location.

4. **Inverted Papilloma:** Typically these lesions arise from the lateral nasal wall, but could theoretically present with similar features.

5. **Chondroma:** The firm nature of the lesion and its attachment to cartilage could suggest this benign cartilage tumor.

6. **Sinonasal Schwannoma:** Typically painless, however, it might present with a firm mass.

7. **Pyogenic Granuloma:** Erythematous, vascular lesions that are tender and occur frequently in nasal passages.

8. **Benign Vascular Tumor (Hemangioma):** Erythematous, vascular nature suggests a benign vascular origin.

9. **Mucormycosis:** Rare but invasive fungal infection could present with submucosal lesions, though patients are typically immunocompromised.

10. **Granuloma (e.g., Sarcoidosis):** Chronicity and firm, non-healing mass suggest a granulomatous disease, though systemic symptoms often present.

### Reranking Based on Surgical Findings and Pathology Specimen:

1. **Pyogenic Granuloma:** The erythematous, vascular nature and tender mass fits the typical presentation.
   
2. **Benign Vascular Tumor (Hemangioma):** The erythematous and vascular nature could favor a diagnosis of hemangioma.

3. **Chondroma:** Firm and associated with cartilage, it could fit, though less likely given the vascular appearance.

4. **Granuloma (e.g., Sarcoidosis):** Chronic, firm mass fits but usually involves systemic symptoms which are absent.

5. **Nasal Septal Hematoma:** The tenderness and firm nature could coincide, however, the history typically involves trauma.

6. **Nasal Polyp:** Chronic nasal presentation and mass fit but usually aren't described as tender or vascular.

7. **Fibrous Dysplasia:** Firmness and chronicity fit but it lacks vascular characteristics.

8. **Inverted Papilloma:** Rare location for this type of lesion, despite the mass presence.

9. **Sinonasal Schwannoma:** Typically painless, and the vascular description is not characteristic.

10. **Mucormycosis:** Presentation makes it less likely as the patient is not immunocompromised and lacks other typical symptoms.

Given the pathology report showing an erythematous, soft, and vascular lesion, the most likely diagnosis from the list is **Pyogenic Granuloma**.","['Otolaryngology', 'Rhinology and Sinus Disease', 'Oncology', 'Soft-Tissue Tumors']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,F

### INPUT:
A 61-year-old man with a history of hypertension, psychosis, and recurrent venous thromboembolism was admitted to the emergency department with fatigue, weakness, and arthralgias after an unexplained fall. At presentation, he was experiencing psychosis and being treated in an inpatient psychiatric ward. He was nonadherent with medications and denied drug and alcohol abuse. On examination, he appeared comfortable. His blood pressure was 150/67 mm Hg; heart rate, 77/min; temperature, 36.7°C (98.1°F); respiratory rate, 16/min; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. On both lower extremities, there was peripheral edema with widespread hematomas, scattered ecchymosis, petechiae, and diffuse perifollicular purpura (Figure). The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Laboratory test results showed a normocytic anemia (hemoglobin level, 5.2 g/dL [reference, 13.5-17.5 g/dL]; mean corpuscular volume, 85 fL [reference, 80-100 fL]); normal platelet count (thrombocytes, 285 ×109/L [reference, 150-400 ×109/L]); and a mild leukopenia (leukocytes, 3.9 ×109 [reference, 4.3-10 ×109/L]). Folic acid level was low (3 nmol/L [reference, ≥5 nmol/L]) and vitamin B12 level was normal (478 pg/mL [reference, 193-982 pg/mL]). Results for iron panel, reticulocyte count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), international normalized ratio, liver function tests, and levels of indirect bilirubin, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and creatine kinase were all within reference range. Chest radiographs and computed tomography of the head were negative for any acute pathology. A 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed no abnormalities. Ultrasound of both lower legs showed no thromboembolism. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy),"To provide a comprehensive and systematic differential diagnosis, we will analyze one potential condition at each step based on the given clinical presentation and test results.

1. **Scurvy**: The presence of perifollicular purpura, ecchymosis, petechiae, and diffuse hematomas are suggestive of vitamin C deficiency.
2. **Folate Deficiency Anemia**: The patient’s low folic acid level and normocytic anemia align with folate deficiency anemia.
3. **Myelodysplastic Syndrome**: This condition could account for the combination of normocytic anemia, mild leukopenia, and the patient’s chronic medication nonadherence.
4. **Hemolytic Anemia**: Although less likely given the normal haptoglobin and unconjugated bilirubin levels, it could still explain anemia and fatigue.
5. **Chronic Kidney Disease**: This could cause anemia due to erythropoietin deficiency and explain the patient's overall weakness and fatigue.
6. **Hypersplenism**: Leading to sequestration and destruction of blood cells, which could present similarly with anemia and leukopenia.
7. **Iron Deficiency Anemia**: Presents with anemia, but given the patient’s normal iron studies, this is less likely but should still be considered.
8. **Chronic Liver Disease**: Can present with anemia and coagulopathies leading to bruising, though liver function tests here are normal.
9. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: Could explain the joint pain, anemia, low folic acid level, and multiple bruising/hematomas.
10. **Leukemia**: Although the patient has a normal platelet count and no significant leukocytosis, leukemia should be considered in the differential.

### Final Prioritized Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Scurvy**: Given the characteristic skin findings (perifollicular purpura, scattered ecchymosis, petechiae) and anemia, considering the possibility of dietary deficiency due to his psychiatric condition.
2. **Folate Deficiency Anemia**: The low folic acid level and normocytic anemia make this a strong consideration.
3. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: Compatible with anemia, arthralgias, and possible medication nonadherence.
4. **Myelodysplastic Syndrome**: Could be contributing to cytopenias with anemia and leukopenia in an elderly patient.
5. **Hypersplenism**: Could cause anemia, leukopenia, and possibly contribute to the psychological state.
6. **Chronic Kidney Disease**: Despite normal initial renal function tests, could be underlying.
7. **Iron Deficiency Anemia**: Normal iron results make this less likely but should still be considered.
8. **Hemolytic Anemia**: Normal haptoglobin and bilirubin levels make this less likely for anemia.
9. **Chronic Liver Disease**: Normal liver function tests reduce the likelihood.
10. **Leukemia**: Negative initial findings but should still be ruled out with a bone marrow biopsy if symptoms persist.

In the final assessment, we have prioritized conditions that fit both the clinical presentation and laboratory findings while considering the patient's history and overall health status.","['Dermatology', 'Emergency Medicine']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,61.0,M

### INPUT:
A 73-year-old African American woman was referred for the evaluation of a pigmented lesion on her left upper eyelid margin of 6 weeks’ duration. The patient first noted an erythematous, tender swelling with yellow discharge, which later evolved to the pigmented mass. Her ocular history was unremarkable. Her medical history revealed hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. On examination, her visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/30 OS. There was a sausage-shaped, darkly pigmented (black), focally ulcerated nodule involving the medial upper eyelid margin and measuring 8 × 6 × 4 mm. Associated madarosis, eyelid margin notching, and telangiectasia were noted (Figure 1). The remainder of the anterior segment and a dilated fundus examination were unremarkable. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pigmented basal cell carcinoma,"### Step 1: Seborrheic Keratosis
Seborrheic keratosis is a common noncancerous skin growth that often appears as a brown, black, or light tan growth and may be mistaken for malignant melanoma.

### Step 2: Basal Cell Carcinoma
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a type of skin cancer that arises from the basal cells and can present as a pigmented lesion, especially common in sun-exposed areas.

### Step 3: Malignant Melanoma
Malignant melanoma is a serious type of skin cancer that develops in the melanocytes, often presenting as a pigmented lesion that can be black or brown.

### Step 4: Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a type of skin cancer that arises from squamous cells, often presenting as a red, scaly, and sometimes ulcerated lesion.

### Step 5: Merkel Cell Carcinoma
Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare and aggressive skin cancer that appears as a fast-growing, painless nodule on sun-exposed skin.

### Step 6: Nevus
A nevus (mole) is a benign growth of melanocytes that may present as a pigmented lesion but can sometimes change and become symptomatic.

### Step 7: Dermatofibroma
Dermatofibroma is a common benign skin lesion, often presenting as a firm, pigmented nodule, usually asymptomatic and stable over time.

### Step 8: Pyogenic Granuloma
Pyogenic granuloma is a benign, rapidly growing vascular lesion that can appear as a red, oozing, and sometimes pigmented mass.

### Step 9: Kaposi Sarcoma
Kaposi sarcoma is a cancer that develops from the cells that line lymph or blood vessels and presents as pigmented lesions, often associated with HIV/AIDS.

### Step 10: Benign Lymphoid Hyperplasia
Benign lymphoid hyperplasia can present as a localized, non-cancerous proliferation of lymphoid tissue, which may appear as a nodule or mass.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis (Considering Patient Information and Test Results):

1. **Malignant Melanoma**
   - The rapid evolution and pigmented nature of the lesion, combined with its ulceration and associated telangiectasia, make melanoma a top consideration.

2. **Basal Cell Carcinoma**
   - The focal ulceration, pigmentation, and location on the eyelid margin are consistent with basal cell carcinoma features.

3. **Seborrheic Keratosis**
   - Despite being benign, the pigmented appearance and patient’s age lend this consideration, although the ulceration makes it less likely.

4. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**
   - The lesion’s ulceration and telangiectasia bring SCC into consideration, especially in older adults.

5. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma**
   - Though less common, its rapid growth and nodule formation are consistent with the presentation.

6. **Kaposi Sarcoma**
   - Given the pigmentation and nodular appearance, this can be considered, especially if patient history points towards immunocompromised status.

7. **Pyogenic Granuloma**
   - The initial erythematous and tender swelling aligns with early phases of pyogenic granuloma, despite less typical pigmentation.

8. **Nevus**
   - A changing pigmented lesion might start as a nevus but is less likely due to new, symptomatic development.

9. **Dermatofibroma**
   - Despite being a possibility, this benign condition is less likely due to the presented ulceration and rapid development.

10. **Benign Lymphoid Hyperplasia**
    - While a less likely scenario, it remains a differential until more definitive biopsy results are obtained.

From the clinical presentation, history, and ocular examination, these rankings focus on malignancies due to the alarming features of the lesion. A biopsy is recommended for a definitive diagnosis.","['Dermatology', 'External Eye Disease', 'Ophthalmology', 'Skin Cancer']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,73.0,F

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old Hispanic woman had a 3-year history of a steadily growing, increasingly pruritic, painless mass behind the right ear. The patient denied bleeding from the mass, ear pain, trauma, fever, fatigue, night sweats, or recent illnesses. Her medical history included eczema treated with triamcinolone acetonide cream. Otherwise, the patient had no family history or exposure to tobacco or alcohol. On physical examination, a 2-cm, nontender, mobile retroauricular mass with superficial excoriations was palpable over the right mastoid cortex. The patient had no hearing deficits and no fistula into the external auditory canal. There was no palpable head and neck lymphadenopathy. Serologic studies revealed an elevated absolute eosinophil count of 790/μL  (reference range, <700/μL; to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) and an eosinophilia percentage of 9.7% (reference range, <6.0%). The T1-weighted postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck showed a heterogeneously enhancing mass with irregular borders in the right retroauricular space, with a tract coursing anteriorly toward the parotid gland (Figure, A). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Kimura disease,"Sure, let's develop a differential diagnosis for the 31-year-old Hispanic woman based on her symptoms and test results.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Eosinophilic granuloma**
2. **Dermatofibroma**
3. **Epidermal inclusion cyst**
4. **Lymphoma**
5. **Lipoma**
6. **Dermoid cyst**
7. **Schwannoma**
8. **Paraganglioma**
9. **Mastoiditis**
10. **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Lymphoma** - Given the mass's irregular borders and enhancement on the MRI, lymphoma is a top consideration. While the patient does not report systemic symptoms commonly associated with lymphoma (fevers, night sweats), the absence of these symptoms does not rule out this condition.

2. **Eosinophilic granuloma** - The elevated eosinophil count suggests an eosinophil-related disorder. Eosinophilic granuloma can present as a localized mass and is consistent with the patient's lab results.

3. **Schwannoma** - The location of the mass near the nerve pathways and its characteristics on MRI may suggest a nerve sheath tumor like a Schwannoma.

4. **Dermoid cyst** - The tract seen on MRI may indicate a congenital origin like a dermoid cyst, which can have a longstanding presence and present similarly.

5. **Dermatofibroma** - As a benign skin lump, it could present pruritic and grow over time, though less common behind the ear.

6. **Epidermal inclusion cyst** - Typically painless and mobile, fits the clinical description, although the MRI characteristics make it less likely than other possibilities.

7. **Paraganglioma** - This is a neural crest tumor that could present as an enhancing mass on imaging.

8. **Lipoma** - While commonly painless and mobile, the MRI characteristics of the mass make this diagnosis less likely.

9. **Mastoiditis** - Usually associated with ear pain and systemic symptoms, which the patient does not have. However, the location behind the ear necessitates considering it.

10. **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis** - The patient's presentation is not typical, but eosinophilia and mass presence do suggest consideration of this rare condition.

### INPUT:
A 20-year-old woman was referred by her family physician to a community mental health team in London, United Kingdom. Her mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of her father. After a period living alone, she had returned to the family home 4 months prior to her presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. Her family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. Her family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to herself, expressing concerns about people meaning her harm, and professing the belief that she could hear other peoples’ thoughts. The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with her family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, her family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, she had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. She left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. She left this job about a year prior to her referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of her father. She was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness. On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and she presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. Her speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. She denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding her neighbors. She reflected that over the preceding few months, she had experienced a sensation of detachment from her immediate environment, as though it was not real, making her world similar to that of a video game. She reported that in the apartment where she had previously been living, she had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of her neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant her harm. She explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. She reported hearing her neighbors commenting negatively about her appearance. These distressing experiences prompted her to return to her family home, but she continued to hear her neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about her appearance and began to hear them commenting on her actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, her paranoia regarding her previous neighbors worsened, resulting in her rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and she reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of her experiences, she also saw the stress of losing her father as associated with her experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services.

9. **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) with Poor Insight**
10. **Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis with Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Schizophrenia**  
   - Hallucinations
   - Delusions (persecutory, control, reference)
   - Disorganized speech and behavior
   - Family history of schizophrenia
   - Duration of symptoms over 12 months
   
2. **Schizoaffective Disorder**  
   - Symptoms of schizophrenia plus mood disorder (depression)
   - Need to consider if mood episodes are present for the majority of the total duration

3. **Schizophreniform Disorder**  
   - Similar to schizophrenia but with a duration of symptoms over a shorter time frame (1 to 6 months)
   - The timeline of symptoms pointing towards longer duration favors schizophrenia

4. **Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features**  
   - Involves depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions)
   - The absence of marked depressive mood lowers its likelihood

5. **Delusional Disorder**  
   - Dominated by one or more delusions without prominent hallucinations, thought disorder, or negative symptoms
   - Delusions appear aligned with the persecutory subtype

6. **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**  
   - Involves re-experiencing, avoidance, hyperarousal following trauma
   - Background of war and asylum-seeking hints at trauma but lacks criteria timeline and avoidance symptoms

7. **Brief Psychotic Disorder**  
   - Psychotic symptoms lasting less than 1 month
   - The prolonged course (12 months) makes it less likely

8. **Bipolar I Disorder with Psychotic Features**  
   - Involves manic or mixed episodes with psychotic features
   - Absence of clear manic or hypomanic episodes lowers the likelihood

9. **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) with Poor Insight**  
   - Involves obsessions (intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors)
   - The nature of symptoms is more aligned with psychosis than typical OCD

10. **Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)**  
   - Instability in relationships, self-image, and affects, along with marked impulsivity
   - Symptoms like paranoid ideation or severe dissociation could present under stress

This reranked list considers the comprehensive details from the patient's history, noted symptoms, and the clinical presentation, stressing the differential diagnosis aligned with the chronicity and nature of everyday experiences, family history, and the nuanced psychotic features observed.","['Psychiatry and Behavioral Health', 'Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,20.0,F

### INPUT:
A woman in her 30s with a medical history of epilepsy and alcohol use disorder who was taking lamotrigine presented with severe head trauma. Her Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) was 11 M5V4E2 on admission, and a computed tomographic (CT) scan showed a right frontal epidural hematoma with a maximum thickness of 19 mm and a volume of 30 cm3 (Figure 1A). The hematoma was evacuated by neurosurgery, and her GCS improved to 14 postoperatively. On postoperative day 2, she developed isolated dysphagia and dysphonia. Laryngoscopic examination revealed right vocal cord paralysis (Figure 1B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cerebral vein thrombosis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Complications**
   - Epidural hematoma likely caused by the trauma.

2. **Vocal Cord Paralysis** 
   - Direct post-surgical trauma or edema affecting the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

3. **Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke)**
   - Potential postoperative stroke considering sudden postoperative neurological changes.

4. **Seizure**
   - Given history of epilepsy and possible post-traumatic or post-surgical seizures.

5. **Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome**
   - Given her history of alcohol use disorder and potential withdrawal during hospitalization.

6. **Vascular Injury**
   - Possible vascular injury causing cranial nerve dysfunction either from trauma or surgical intervention.

7. **Lamotrigine Side Effects**
   - Although less likely in this context, lamotrigine has been associated with neurological side effects.

8. **Brainstem Injury**
   - Unlikely but possible secondary injury involving the brainstem which can affect cranial nerves.

9. **Infection** 
   - Postoperative infection potentially causing new neurological deficits.

10. **Migraines**
    - Less likely but severe head trauma can sometimes trigger complex migraines with focal neurological signs.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on All Information and Test Results

1. **Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Complications**
   - Most likely due to initial severe head trauma and epidural hematoma, managed surgically with a noted initial improvement.

2. **Vocal Cord Paralysis**
   - Given the laryngoscopic confirmation of right vocal cord paralysis post-surgery.

3. **Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke)**
   - The sudden onset of new focal neurological deficits post-surgery raises concern for a stroke.

4. **Vascular Injury**
   - Possible surgical complication or consequence of initial trauma affecting cranial nerve pathways.

5. **Infection** 
   - Always a potential postoperative complication causing neurological changes.

6. **Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome**
   - Considering her history, withdrawal symptoms can present variably and add complexity to her condition.

7. **Brainstem Injury**
   - Less likely based on the CT findings but warrants consideration if other symptoms suggestive of this area arise.

8. **Seizure**
   - A history of epilepsy makes this a consideration but less likely for isolated dysphagia and dysphonia.

9. **Lamotrigine Side Effects**
   - Less likely but remains a differential given neurological symptoms and current medication.

10. **Migraines**
    - Least likely but considered if other causes are ruled out, given the history of head trauma.","['Otolaryngology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Neurology', 'Substance Use and Addiction Medicine']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30.0,F

### INPUT:
A 45-year-old woman was referred to a tertiary care center for hoarseness. She had a left vocal fold polyp that was removed 2 months earlier at an outside institution, with benign pathology reported. Subsequent stroboscopy revealed a hemorrhagic-appearing polyp (2-3 mm). She was sent for preoperative voice therapy, with plans for excision. However, her voice worsened with therapy, and she returned to the otolaryngology clinic after a few weeks. A larger, 6- to 7-mm, irregular, left vocal fold mass was noted. Preoperative imaging was nonspecific, revealing a small soft-tissue density along the true vocal fold. The patient was taken to the operating room for excision (Figure, A). After the final pathology results were obtained, the patient was taken back to the operating room for cordectomy with negative margins. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor,"Sure, let's break down the differential diagnosis step by step based on the given clinical presentation and findings.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Recurrent benign vocal fold polyp**
2. **Vocal fold hemorrhage**
3. **Vocal fold nodules**
4. **Vocal fold cyst**
5. **Laryngeal papillomatosis**
6. **Laryngeal carcinoma**
7. **Granulomatous disease of the vocal fold (e.g., tuberculosis)**
8. **Reinke's edema**
9. **Vocal fold granuloma**
10. **Autoimmune disease affecting the vocal fold (e.g., Wegener's granulomatosis)**

### Ranking After Consideration of All Patient Information and Test Results:
1. **Laryngeal carcinoma**: The rapidly enlarging, irregular mass, despite benign initial pathology, raises a high suspicion for malignancy.
2. **Recurrent benign vocal fold polyp**: Although the pathology was initially benign, recurrence or persistence can occur, especially if the initial excision was incomplete.
3. **Vocal fold hemorrhage**: Given the stroboscopy findings of a hemorrhagic appearance.
4. **Vocal fold cyst**: Less likely but can present with similar initial benign pathology and subsequent mass formation.
5. **Laryngeal papillomatosis**: Presents with irregular vocal fold lesions but typically has a characteristic appearance and recurrence pattern.
6. **Vocal fold nodules**: Usually bilateral but can be unilateral and complicated if not adequately managed.
7. **Vocal fold granuloma**: Can occur due to trauma or after surgery, including recurrent operations.
8. **Granulomatous disease (e.g., tuberculosis)**: Rare but can present with vocal fold masses and should be considered if there's no response to standard treatments.
9. **Autoimmune disease affecting the vocal fold**: Like Wegener's granulomatosis, it is rare but can present lesions in the vocal folds.
10. **Reinke's edema**: Presents differently but can cause voice changes and swelling, albeit more diffuse and less likely to form discrete masses.

This ranking considers the clinical course, the worsening of symptoms despite preoperative therapy, the pathology findings, and the need for cordectomy with negative margins, which suggests a more aggressive lesion like carcinoma.","['Laryngology', 'Otolaryngology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,45.0,F

### INPUT:
A 34-year-old man presented with headache, double vision, and seizures for 1 month and altered consciousness for 1 week. He had had 2 episodes of seizures that were characterized by tonic head and eye deviation to the left, followed by a brief period of tonic-clonic activity of all 4 limbs and postictal confusion for 10 to 15 minutes. He denied a history of fever, head trauma, limb weakness, or vomiting. He was a vegetarian, nonsmoker, and nondrinker. He denied a history of drug addiction. On examination, he was confused. He had facial flushing and grade III clubbing in his fingers and toes. His chest and cardiovascular examination results were normal. He had ptosis in his right eye. The right eye was deviated laterally secondary to right-medial rectus palsy. His pupil size and pupillary light reactions were normal. He also had grade II papilledema. His motor and sensory examination results were normal; however, he had brisk deep-tendon jerks and extensor planter responses. There were no meningeal signs. His cranial magnetic resonance image showed 2 ring-enhancing lesions in the right frontal and left parietal cortexes, along with surrounding brain edema and mass effects. Both lesions showed a thin-walled, contrast-enhancing rim with a central liquefaction (Figure, A). The central liquefaction showed restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pulmonary arteriovenous shunt,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Brain Abscess**: A brain abscess could present with headache, seizures, and ring-enhancing lesions on MRI.
2. **Metastatic Brain Tumors**: These can cause multiple brain lesions, seizures, and neurological deficits, and may show ring-enhancing lesions on imaging.
3. **Primary Brain Tumor (e.g., Glioblastoma Multiforme)**: Single or multiple lesions with mass effect and seizures are indicators.
4. **Neurocysticercosis**: Parasitic infection presenting with seizures and ring-enhancing lesions.
5. **Toxoplasmosis**: Typically seen in immunocompromised patients, presents with neurological symptoms and ring-enhancing brain lesions.
6. **Multiple Sclerosis**: While less likely due to the nature of the lesions, MS can present with various neurological symptoms.
7. **Tuberculoma**: Tuberculosis in the brain can present with ring-enhancing lesions and neurological symptoms.
8. **Brain Tumor (e.g., Meningioma)**: Generally shows as a solid mass but can sometimes present with mixed features on imaging.
9. **Lymphoma**: CNS lymphoma may present with seizures and ring-enhancing lesions, often in immunocompromised individuals.
10. **Encephalitis**: While less likely due to imaging, it can present with seizures and altered consciousness.

### Reranked Diagnoses

1. **Brain Abscess**: Most consistent with ring-enhancing lesions, central liquefaction, restricted diffusion, and neurological deficits.
2. **Toxoplasmosis**: Considered due to the presentation of ring-enhancing lesions, more common in immunocompromised but not excluded.
3. **Metastatic Brain Tumors**: Multiple lesions and neurological findings align well but less likely in absence of a primary known malignancy.
4. **Neurocysticercosis**: Possible due to ring-enhancing lesions and seizures, consider geographical and dietary history.
5. **Tuberculoma**: TB in the brain can mimic a brain abscess, but less likely in absence of systemic TB signs.
6. **Primary Brain Tumor (Glioblastoma Multiforme)**: Presents similarly but the central liquefaction and ring-enhancement less typical.
7. **Lymphoma**: Possible, especially if the patient has an undiagnosed immunocompromised condition.
8. **Encephalitis**: Less likely due to imaging findings, however, altered mental status fits.
9. **Brain Tumor (Meningioma)**: Less likely due to typical presentation and imaging findings.
10. **Multiple Sclerosis**: Unlikely due to imaging characteristics and acute presentation.

### INPUT:
An 11-day-old boy with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and unilateral renal agenesis presented with a right neck mass and intermittent inspiratory stridor present at birth. The patient did not require positive pressure or intubation, but he had intermittent stridor associated with desaturations. He had feeding difficulty and failure to thrive. On physical examination, the newborn had facial dysmorphism, including a broad and flat nasal dorsum and mild micrognathia. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed a cystic lesion consistent with a vallecular cyst. A modified barium swallow study demonstrated laryngeal penetration and aspiration of thin and nectar-thick liquids. A diffuse, soft, palpable mass was present along the right neck. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a multispatial mildly enhancing mass within the bilateral retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, and carotid spaces, with a mildly hyperintense signal relative to muscle on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and associated restricted diffusion. The mass was largest on the right side, with convex borders, mild superior displacement of the right parotid gland, and posterior displacement of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle (Figure, A, B). The T2-weighted MRI also demonstrated a hyperintense, nonenhancing lesion within the base of the tongue consistent with a vallecular cyst. The thyroid appeared normal and in its expected location, but no thymus was present in the mediastinum. The patient was taken to the operating room for excision of the vallecular cyst, and a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the right neck mass was performed for cytopathological analysis (Figure, C, D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Ectopic thymus,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Lymphatic Malformation (Cystic Hygroma)**
   - Given the physical examination findings of a diffuse, soft neck mass and MRI findings suggestive of a cystic structure, a lymphatic malformation, such as a cystic hygroma, should be considered.

2. **Congenital Neck Teratoma**
   - These masses can present at birth with neck swelling and respiratory distress. MRI characteristics such as multispatial involvement and varied signal intensities raise suspicion.

3. **Neuroblastoma**
   - Important to consider due to the age and presentation of a solid neck mass; neuroblastoma can present in the neck and be confirmed via fine-needle aspiration.

4. **Congenital Muscular Torticollis**
   - Although primarily affecting the sternocleidomastoid muscle, soft tissue swelling and a mass may be misleading.

5. **Infectious Cervical Lymphadenitis**
   - Any neck mass in a young child, particularly with systemic symptoms or fluctuating size, warrants considering an infectious etiology, especially with aspiration revealing inflammatory cells.

6. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**
   - These congenital anomalies typically present as neck masses in the pediatric population and can often be diagnosed via imaging and aspiration.

7. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**
   - Though typically midline, ectopic positioning near the hyoid bone can present unilaterally and shouldn't be discounted in congenital neck masses.

8. **Dermoid Cyst**
   - Often found in the head and neck region of young children, these cysts present as painless, non-tender masses that can be identified via MRI.

9. **Desmoid Tumor**
   - Although rare in infants, desmoid tumors can manifest as aggressive, fibrous growths in soft tissues, prompting consideration in unexplained masses.

10. **Hemangioma**
    - Common vascular tumors in infants, which can present as soft neck masses and usually exhibit characteristic MRI findings, such as high T2 signal intensity.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses

Based on all patient information and test results:
 
1. **Lymphatic Malformation (Cystic Hygroma)**
   - Compatibility with imaging and the clinical presentation of a multispatial, mildly enhancing neck mass.

2. **Congenital Neck Teratoma**
   - Differential given the complexity and extent of the mass evident on MRI.

3. **Neuroblastoma**
   - Potential due to the patient’s age and the presence of a significant neck mass.

4. **Branchial Cleft Cyst**
   - Likely given the congenital presentation and location of the neck mass.

5. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**
   - High on differential due to the congenital nature and MRI findings.

6. **Hemangioma**
   - Possible given patient age and characteristic MRI signals, albeit less definitive than higher-ranked possibilities.

7. **Dermoid Cyst**
   - Consistent with presentation and imaging but less likely than some top considerations.

8. **Infectious Cervical Lymphadenitis**
   - Considered but less likely absent systemic infection signs or significant inflammatory response.

9. **Desmoid Tumor**
   - Unlikely but included due to the nature of aggressive soft tissue tumors.

10. **Congenital Muscular Torticollis**
    - Least likely given the extensive nature and imaging characteristics of the mass.","['Neonatology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Pediatrics', 'Congenital Defects']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his 50s was referred to the dermatology clinic with a diagnosis of granuloma annulare made on the basis of prior skin biopsy results. He had been treated by a rheumatologist for polyarticular inflammatory arthritis involving the wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints, and proximal interphalangeal joints, as well as fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. Examination revealed numerous, pink-purple dermal papules on the trunk and extremities, with preference for the extensor surfaces of the arms (Figure, A) and legs. No lymphadenopathy was noted. The patient reported a 5- to 7-kg weight loss without fever or sweats. His pulmonary and joint symptoms were relieved by daily oral prednisone and flared with taper below 10 mg. Other medications prescribed included hydroxychloroquine, 400 mg, daily for 18 months and weekly adalimumab injections for 7 months, without improvement. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps

1. **Sarcoidosis**: Given the systemic symptoms, skin findings, and inflammatory arthritis, sarcoidosis should be considered.
2. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: Considering arthritis, skin manifestations, and general systemic involvement, SLE is a probable differential.
3. **Lymphoma**: Unexplained weight loss, dyspnea, and failure to respond to immunosuppressants could suggest an occult lymphoma.
4. **Dermatomyositis**: This disease involves proximal muscle weakness, skin changes, and can have systemic symptoms similar to those described.
5. **Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD)**: Arthritis, skin involvement, and systemic signs could be indicative of MCTD.
6. **Adult-Onset Still's Disease**: Characterized by arthritis and systemic symptoms such as weight loss and dyspnea.
7. **Interstitial Lung Disease with Connective Tissue Disease (CTD-ILD)**: Given the dyspnea and systemic inflammatory signs, an interstitial lung disease linked with connective tissue disorder might be suspected.
8. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)**: Systemic granulomatous inflammation affecting multiple organs, leading to arthritis and lung involvement.
9. **Reaction to Medication (e.g., Adalimumab)**: Side effects or reaction to long-term use of adalimumab could account for some of the symptoms.
10. **Rheumatoid Arthritis with Extra-Articular Manifestations**: Chronic arthritis causing systemic symptoms and skin involvement.

### Reranking of Differential Diagnosis

1. **Sarcoidosis**: This condition explains the dyspnea, systemic symptoms, skin manifestations, and arthritis; failed response to typical immunosuppressants used suggests a need for re-evaluation in this direction.
2. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: Common cause of systemic inflammation, arthritis, and skin lesions in middle-aged individuals.
3. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)**: Systemic vasculitis with respiratory involvement fits well with the symptoms described, including skin manifestations.
4. **Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD)**: The blend of symptoms (systemic, skin, arthritis) warrants this possibility.
5. **Dermatomyositis**: Skin lesions and systemic involvement, though less likely without proximal muscle weakness or specific dermatomyositis symptoms.
6. **Lymphoma**: Systemic symptoms and failed response to immunosuppressants, with weight loss being a significant red flag.
7. **Interstitial Lung Disease with Connective Tissue Disease (CTD-ILD)**: The significant pulmonary involvement alongside systemic symptoms makes this a strong candidate.
8. **Adult-Onset Still's Disease**: Systemic inflammation with arthritis, but less likely without characteristic fever and rash.
9. **Rheumatoid Arthritis with Extra-Articular Manifestations**: Chronic arthritis with additional symptoms, but less likely given the failure to respond to typical RA treatment.
10. **Reaction to Medication (e.g., Adalimumab)**: Though less likely entirely explaining the constellation of symptoms, the possibility of medication effect or reaction should be considered.

### OUTPUT:
    ",Erdheim-Chester disease,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis (Integrating Available Information):

1. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**
   - Reasons: Progressive numbness, involvement of multiple regions, MRI imaging potentially showing plaques/lesions typical of MS.

2. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)**
   - Reasons: Progressive motor symptoms including imbalance, hand incoordination.

3. **Cervical Spondylosis with Myelopathy**
   - Reasons: Progressive sensory and motor symptoms, potentially compressive lesions visible on MRI.

4. **Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS)**
   - Reasons: Upper motor neuron signs such as incoordination and imbalance.

5. **B12 Deficiency-Related Neuropathy**
   - Reasons: Although unremarkable levels, sometimes intermittent low levels or chronic deficiency symptoms precede laboratory changes.

6. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**
   - Reasons: Progressive neurological symptoms without primary malignancy identified yet that needs considering relevant history/workup.

7. **Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)**
   - Reasons: Progressive neurological symptoms, even though serum aquaporin-4 antibody is negative.

8. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Reasons: Chronic multi-system condition can present with neuropathy, central nervous system involvement might not reflect in systemic markers initially.

9. **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)**
   - Reasons: MRI changes significant for white matter disease, but usually associated in immunocompromised state.

10. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)**
    - Reasons: Progressive sensory and motor neuropathy, though CSF findings might be against this.

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**
   - Considering the MRI results and characteristic progressive nature.

2. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)**
   - Progressive neurodegenerative disease fitting the symptom pattern.

3. **Cervical Spondylosis with Myelopathy**
   - Common in the age group, fits the MRI indication and symptoms.

4. **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)**
   - Given symptomatic progression, consider despite the unremarkable HIV status.

5. **Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS)**
   - Upper motor neuron signs predominate that fit the description.

6. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Multi-system involvement possible with such neurological manifestations.

7. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**
   - Given the chronic progression, oncology work-up indicated.

8. **Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)**
   - Due to MRI findings.

9. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)**

A 33-year-old otherwise healthy black woman presented to the emergency department for evaluation of blurry vision in both eyes. She had no relevant medical, family, or ocular history. There was no history of trauma or ocular surgery. One month prior to presentation, she had developed fevers, chills, and coughing. After several days, she had developed redness, pain, photophobia, and blurry vision in her left eye, and she had subsequently developed similar symptoms in her right eye. On presentation, her visual acuity was counting fingers OU. Intraocular pressures were 14 mm Hg OU. A slitlamp examination revealed mild conjunctival redness, 2+ anterior chamber cell, and flare in both eyes, as well as mild posterior synechiae. The cornea was clear without keratic precipitates, and there were no iris nodules. Pigment was present on the anterior lens capsule. A fundus examination demonstrated a moderate amount of vitreous cell, hyperemia and edema of the optic disc, and retinal detachments in both eyes (Figure). The detachments were inferior and shifted with the patient’s head position, suggesting serous detachments. Findings were similar bilaterally.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Disease** - Classic presentation with bilateral serous retinal detachments, vitritis, and choroidal thickening. The demographic and symptomatology highly support VKH.
2. **Sarcoidosis** - Can present with similar ocular findings including uveitis, vitritis, and choroidal involvement, compatible with imaging findings.
3. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - Can present with uveitis and serous retinal detachment, but less commonly has diffuse choroidal thickening.
4. **Tuberculous Uveitis** - Presents with panuveitis but typically associated with more systemic signs and previous exposure history.
5. **Syphilitic Uveitis** - Can present with similar findings but would need a history of risk factors or positive serology.
6. **Post Viral Uveitis** - Secondary to recent febrile illness but less likely with the other suggestive signs.
7. **Acute Posterior Multifocal Placoid Pigment Epitheliopathy (APMPPE)** - Presents with posterior segment inflammation but less bilateral symmetrical in such acute presentations.
8. **Birdshot Chorioretinopathy** - Unilateral initially, less likely vitreous cells; the chronic course does not typically align with acute presentation.
9. **Sympathetic Ophthalmia** - History of ocular trauma or surgery is typically present, which this patient does not have.

A man in his mid-50s with no significant medical history was referred with 2 years of insidious exertional dyspnea and neck fullness. Examination of the jugular venous contour with the patient sitting upright at 90° is shown in Video 1. Auscultatory findings at the left lower sternal border showed normal S1 and S2 heart sounds with a diastolic sound and no murmurs (Figure 1; Video 2). Abdominal examination revealed an enlarged, pulsatile liver with smooth edges palpable 4 cm below the costal margin. Electrocardiography showed resting abnormalities (rightward axis and inferolateral T-wave inversions). Posteroanterior chest radiography showed normal heart size and clear lungs (Figure 1). Transthoracic echocardiography was performed, which showed normal left ventricular size and function without valvular abnormalities. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Constrictive pericarditis,"### Differential Diagnosis: Initial Working List

1. **Constrictive Pericarditis** - The presence of exertional dyspnea, neck fullness, abnormal jugular venous contour, pulsatile liver, and normal heart size on chest radiography suggest this possibility. The right heart findings of rightward axis and T-wave inversions also align.

2. **Right Heart Failure** - Symptoms and findings like exertional dyspnea, elevated JVP, and an enlarged pulsatile liver point towards this. The echocardiography findings argue against left heart failure but not right heart issues.

3. **Pericardial Effusion** - Presents with dyspnea and fullness, but typically would show on imaging and echocardiography; needs consideration despite the lack of suggestive imaging.

4. **Cor Pulmonale** - Chronic lung disease leading to right heart failure is plausible due to exertional symptoms and right-sided heart strain findings.

5. **Cardiac Tamponade** - While acute presentations are typical, chronic or subacute tamponade might show similar persistent signs of dyspnea and jugular venous distension.

6. **Tricuspid Valve Disease (e.g., tricuspid regurgitation)** - Dyspnea, elevated JVP with abnormal pulsation, and a pulsatile liver point to a right-sided valvular issue.

7. **Restrictive Cardiomyopathy** - Both symptoms and echocardiographic findings might be consistent with this, including no significant valvular abnormalities and preserved left ventricular function with right-sided involvement.

8. **Superior Vena Cava (SVC) Syndrome** - Considering neck fullness and elevated JVP, although it would usually cause more dramatic facial and upper extremity symptoms.

9. **Primary Liver Pathology (e.g., Hepatic Cirrhosis with Complications)** - Although less likely given the specific heart findings, liver issues could theoretically cause some similar systemic symptoms.

10. **Thyrotoxicosis with High-Output Cardiac Failure** - Can present with exertional dyspnea and generalized swelling due to heart failure, albeit with more systemic signs.

### Reassessment and Reranking of Differential Diagnosis

Considering the constellation of symptoms (exertional dyspnea, neck fullness, pulsatile liver), physical examination findings (jugular venous abnormalities, diastolic sound without murmur), imaging (normal heart size, clear lungs), and echocardiographic results (normal left ventricular size and function):

1. **Constrictive Pericarditis** - Highest likelihood given the combination of clinical signs, imaging, and echocardiographic findings typical for this chronic condition.
2. **Restrictive Cardiomyopathy** - Significant possibility given non-dilated ventricles with evidence of right-sided symptoms, making room for this diagnosis.
3. **Right Heart Failure** - The most plausible explanation for the right-ventricular strain and physical findings.
4. **Cor Pulmonale** - Still a considerable option given the presentation but less likelihood given no pulmonary pathology on chest radiograph.
5. **Pericardial Effusion** - Less likely without imaging findings to support significant effusion, but possible chronic subtle presentation.
6. **Tricuspid Valve Disease** - A reasonable differential but missed valvular abnormalities on imaging calls this into question.
7. **Cardiac Tamponade** - Chronic presentation could fit but less likely without traditional imaging findings.
8. **Superior Vena Cava (SVC) Syndrome** - Lower likelihood without distinct upper body symptoms.
9. **Primary Liver Pathology** - Unlikely given extensive focus on cardiac symptoms and indicator findings in history and examination.
10. **Thyrotoxicosis, High-Output Failure** - Least likely given absence of systemic symptoms typically associated with thyrotoxicosis.

This systematic approach and reranking based on additional assessments refine our differentials for more targeted diagnostic work and better patient management.",['Cardiology'],1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,55.0,M

### INPUT:
A 48-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 2-month history of progressive lower extremity weakness, sensory loss, and sphincter dysfunction. In the weeks prior to onset, she traveled to Yosemite National Park but denied any particular infectious exposures or symptoms including rash. She reported no personal or family medical history. Although she did consume a variety of nutraceuticals, she denied medication and recreational drug use. On examination, mental status, cranial nerves, and upper extremities were normal. Lower extremities were significant for her right side having greater pyramidal weakness than the left, with brisk reflexes and right ankle clonus, as well as a sensory level to pinprick at T6. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the total spine with and without gadolinium is seen in Figure 1. Initial investigations were notable for normal complete blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney and liver function, B12, and thyrotropin as well as an unremarkable MRI of the brain. Three lumbar punctures were performed over the course of the patient’s hospitalization, each with a white blood cell count less than 5 /µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), normal IgG index, absent oligoclonal bands, normal protein and glucose levels, and benign cytology. A comprehensive infectious and inflammatory workup including HIV, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, Lyme disease, antinuclear antibodies, astrocyte aquaporin-4 autoantibody, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein autoantibody, and serum and cerebrospinal fluid autoimmune panels were negative. Whole-body positron emission tomography demonstrated hypermetabolism of the midthoracic cord. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Glioma,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**
   - While her MRI of the brain was unremarkable and CSF studies did not indicate typical MS findings (e.g., oligoclonal bands), the progressive neurological deficits and hypermetabolism of the midthoracic cord on PET scan could suggest a spinal cord involvement in MS.

2. **Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS)**
   - This form of MS commonly presents with a progressive clinical course from onset, without relapses, and often involves the spinal cord more prominently.

3. **Transverse Myelitis**
   - Given the progressive weakness, sensory level at T6, and sphincter dysfunction, transverse myelitis would be a key consideration, especially idiopathic or parainfectious despite negative infectious workup.

4. **Spinal Cord Neoplasm**
   - Neoplastic processes (e.g., primary spinal cord tumors or metastasis) could present similarly, with localized MRI findings and hypermetabolism on PET scan.

5. **Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)**
   - Despite negative aquaporin-4 antibodies, NMOSD can still be considered, especially because it may present with longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions.

6. **Endemic Mycoses**
   - Fungal infections such as coccidioidomycosis, though rare, especially given exposure to different environments, could present with similar spinal cord involvement.

7. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Neurosarcoidosis can affect the spinal cord and may present with MRI findings and PET scan hypermetabolism, though other systemic signs might be absent initially.

8. **Vitamin E Deficiency**
   - This can cause progressive spastic paraparesis and sensory loss, though the normal nutritional panel makes it less likely.

9. **Paraneoplastic Myelitis**
   - Associated with underlying malignancies, this could explain MRI findings and clinical symptoms, even with normal initial screening.

10. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)**
    - It’s less likely given the significant sensory involvement and normal upper extremities, but ALS with primary lateral sclerosis could be considered.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
Taking into account her clinical presentation, significant neurological findings, MRI and PET results, and negative extensive workup, we can refine and rerank her differential diagnosis.

1. **Spinal Cord Neoplasm**
   - The combination of progressive symptoms, hypermetabolism on PET scan, and localized MRI findings strongly point towards a neoplastic process.

2. **Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS)**
   - Given the progressive course without relapses, PPMS remains a strong possibility, given its predilection for spinal cord involvement.

3. **Transverse Myelitis**
   - This remains a highly relevant differential given the clinical presentation with partial recovery of the inflammatory workup, suggesting a non-infectious etiology.

4. **Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)**
   - Although serum autoantibodies were negative, NMOSD can still be considered due to longitudinally extensive cord lesions.

5. **Sarcoidosis**
   - MRI and PET scan findings could indicate neurosarcoidosis, though the lack of systemic or pulmonary signs might push it lower in consideration.

6. **Endemic Mycoses**
   - Although less common and workup negative, the travel history necessitates this as a consideration; testing for uncommon fungal pathogens might be necessary.

7. **Paraneoplastic Myelitis**
   - Autoantibody testing and scans might not initially reveal underlying malignancies; continued surveillance is warranted.

8. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**
   - Typically expected clinical, radiological, and CSF findings in classic relapsing-remitting MS are absent.
   
9. **Vitamin E Deficiency**
   - Lacks supporting nutritional deficiency findings.

10. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)**
    - Unlikely, but not completely dismissible; normally typical features are inconsistent with current presentation. 

This detailed re-evaluation integrates clinical progression and extensive negative screening results, weighting neoplastic etiologies higher given current findings. Further investigation, such as biopsy or advanced imaging, would be critical for confirming a diagnosis.","['Neuro-oncology', 'Neurology', 'Oncology', 'Spinal Cord Disorders']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,48.0,F

### INPUT:
A 43-year-old African American man presented with a nontender, self-palpated mass in his left breast. He had hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity and was a current smoker. His medications included carvedilol, furosemide, lisinopril, metformin, and aspirin but no testosterone or herbal supplements. Family history was significant for a sister with brain cancer, diagnosed in her 40s. On physical examination, his vital signs were within normal limits; his body mass index, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, was 53. His left nipple was retracted. At the 2-o’clock position of the left breast, 3 cm from the nipple, there was a 3.5 × 3.0–cm firm mass. The right breast was normal without masses, and there was no palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. He underwent a bilateral diagnostic mammogram, which showed a partially obscured mass in the left upper outer quadrant with linear extension to the nipple (Figure, left panel). Targeted ultrasound showed a 2.0 × 1.6 × 1.6–cm irregular hypoechoic mass (Figure, right panel). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Male breast cancer,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Breast Cancer**: A firm mass in the breast with nipple retraction and an irregular hypoechoic mass on ultrasound raises suspicion for malignancy, particularly breast cancer.
   
2. **Gynecomastia**: The patient's obesity and medication profile, particularly with anti-hypertensives and anti-diabetic medications, could contribute to benign breast enlargement.

3. **Lipoma**: Given the firm consistency of the mass, a lipoma (a benign fatty tumor) could be considered.

4. **Breast Abscess**: Although the mass is nontender and the patient is afebrile, breast abscess generally presents with pain and signs of infection.

5. **Fibroadenoma**: Typically more common in younger women, but should be considered as a potential benign breast mass.

6. **Fat Necrosis**: Often follows trauma or surgery, which is not mentioned here, but should be included in differential diagnosis for a breast mass.

7. **Phyllodes Tumor**: This is a rare fibroepithelial tumor that can present as a rapidly growing breast mass.

8. **Intraductal Papilloma**: Usually presents with nipple discharge but can also present as a lump.

9. **Sarcoma of the breast**: This rare entity can present as a firm, rapidly growing mass.

10. **Hamartoma**: Although less common, considered in differential diagnoses involving benign breast masses.

### INPUT:
A 66-year-old man presented to the emergency department for painful and pruritic ulcerative cutaneous lesions involving his back, nose, lips (Figure, A), and mucosal lesions involving his oral cavity and oropharynx. The lesions initially only involved his lips and nasal bridge, and appeared 5 months prior while he was living on a ranch in Mexico. The lesions did not respond to treatment with an unknown oral antibiotic. His medical history included hypertension treated with captopril and a remote history of psoriasis. Physical examination demonstrated several dry, crusted skin lesions with blistering and ulceration, and shallow erythematous ulcerations of his oral mucosa. Internal medicine, otolaryngology, and dermatology departments were consulted. Results of flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy demonstrated erythematous and ulcerative lesions with surrounding leukoplakia involving the base of tongue, glossoepiglottic fold, lingual and laryngeal surfaces of the epiglottis, and aryepiglottic folds (Figure, C and D). A QuantiFERON-TB Gold test was obtained, and results were found to be positive. Serum antigen testing for blastomyces, histoplasmosis, syphilis, HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human herpesvirus 6, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella zoster virus, human polyomavirus 2, and West Nile virus were performed, and all results were found to be negative. A biopsy of the skin lesion was obtained from the edge of the lesion found on the patient’s back (Figure, B). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serological testing was subsequently performed, and results demonstrated elevated levels of antidesmoglein 1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and antidesmoglein 3 IgG. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pemphigus vulgaris,"Given the detailed patient information and test results provided, we can start to build a differential diagnosis step by step and rank them accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Pemphigus vulgaris**
   - Elevated antidesmoglein 1 IgG and antidesmoglein 3 IgG suggest an autoimmune condition targeting desmogleins, which is characteristic of pemphigus vulgaris.

2. **Tuberculosis (cutaneous)**
   - QuantiFERON-TB Gold positive and ulcerative cutaneous lesions might consider cutaneous manifestations of tuberculosis.

3. **Leishmaniasis**
   - History of living on a ranch in Mexico and ulcerative lesions suggest a parasitic infection, such as leishmaniasis.

4. **Lupus erythematosus (systemic)**
   - Autoimmune conditions, such as lupus, could manifest with mucocutaneous ulcers and might present with elevated autoantibodies.

5. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection**
   - Despite negative serology, clinical findings could still suggest HSV involvement especially with widespread mucocutaneous involvement.

6. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SJS/TEN)**
   - Extensive mucocutaneous involvement with blistering could potentially suggest SJS/TEN, though medication history lacks other triggers apart from hypertension treatment.

7. **Erythema multiforme**
   - Pruritic and ulcerative lesions with oral involvement could be indicative of erythema multiforme, typically following an infection.

8. **Psoriasis exacerbation**
   - Although less likely, a history of psoriasis could lead to exacerbation with unusual presentations, though more evidence is needed.

9. **Lichen planus**
   - Considerable mucosal involvement, particularly in the oral cavity, could raise suspicion for lichen planus.

10. **Candida infection**
    - Although usually seen in immunocompromised individuals, widespread ulceration and positive serology for other infections could hint at candidiasis.

### Rankings Based on Complete Information

1. **Pemphigus vulgaris** 
   - Strongly suggested by elevated antidesmoglein 1 and 3 IgG levels.
2. **Leishmaniasis**
   - Geographical history and ulcerative lesions support this.
3. **Tuberculosis (cutaneous)**
   - QuantiFERON-TB positive keeps TB high in consideration.
4. **Lupus erythematosus (systemic)**
   - Autoimmune profile consistent with systemic lupus.
5. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection**
   - Despite negative serology, wide mucocutaneous presentation inclines towards HSV.
6. **Lichen planus**
   - Oral involvement prominently.
7. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SJS/TEN)**
   - Extensive mucosal findings, kept lower due to lack of typical drug trigger.
8. **Erythema multiforme**
   - Similar presentation but lower likelihood given other more probable diagnoses.
9. **Candida infection**
   - Possible in light of widespread mucous lesions despite negative serology.
10. **Psoriasis exacerbation**
    - Remote history with unusual presentation and low on the list considering higher likelihood conditions.

### INPUT:
A healthy Asian man in his 20s presented with a 5-month history of progressive bilateral nasal obstruction. He also complained of recurrent epistaxis. He had no notable medical history except stable asthma. On physical examination, nasopharyngoscopy showed a pedunculated mass with a smooth mucosal surface arising from the roof of the nasopharynx. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging (Figure, A and B) revealed a midline, well-defined, pedunculated polypoid lesion with areas of calcifications in the nasopharynx, measuring approximately 1.2 × 1.5 × 2.0 cm. An endoscopic resection via retrovelar approach using a 70-degree endoscope combined with transnasal approach was performed under general anesthesia. The mass was completely resected with its stalk and with adequate surgical margin. Histopathological results (Figure, C and D) showed that the tumor cells were arranged in papillary structures with fibrovascular cores and these cells also had nuclear grooves. Results of other investigations after surgery were negative for cancer, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck and thyroid ultrasonography. In addition, no residual tumor or systemic metastasis was observed on positron emission tomography (PET)-CT results. There was no evidence of recurrence at 12-month postoperative follow-up.

An 81-year-old Mexican man was evaluated in the retina clinic for scattered subretinal lesions in the right eye. He complained of a gradual decline in his vision bilaterally over the past 2 years. He denied flashes, floaters, or eye pain but endorsed a chronic cough. He had no known ocular or medical history and took no systemic medications. He was born and raised in Mexico prior to his immigration to the United States 5 years before presentation. He worked as a farmer and denied recent illnesses, contacts with illnesses, alcohol or tobacco use, and having pets. His visual acuity was 20/60 OD and 20/40 OS with normal intraocular pressures. His slitlamp examination results were notable for mild nuclear sclerosis in both eyes and were negative for conjunctival or corneal lesions. He had round, reactive pupils and no anterior chamber inflammation in either eye. Dilated fundus examination results revealed a few pigmented anterior vitreous cells, a normal optic disc, and flat and large yellowish chorioretinal lesions with overlying pigment scattered throughout the macula and periphery in the right eye (Figure).

### OUTPUT:
    ",Ocular tuberculosis,"Alright, let's proceed step by step to develop a differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, taking into account the clinical findings and the patient's background.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Tuberculosis (Ocular)**: Considering the patient's chronic cough, subretinal lesions, and background from a TB-endemic region, tuberculosis must be considered.

2. **Toxoplasmosis**: Given the chorioretinal lesions, toxoplasma infection is a differential.

3. **Cysticercosis**: The patient's farming background and being from an endemic region makes cysticercosis a possibility.

4. **Histoplasmosis**: Endemic fungal infections like histoplasmosis should be considered, particularly since he lived in rural areas.

5. **Sarcoidosis**: Can present with ocular lesions and systemic symptoms, including a chronic cough.

6. **Syphilis**: Secondary or tertiary syphilis could present with ocular manifestations such as chorioretinitis.

7. **CMV Retinitis**: In an older patient with possible undiagnosed immunosuppression, CMV Retinitis could be a consideration.

8. **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**: Common in the elderly and presents with gradual vision loss and macular lesions.

9. **Ocular Lymphoma**: Can cause chorioretinal lesions and visual decline.

10. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Disease**: Autoimmune disorder with ocular manifestations, but often associated with systemic symptoms like skin changes.

### Re-rank Differential Diagnosis

Given all patient information and test results, let's re-rank the diagnoses considering the likelihood and clinical presentation:

1. **Tuberculosis (Ocular)**: High priority due to chronic cough, endemic region, and typical ocular findings.
2. **Cysticercosis**: Due to farming background and lesion appearance.
3. **Histoplasmosis**: Endemic region makes this fungal infection plausible.
4. **Toxoplasmosis**: Based on chorioretinal lesion presentation.
5. **Sarcoidosis**: Chronic cough and potential systemic involvement need consideration.
6. **Syphilis**: Always important to rule out due to treatability and diverse presentations.
7. **Ocular Lymphoma**: Needs consideration due to potentially similar appearance of lesions.
8. **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**: Common cause of visual decline.
9. **CMV Retinitis**: Less likely without known immunosuppression but still possible.
10. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Disease**: Lower on the list due to absence of other systemic signs.

This re-ranking considers the patient’s specific epidemiological background, occupational exposure, and clinical presentation in progressively ruling out each differential.","['Ophthalmology', 'Choroidal Disorders', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Tuberculosis', 'Intraocular Inflammation']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,81.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his 30s was referred to the department of Otorhinolaryngology–Head & Neck Surgery for a medical history of severe dysphagia and dysphonia. The patient reported fever and rhinorrhea in the few days preceding the emergency consultation. He did not take medication over the past 3 months. There was no relevant family medical history. At the clinical examination, the patient had several macules and desquamatory lesions on the mucosa of the oral cavity, lips, and penis, and he had hemorrhage lesions of the eye sclera (Figure). The skin of the patient was unremarkable. The nasofibroscopy results showed generalized desquamatory lesions of the upper aerodigestive tract mucosa affecting the laryngeal and vocal fold mucosa (Figure). There was no dyspnea and the airway was clear. The patient revealed that he had a similar but less severe clinical event 5 years previously. At that time, no diagnosis was found and the lesions disappeared following treatment with corticosteroids. Dermatopathologic analysis, biology, serology, and biopsy were performed. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Multiforme erythema,"Let's approach this case step-by-step, establishing a differential diagnosis considering the symptoms and findings described.

### Stepwise Differential Diagnosis

1. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)**
   - Severe dysphagia, dysphonia, mucosal desquamation, and hemorrhage points suggest a possible mucocutaneous disorder like SJS.

2. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**
   - The presence of desquamatory lesions in multiple mucosal sites, particularly with a history of similar past episodes, raises suspicion for an autoimmune blistering disorder like Pemphigus Vulgaris.

3. **Erosive Lichen Planus**
   - This condition can present with mucosal involvement and desquamatory lesions resembling the described symptoms.

4. **Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB)**
   - A genetic condition causing mucosal fragility and blistering could be considered, though typically it presents at birth or early childhood.

5. **Behçet's Disease**
   - Multisystem involvement including oral and genital ulcers along with ocular lesions can be indicative of Behçet's.

6. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection**
   - Recurrent oral and genital lesions could be HSV; however, the clinical presentation here is more extensive.

7. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
   - Mucosal involvement and systemic symptoms like fever can be seen in SLE, though skin sparing is unusual.

8. **Erythema Multiforme (EM)**
   - This condition can lead to mucosal involvement and is often associated with preceding infections.

9. **Syphilis**
   - presents with mucosal lesions and systemic symptoms, but typically involves skin as well.

10. **Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN)**
    - A severe, life-threatening reaction often overlapping with SJS, but typically involves the skin more extensively.

### Rerank All Differential Diagnoses

Based on the patient’s detailed symptoms, clinical findings, past medical history, and the nasofibroscopy results, the differential diagnoses can be reranked as follows:

1. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**
   - Most consistent with the pattern of mucosal lesions, history of past similar episodes, and response to corticosteroids.

2. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)**
   - Fits the acute presentation with generalized mucosal involvement, though the recurrence five years ago and absence of medication trigger are less typical.

3. **Behçet's Disease**
   - Oral and genital lesions plus ocular findings fit the pattern, systemic nature aligns with clinical presentation.

4. **Erosive Lichen Planus**
   - Fits the clinical presentation, though less likely due to the extensive mucosal desquamation in nasofibroscopy.

5. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
   - Mucosal involvement and systemic symptoms with fever fit the presentation, though skin sparing is less typical.

6. **Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB)**
   - Chronic mucosal fragility considered, though typically less likely due to the age of onset.

7. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection**
   - Recurrent lesions considered but extent of presentation is broader than typical HSV infections.

8. **Erythema Multiforme (EM)**
   - Preceding infection and mucosal involvement considered, less consistent with chronicity and previous episode.

9. **Syphilis**
   - Considered due to mucosal involvement but typically involves skin as well.

10. **Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN)**
    - Severe presentation, more likely with skin involvement which is absent here.

Thus, the primarily suspected diagnosis remains Pemphigus Vulgaris, given the recurring mucosal symptoms, physical examination correlates, response to corticosteroids, and overall clinical history.","['Laryngology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia', 'Dermatology', 'Cutaneous Drug Reactions']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,30.0,M

### INPUT:
An 81-year-old woman presented with a 30 cm-wide, easily bleeding, violaceous, cutaneous lesion of the left scapular region with a superinfected necrotic central portion surrounded by satellite telangiectatic papules (Figure, A). The patient first noticed a rapidly expanding, itchy, painful nodule, which measured 3 cm in diameter, 5 months prior to presentation (Figure, B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Merkel cell carcinoma,"Let's proceed with the differential diagnosis step by step, considering the information provided about the patient's presentation. Here's a structured approach to forming the differential diagnosis:

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Kaposi Sarcoma**: Given the violaceous lesion and the presence of telangiectatic papules, Kaposi Sarcoma is a consideration, especially as it can present with such skin findings.
 
2. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**: Although typically not presenting with such extensive lesions, the skin could have a large ulcerative, bleeding lesion given the patient's age.

3. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**: Considering the rapid growth and the necrotic central portion, SCC should be considered.

4. **Pyogenic Granuloma**: This can present as a rapidly growing red lesion that bleeds easily.
 
5. **Angiosarcoma**: This aggressive vascular tumor can present with violaceous lesions and ulceration.

6. **Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)**: Presented as a rash progressively turning into necrotic tumors.

7. **Bacillary Angiomatosis**: Especially in immunocompromised individuals; presents as vascular proliferative lesions.

8. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica Diabeticorum**: Usually associated with diabetes, presents with necrotic patches, though less common.

9. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma**: A highly malignant tumor that can present rapidly and appear violaceous.

10. **Cutaneous Metastases**: Secondary skin involvement from other primary cancers (like breast, lung, etc.) manifesting as skin lesions.

### Reranking Using All Provided Information:

Given the detailed history of the lesion's progression, characteristics, and appearance, the most likely differential diagnoses are:

1. **Angiosarcoma** - Fits very well with the rapid expansion, color, and ulcerative nature.
2. **Kaposi Sarcoma** - Violaceous color and telangiectatic papules support this diagnosis.
3. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)** - The rapid growth and central necrosis are suspicious.
4. **Cutaneous Metastases** - The extensive nature of the lesion should make us consider secondary malignancies.
5. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)** - Though typically less aggressive, large, and ulcerative BCC can be seen.
6. **Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides)** - The necrotic appearance supports this.
7. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma** - Given the aggressive feature, though less common.
8. **Bacillary Angiomatosis** - Possible, especially in an immunocompromised older individual.
9. **Pyogenic Granuloma** - Fits with easy bleeding but is less likely due to extensive growth.
10. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica Diabeticorum** - Least likely due to rarity and slower progression.

By considering all patient information and test results available so far, Angiosarcoma emerges as the most probable diagnosis, with Kaposi Sarcoma and SCC also strongly considered.","['Dermatology', 'Oncology', 'Geriatrics']",0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,81.0,F

### INPUT:
A 29-year-old healthy woman presented with a 2-month history of left-sided epiphora, headache, and facial pressure. A polypoid lesion was identified at the left lateral nasal wall. Noncontrasted computed tomography showed a hyperdense mass involving the left medial canthus extending through the nasolacrimal duct into the left nasal cavity. The patient underwent endoscopic left maxillary antrostomy, ethmoidectomy, and biopsy of mass, with results of pathology analysis showing poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was positive for cytokeratin 5/6 and p63, and negative for Epstein-Barr virus, p16, CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), and synaptophysin. The patient was referred to a tertiary care facility for further treatment. On examination, there was a palpable subcutaneous nodule 1 cm inferior to the left medial canthus with normal overlying skin. On nasal endoscopy, residual tumor was visible at the anterior aspect of the lateral nasal wall. Computed tomography showed postoperative changes with enhancement of left medial canthus extending into nasolacrimal duct and along the lateral nasal sidewall (Figure, A). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",NUT carcinoma,"### 10-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Poorly Differentiated Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**
   - The pathology analysis indicates poorly differentiated SCC, supported by positive IHC staining for cytokeratin 5/6 and p63.

2. **Inverted Papilloma**
   - Common nasal cavity lesion; can present with similar symptoms of nasal obstruction and epiphora but lacks the histological features of SCC.

3. **Adenocarcinoma**
   - Malignant glandular epithelial tumor; another differential for a mass in the nasal cavity but different histological and IHC profile.

4. **Esthesioneuroblastoma (Olfactory Neuroblastoma)**
   - Rare nasal cavity tumor; usually shows different immunohistochemical markers (e.g., positive for synaptophysin).

5. **Lymphoma**
   - Could present as a mass but negative CD45 makes this less likely.

6. **Sinonasal Undifferentiated Carcinoma (SNUC)**
   - Aggressive SCC variant; distinguished by a different IHC profile and histopathology.

7. **Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma**
   - Known for its association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), but negative EBV testing lowers this suspicion.

8. **Melanoma**
   - Rare in the nasal cavity but should be considered; lacks typical histological and IHC findings of SCC.

9. **Rhabdomyosarcoma**
   - More common in the pediatric population and presents differently on histopathology.

10. **Chordoma**
    - Rare, typically arises in spheno-occipital region and does not fit the provided IHC profile.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on Full Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Poorly Differentiated Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**
   - Confirmatory biopsy, radiographic features, and IHC staining align with this diagnosis. 

2. **Sinonasal Undifferentiated Carcinoma (SNUC)**
   - Similar aggressive nature to SCC but less likely due to IHC profile.

3. **Inverted Papilloma**
   - Polypoid nature makes it a differential; however, histology does not support.

4. **Adenocarcinoma**
   - Histopathologically different.

5. **Esthesioneuroblastoma (Olfactory Neuroblastoma)**
   - IHC profile inconsistent with neuroendocrine markers.

6. **Lymphoma**
   - Negative CD45 lowers the likelihood.

7. **Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma**
   - Negative for EBV makes it less likely.

8. **Melanoma**
   - IHC profile does not support.

9. **Rhabdomyosarcoma**
   - Uncommon in this patient demographic and histology.

10. **Chordoma**
    - Anatomical and histological considerations make it least likely.

Thus, the leading diagnosis remains poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma based on comprehensive data integration.","['Otolaryngology', 'Rhinology and Sinus Disease', 'Radiology', 'External Eye Disease', 'Ophthalmology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,F

### INPUT:
A healthy 30-year old man presented to the emergency department with facial trauma after an assault. Physical examination was notable for tenderness over the nasal bones. No neurologic deficits were noted. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head without contrast revealed nasal bone fractures and an incidental 7-mm tissue density within the posterior aspect of the left sphenoid sinus (Figure 1A) with an apparent dehiscence of the posterior wall and possible communication with the intracranial extra-axial spaces and brain parenchyma. A magnetic resonance imaging scan with contrast was recommended to further characterize the lesion which showed a transosseous T1 dark, T2 bright multilobulated mass measuring 2.1 × 1.4 × 1.3 cm with heterogeneous enhancement on postcontrast imaging extending into the sphenoid sinus. An endoscopic transnasal approach was used to obtain a tissue biopsy specimen. Pathological analysis revealed sheets of neoplastic, vacuolated, “soap bubble–like” cells with a myxoid background (Figure 1B).

6. **Lymphoma**
7. **Pituitary macroadenoma**
8. **Nasopharyngeal carcinoma**
9. **Olfactory neuroblastoma**
10. **Fibrous dysplasia**

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:
1. **Chordoma**: Given the location, radiologic features (heterogeneous enhancement, multilobulated mass), and histologic findings, chordoma is the most consistent diagnosis.
2. **Meningioma**: Could present with heterogeneous enhancement but the histology does not support this as strongly as chordoma.
3. **Adenocarcinoma**: Less likely due to the characteristic histology of ""soap bubble-like"" cells, which does not typically describe adenocarcinoma.
4. **Schwannoma**: Typically less associated with bone involvement and the given histologic findings.
5. **Sinusitis-related mucocele**: The mass’s characteristics on imaging suggest a neoplasm rather than an inflammatory process or mucocele.
6. **Lymphoma**: Can affect paranasal sinuses but the appearance on imaging and histologic features are less consistent.
7. **Pituitary macroadenoma**: Not usually presenting with the described histological cells and often has a more specific sellar location.
8. **Nasopharyngeal carcinoma**: Could involve the sphenoid sinus but does not align as well with the histologic findings or mass characteristics.
9. **Olfactory neuroblastoma**: Could present with similar imaging features but histology is not typical.
10. **Fibrous dysplasia**: This primarily affects bone density and does not usually present with the described neoplastic characteristics.

### Conclusion:
Based on the complete analysis of imaging features, lesion characteristics, and histologic findings, a **chordoma** is the most consistent and likely diagnosis for the patient.","['Otolaryngology', 'Rhinology and Sinus Disease', 'Trauma and Injury']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,30.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his 40s with a 5-year history of mildly pruritic poikilodermatous patches and thin plaques involving the bilateral axilla and groin presented with expanding lesions on both flanks. He had not received any prior treatment for the lesions. On examination, there were hypopigmented and hyperpigmented reticulated patches and thin, atrophic plaques covering more than 10% of the total body surface area involving the axilla, groin, and flanks bilaterally (Figure, A). No cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy was noted. Results from a comprehensive review of systems was unremarkable. Results from a complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and blood chemistry analyses were normal. A 6-mm punch biopsy specimen from the right flank was obtained for histopathological examination (Figure, B). Immunohistochemical analysis was also performed (Figure, C and D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Mycosis fungoides,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Mycosis Fungoides**
   - Reasoning: The presentation of pruritic poikilodermatous patches, atrophic plaques, and specific body site involvement is highly suggestive of this type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

2. **Lichen Planus**
   - Reasoning: Chronicity and the presentation of atrophic plaques could be indicative, though it typically involves mucosal surfaces and wickham's striae.

3. **Chronic Dermatitis (Eczema)**
   - Reasoning: Chronic pruritic dermatitis could present with similar features, though typically more inflammatory and responsive to treatment.

4. **Tinea Versicolor**
   - Reasoning: The distribution and hypopigmentation could suggest a fungal infection, usually more superficial with a fine scale.

5. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Reasoning: Cutaneous sarcoidosis can present with variable lesions, though often with systemic involvement, which is absent here.

6. **Secondary Syphilis**
   - Reasoning: Presents with a variety of skin rashes and lesions, usually with systemic symptoms and positive serology, absent in this case.

7. **Parapsoriasis**
   - Reasoning: Chronic, scaly patches that persist could denote this, often a precursor or mimicker of mycosis fungoides.

8. **Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus**
   - Reasoning: Photodistributed patches and plaques could suggest this, though systemic lupus indicators are absent.

9. **Pagetoid Reticulosis**
   - Reasoning: Considered due to persistent skin lesions that have clonal T-cell populations, part of the spectrum of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas.

10. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica**
    - Reasoning: Typically associated with diabetes but can present with atrophic plaques, mainly on the shins rather than intertriginous areas.

### Re-Ranked Differential Diagnoses Using All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Mycosis Fungoides**
   - Strongest fit given the chronicity, examination findings, and atrophic patches consistent with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

2. **Parapsoriasis**
   - Persistent, scaly patches common in this, clinically similar to early mycosis fungoides.

3. **Lichen Planus**
   - Chronic condition with atrophic plaques, though typically involves mucosal surfaces more predominantly.

4. **Pagetoid Reticulosis**
   - Uncommon but notable for clonal T-cell populations, persistent lesions resembling lymphoma.

5. **Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus**
   - Chronic cutaneous presentation without systemic symptoms, less likely but considered.

6. **Chronic Dermatitis (Eczema)**
   - Common chronic dermatosis though usually more inflammatory and less atrophic in presentation and often responsive to basic treatments.

7. **Tinea Versicolor**
   - Fungal infection with hypopigmented patches, not fitting the chronicity and systemic features noted.

8. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Potential given cutaneous involvement but rarely isolated without systemic symptoms.

9. **Secondary Syphilis**
   - Presents variable rashes with systemic symptoms usually, unremarkable review of systems and serology makes it less likely.

10. **Necrobiosis Lipoidica**
    - Chronic atrophic plaques but localized more typically to lower legs, associated with diabetes which is not mentioned.

### INPUT:
A woman in her early 60s with a medical history of chest pain requiring a coronary angiogram (which demonstrated only mild luminal irregularities) approximately 1 year prior to presentation, hypertension, long-standing dyslipidemia, and multiparity presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of dull, pressurelike chest pain radiating to the left arm. The pain started at rest, was 10 of 10 in severity, and was not alleviated by changing position. She also experienced concomitant nausea and diaphoresis. Her family history was notable for hypertension, and no other systemic diseases were reported. On physical examination, her blood pressure was 115/76 mm Hg, heart rate was regular at 72 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation level was 98% on room air. The patient was afebrile. Physical examination also revealed mild bibasilar crackles and jugular venous distention, and no murmurs or lower extremity edema. Laboratory test results demonstrated an elevated troponin, and the 12-lead electrocardiogram showed marked ST-segment elevations in leads V2 to V5 (Figure, A). The ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) pager was activated, and the patient was transferred urgently to the catheterization laboratory. Coronary angiography of the patient’s left anterior descending coronary artery was performed, and the findings are depicted in the Figure, B. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Spontaneous coronary artery dissection,"### Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)**: Classic symptomatology of chest pain radiating to the arm, elevated troponin, and ST-segment elevation on ECG consistent with STEMI.

2. **Unstable Angina**: Despite the stand-alone diagnosis of AMI, unstable angina is another consideration given her symptomatology and partial relief with rest.

3. **Aortic Dissection**: Given the intense chest pain and radiation to the arms, this needs to be considered as a critical differential.

4. **Pulmonary Embolism**: Sudden chest pain and dyspnea can be manifestations of a PE, though typical ECG changes for PE are absent.

5. **Pneumothorax**: Sudden onset of pain with potential respiratory implications should keep this on the list, though typically associated with decreased breath sounds.

6. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**: Although uncharacteristic, GERD can sometimes mimic cardiac pain, especially given her symptom duration and type.

7. **Panic Attack**: Sudden onset of chest pain with accompanying symptoms, though typically would expect more evident psychological triggers.

8. **Pericarditis**: Sharp chest pain radiating to the arm with ECG changes, but usually presents with friction rub and different ECG findings.

9. **Esophageal Spasm**: Mimics cardiac chest pain and may present similarly, but less likely given radiation and associated ST changes on ECG.

10. **Musculoskeletal Pain**: Less likely but can mimic cardiac pain particularly in stress-induced scenarios.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on Complete Information:
1. **Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)**: Most consistent with elevated troponin and ST-segment elevations.
2. **Unstable Angina**: Less likely than AMI but considered due to pain characteristics.
3. **Aortic Dissection**: Remains high due to severe chest pain but less likely with cardiac-specific findings.
4. **Pulmonary Embolism**: Though less likely given primary cardiac findings, remains critical differential.
5. **Pericarditis**: Lower likelihood compared to cardiac ischemia presented but considered.
6. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**: Unlikely but kept for completion of differential.
7. **Pneumothorax**: Unlikely with observed findings but retained for differential completeness.
8. **Esophageal Spasm**: Unlikely given the presentation and ST findings.
9. **Panic Attack**: Considered very unlikely given the severity and nature of pain and findings.
10. **Musculoskeletal Pain**: Least likely of differentials but included for thoroughness.

### INPUT:
A 51-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and nephrolithiasis presented to the emergency department with left flank and left upper quadrant abdominal pain. He stated that “I think I have a kidney stone blocking my kidney” but denied nausea, vomiting, fever, dysuria, hematuria, or weight loss. He had no history of chronic abdominal pain. Past surgical history was noteworthy for emergency exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy for blunt trauma 14 years prior. Physical examination revealed a comfortable-appearing patient in no acute distress. His temperature was 36.8°C; pulse, 77/min; and blood pressure, 125/86 mm Hg. Abdominal palpation elicited only mild epigastric tenderness without masses or rebound. There was no costovertebral angle tenderness. Laboratory data revealed normal levels of serum urea nitrogen and creatinine and normal liver function. A complete blood cell count showed leukocytosis (15 300/μL with 54% neutrophils, 38% lymphocytes, 8% monocytes); hemoglobin level, 15.5 g/dL; and hematocrit, 45.2%. Urinalysis revealed no red or white blood cells and was negative for leukocyte esterase and nitrate. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a well-circumscribed mass with a small focus of central high density resulting in surrounding streak artifact (Figure 1). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Gossypiboma (retained surgical sponge),"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Renal Cell Carcinoma** - Given the patient's history of nephrolithiasis and the presentation of a well-circumscribed mass in the CT scan raises high suspicion for renal cell carcinoma.
  
2. **Adrenal Adenoma** - The CT finding of a well-circumscribed mass with areas of high density could also be compatible with an adrenal adenoma, especially in a patient with a known history of hypertension.
  
3. **Angiomyolipoma** - Another potential differential for a well-defined, heterogeneous mass in the kidney area could be angiomyolipoma, a benign renal tumor.
  
4. **Renal Abscess** - Although the patient denies fever and chills, a renal abscess could present as a mass, often with surrounding streak artifact on imaging.
  
5. **Retroperitoneal Fibrosis** - This can present with a mass effect and flank pain, sometimes related to a history of prior surgery (such as splenectomy).
  
6. **Lymphoma** - Given the leukocytosis and a well-defined mass, lymphoma should also be considered in the differential.
  
7. **Metastatic Disease** - A metastasis from a primary cancer (such as lung cancer) could present as a mass in the context of no clear primary renal pathology.
  
8. **Splenosis** - After the splenectomy, splenosis (autotransplantation of splenic tissue) could present as an unusual mass in the abdomen.
  
9. **Primary Psoas Muscle Abscess** - Although less likely given lack of significant systemic symptoms, a psoas muscle mass could be possible.
  
10. **Pancreatic Pseudocyst** - Given the location of the upper quadrant pain and imaging findings, a pancreatic pseudocyst could be a differential.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on Full Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Splenosis** - The patient's history of splenectomy and the CT finding fit well with the possibility of splenic tissue autotransplantation (splenosis).
2. **Renal Cell Carcinoma** - High suspicion remains due to the mass and the patient's history of nephrolithiasis.
3. **Adrenal Adenoma** - Hypertension and imaging findings are consistent with this diagnosis.
4. **Angiomyolipoma** - This benign renal tumor remains a possibility due to the imaging characteristics.
5. **Lymphoma** - Leukocytosis and a well-defined mass make lymphoma a differential to keep in mind.
6. **Metastatic Disease** - Should be considered given the mass and a background of known underlying risk factors.
7. **Renal Abscess** - While less likely due to the lack of infection symptoms, it remains in the differential.
8. **Retroperitoneal Fibrosis** - Possible given the patient's past surgical history, though less likely without a more suggestive clinical history.
9. **Pancreatic Pseudocyst** - May be less likely based on physical exam and lack of history of pancreatitis.
10. **Primary Psoas Muscle Abscess** - Least likely due to lack of significant systemic symptoms.","['Surgery', 'Radiology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,51.0,M

A 60-year-old woman with a history of Lyme disease presented with polydipsia and polyuria and received a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results revealed a thickening and enhancement of the pituitary gland, stalk, and hypothalamus. The abnormal imaging findings improved on subsequent MRIs without treatment. Surveillance pituitary MRIs remained stable. Four years later, MRI results (Figure) revealed bilateral T1 and T2 low-intensity intraconal soft tissue masses with avid enhancement on postcontrast images. The optic nerves were encased with no evidence of infiltration of the nerves, vascular structures, or extraocular muscles. She reported the sensation of eye fullness and denied pain. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Her pupils were symmetric and responded to light and near effort; there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. The results of testing with an Amsler grid and Ishihara color plates were normal. Her visual fields were full to confrontation. The optic nerves and retina were normal bilaterally. There was bilateral periorbital swelling and proptosis. Exophthalmometry measurements on a base of 92 were 17 mm on the right and 19 mm on the left. Applanation tonometry results were 12 mm Hg on the right and 15 mm Hg on the left. Extraocular motility examination results revealed substantial (−3) deficits in both eyes. The remainder of the neurologic examination results were normal.

8. **Thyroid Eye Disease (Graves' Orbitopathy)**
9. **Neurosarcoidosis**
10. **Pituitary Adenoma**

### Re-ranked Differential Diagnosis Utilizing All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **IgG4-Related Disease**
   - This disease is characterized by inflammatory masses that can affect multiple organs, including the pituitary gland and orbits, matching the patient’s MRI and clinical findings.
   
2. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH)**
   - LCH can present with pituitary gland involvement and cause diabetes insipidus. The orbital masses seen on MRI and the pituitary abnormalities could fit into the spectrum of LCH.

3. **Lymphocytic Hypophysitis**
   - Given the pituitary involvement improving on imaging without treatment, an autoimmune inflammatory process like lymphocytic hypophysitis is plausible, yet less commonly associated with such prominent orbital masses.
   
4. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Sarcoidosis can affect the central nervous system and orbital tissues, marked by granulomatous inflammation which could explain the findings noted on the MRI.

5. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome**
   - It's an inflammatory condition affecting the cavernous sinus and orbit. The improvement without treatment could point to a self-limiting inflammatory disorder, though Tolosa-Hunt typically presents with pain.

6. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**
   - This granulomatous vasculitis can cause both pituitary and orbital involvements. Given her presenting symptoms and imaging, it remains a differential.

7. **Lymphoma**
   - Primary central nervous system lymphoma could present with these imaging findings, but the lack of systemic symptoms or rapid progression might make it less likely.

8. **Neurosarcoidosis**
   - Although there was already a consideration for general sarcoidosis, neurosarcoidosis specifically involves nervous system manifestations, standing alone as a differential in complex cases.

9. **Thyroid Eye Disease (Graves' Orbitopathy)**
   - While it commonly presents with proptosis and extraocular muscle involvement, its presentation doesn't typically include the pituitary or extensive hypothalamic changes noted.

10. **Pituitary Adenoma**
    - While this could cause pituitary thickening on MRI, it’s less commonly associated with such significant orbital findings noted.

He had been diagnosed a year earlier with HIV infection and hepatic tuberculosis. Baseline CD4 count was 7 cells/μL, and following treatment with HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) consisting of dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate, he achieved full virological suppression; however, CD4 counts remained low at 31 cells/μL. He had completed 12 months of directly observed therapy with ethambutol, moxifloxacin, and rifabutin—a liver-sparing regimen—owing to toxic effects from the first-line regimen 1 month prior to admission. Physical examination revealed evidence of perforation of the hard palate (Figure, A). A computed tomographic scan of the chest revealed necrotic lymph nodes, and a palatine biopsy was performed (Figure, B and C). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Histoplasmosis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Esophageal Candidiasis** - Given the HIV diagnosis, dysphagia, and low CD4 count, oral/esophageal candidiasis is a strong possibility.
  
2. **Kaposi's Sarcoma** - Known HIV infection with a low CD4 count and weight loss: potential involvement of mucosal surfaces including the palate.
  
3. **Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma** - Dysphagia, weight loss, HIV infection with low CD4 count, and necrotic lymph nodes on imaging.
  
4. **Histoplasmosis** - HIV with low CD4 counts, necrotic lymph nodes, and systemic symptoms like weight loss.
  
5. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection** - Severe immunosuppression, could involve multiple organs leading to similar symptoms.
  
6. **Tuberculosis Relapse** - Given history of hepatic TB and immunocompromised state, potential relapse with atypical presentation.
  
7. **Tertiary Syphilis** - Expanded stage involving palate perforation, dysphagia, and weight loss.
  
8. **Invasive Aspergillosis** - HIV with low CD4 count, possibilities of atypical infection involving different body parts including the palate.
  
9. **Cryptococcosis** - Severe immunosuppression, weight loss, and potential systemic effects.
  
10. **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)** - Severe immunocompromised state, though more likely to present with neurological symptoms primarily, systemic spread could be considered.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Esophageal Candidiasis** - Most common in severe immunosuppression (CD4 count 31 cells/μL), especially with dysphagia.
  
2. **Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma** - Highly possible with persistent immunosuppression and presentation including necrotic lymph nodes.
  
3. **Histoplasmosis** - Consistent with systemic symptoms and commonly seen in advanced HIV.
  
4. **Kaposi's Sarcoma** - Considered because of low CD4 count, weight loss, and involvement of mucosal surfaces but less common.
  
5. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection** - Could account for multi-organ involvement including the palate and systemic symptoms.
  
6. **Cryptococcosis** - Given severe immunosuppression and systemic symptoms, though less commonly involving palate perforation.
  
7. **Tuberculosis Relapse** - Possible but less likely given recent completion of DOT therapy; consider if testing supports.
  
8. **Invasive Aspergillosis** - Less common but must consider with immunocompromised status and atypical infection presentation.
  
9. **Tertiary Syphilis** - Rare, but consistent with palate involvement; RPR/FTA-ABS would help confirm.
  
10. **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)** - Lower likelihood but remains a differential in a highly immunosuppressed state with systemic spread.","['Infectious Diseases', 'HIV', 'Otolaryngology', 'Swallowing and Dysphagia', 'Fungal Infections']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,45.0,M

### INPUT:
A woman in her 60s with a history of end-stage renal disease who had a kidney transplant 9 months previously presented with progressive cough, dyspnea, and hoarseness. Her history also included chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and a 14-pack-year smoking history. She initially presented 3 months prior with upper respiratory symptoms, which continued to worsen despite oral antibiotic therapy. Her cough became productive with white, frothy phlegm that was accompanied by fever, wheezing, hoarseness, and fatigue. Her dyspnea worsened in the supine position. Flexible laryngotracheoscopy results revealed diffuse, white-to-yellow pseudomembranous changes involving the glottis and supraglottis (Figure, A), posterior tracheal wall, and left mainstem bronchus with skip lesions in the subglottis and distal 1 cm of the trachea (Figure, B). Glottic mobility was limited in both abduction and adduction with substantial airway obstruction. Computed tomographic findings revealed posterior tracheal wall thickening with the loss of the fat plane between the trachea and esophagus, and a moderate to severe obstruction within the distal left mainstem bronchus. Biopsy results are shown in Figure, C. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Aspergillosis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Airway fungal infection (e.g., Aspergillosis):** Given the patient's immunocompromised state post-kidney transplant, fungal infections are a concerning possibility.
2. **Tracheobronchial papillomatosis:** Characterized by respiratory symptoms and pseudomembranous changes; often caused by HPV.
3. **Respiratory papillomatosis:** Related to repeated smoking history and presenting with hoarseness and airway obstruction.
4. **Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD):** As the patient is post-kidney transplant, PTLD should be considered.
5. **Chronic rejection of the transplanted kidney:** Although primarily affecting the kidney, could also have systemic manifestations.
6. **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR):** History of chronic GERD can lead to secondary respiratory issues.
7. **Bronchogenic carcinoma:** 14-pack-year smoking history raises concern about malignant transformation.
8. **Invasive bacterial tracheobronchitis:** Persistent upper respiratory symptoms unresponsive to antibiotics could suggest a complicated bacterial infection.
9. **Wegener’s granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis):** Due to its impact on airways and possible pseudomembranous inflammation.
10. **Sarcoidosis:** Known for causing non-caseating granulomas that can affect the airways and other tissues.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD):** Given the immunosuppressed state, history, and diffuse airway changes.
2. **Airway fungal infection (e.g., Aspergillosis):** Immunocompromised patients are at a higher risk; diffuse pseudomembranous changes are suggestive.
3. **Respiratory papillomatosis:** The presentation aligns with the history of smoking and hoarseness.
4. **Bronchogenic carcinoma:** Smoking history compels consideration of malignancy.
5. **Invasive bacterial tracheobronchitis:** Persistent symptoms despite antibiotic treatment; pseudomembranous findings can be seen.
6. **Wegener’s granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis):** Diffuse airway lesions; could explain systemic findings.
7. **Sarcoidosis:** Granulomatous involvement of the airway; less likely but possible.
8. **Tracheobronchial papillomatosis:** Although less common in the elderly, consistent with airway obstructive symptoms.
9. **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR):** History of GERD with respiratory symptoms aligns, but other causes seem more likely.
10. **Chronic rejection of the transplanted kidney:** Less likely to cause direct airway manifestations but remains in consideration for systemic involvement.","['Otolaryngology', 'Transplantation', 'Laryngology', 'Nephrology', 'Renal Replacement']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,60.0,F

### INPUT:
A 59-year-old Hispanic woman presented with a 6-month history of intermittent pain in the right posterior mandibular gingiva. Her local dentist had prescribed an antibiotic and performed a tooth extraction in the area 6 months prior with no improvement in symptoms. Ultimately, her pain became persistent and radiated to the right lower lip. She had a history of stage IV endometrial serous adenocarcinoma (ESA) 4 years prior that was treated with total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and peritoneal lavage. She had developed a recurrence for which she had just completed 3 cycles of treatment with carboplatin. She also had a history of anxiety, hypertension, and pterygium, and she was taking gabapentin, lorazepam, prochlorperazine, metoprolol succinate, bromfenac and ketorolac ophthalmic solution, and aprepitant. Intraoral examination revealed a 1.5 × 1.0-cm firm, erythematous gingival mass in the area of missing right mandibular second bicuspid and first molar with buccal and lingual expansion (Figure 1A). The right mandibular first bicuspid was grade 3 mobile. A periapical radiograph was obtained, and results showed a diffuse, poorly demarcated radiolucency measuring approximately 1.2 × 0.8 cm (Figure 1B). Findings from an incisional biopsy of the mass showed an infiltrative tumor (Figure 1C). Tumor cells were positive for CK7, PAX8, and WT-1, and negative for CK20 and TTF-1 (Figure 1C, inset). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Oral metastasis,"Based on the provided patient history, clinical findings, imaging results, and biopsy reports, let’s develop a 10-Step differential diagnosis:

1. Metastasis from Endometrial Serous Adenocarcinoma (ESA)
2. Primary gingival squamous cell carcinoma
3. Osteosarcoma of the jaw
4. Lymphoma of the oral cavity
5. Ameloblastoma
6. Central giant cell granuloma
7. Chronic osteomyelitis
8. Paget’s disease of bone
9. Oral tuberculosis
10. Peripheral ossifying fibroma

Now, let's rank these differentials considering all the available patient information and diagnostic test results:

1. **Metastasis from Endometrial Serous Adenocarcinoma (ESA)**:
   - Strong history of stage IV ESA with recurrence.
   - Tumor cells positive for CK7, PAX8, and WT-1 are indicative of endometrial origin.

2. **Primary gingival squamous cell carcinoma**:
   - Common oral malignancy with similar presentation but less likely given the specific marker profile.

3. **Lymphoma of the oral cavity**:
   - Has a gingival mass presentation but less likely due to the immunohistochemistry profile.

4. **Osteosarcoma of the jaw**:
   - Radiographic findings can mimic; however, less likely without classical sunburst pattern and specific markers.

5. **Ameloblastoma**:
   - Significant due to its local aggressive nature; however, the histological profile does not align.

6. **Central giant cell granuloma**:
   - Radiolucency can be similar, but it is less likely given the lack of giant cells in biopsy.

7. **Chronic osteomyelitis**:
   - A possible infectious etiology which fits; however, less likely due to the biopsy results.

8. **Paget’s disease of bone**:
   - Typically has a different clinical presentation and radiographic findings.

9. **Oral tuberculosis**:
   - Rare and less likely without systemic signs and classic histopathological findings.

10. **Peripheral ossifying fibroma**:
    - Presents as a gingival mass but tends to be more localized and histologically different.

Final Diagnosis: **Metastasis from Endometrial Serous Adenocarcinoma (ESA)** is the most likely diagnosis given the relevant history, clinical presentation, radiographic findings, and most importantly, the biopsy results showing immunohistochemical markers indicative of ESA origin.","['Head and Neck Cancer', 'Otolaryngology', 'Dental Medicine']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,59.0,F

### INPUT:
A woman in her 30s presented with a 1-year medical history of a painless, slowly enlarging, midline neck mass without associated dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, or history of infection. The mass was soft, mobile, and compressible in midline level IA, measuring 7 cm and posterior-superiorly displacing the tongue. The mass was visible as a clear blue lesion in the floor of the mouth and was nontender. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the neck with IV contrast was performed (Figure). The patient was taken to the operating room for a successful combined intraoral and transcervical approach to excision. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Epidermoid cyst,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst (TGDC)** - Given the location, midline neck mass, painless enlargement, and mobility.
2. **Dermoid Cyst** - Soft, mobile mass in the midline neck region, commonly in young adults.
3. **Epidermoid Cyst** - Slow-growing, painless, compressible, and presents as a blue lesion.
4. **Lymphatic Malformation (Cystic Hygroma)** - Soft, compressible mass, possible translucency.
5. **Ranula** - Translucent, blue lesion in the floor of the mouth.
6. **Branchial Cleft Cyst** - Typically lateral, but midline cases have been reported.
7. **Ectopic Thyroid Tissue** - Thyroid gland may present as ectopic tissue in the neck.
8. **Lipoma** - Soft, mobile mass, generally slow-growing.
9. **Plunging Ranula** - Extension into the neck from the floor of the mouth.
10. **Mucocele** - Painless, cystic lesion in mouth floor.

### Reassessment & Reranking based on additional patient information and CT scan results:

1. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst (TGDC)** - Primary consideration given classic midline positioning, mobility, and appearance.
2. **Dermoid Cyst** - Differential similar presentation in young adult, midline location.
3. **Epidermoid Cyst** - Blue lesion correlates but somewhat lower likelihood than top 2.
4. **Ranula** - Blue lesion on the floor of mouth convinces of relationship.
5. **Plunging Ranula** - Given size and growth pattern, likely extension in multiple planes.
6. **Lymphatic Malformation (Cystic Hygroma)** - True midline, compressible aligns with description; lower probability.
7. **Ectopic Thyroid Tissue** - Considered due to thyroid movement potential up thyroglossal tract.
8. **Branchial Cleft Cyst** - Typically lateral but persisted due to similar presentations.
9. **Lipoma** - Less likely due to usual deeper presentation and absence of characteristic feel.
10. **Mucocele** - Least likely because of typical presentation in minor salivary glands, minimal mass growth.

### INPUT:
A preschool boy presented with asymptomatic, reddish, raised lesions over his right ear, noticed 3 months earlier, associated with multiple painless swellings on the ipsilateral side of the neck for the past 3 weeks. On examination, there were multiple, erythematous papules coalescing to form a plaque with areas of scarring over the posterior aspect of right ear, along with firm, nontender posterior cervical lymphadenopathy (Figure, A). There was no history of trauma or intervention prior to the onset of lesions. His medical history was unremarkable, as were the rest of the mucocutaneous and systemic examination findings. A skin biopsy from the plaque was submitted for histopathological examination (Figure, C and D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Lupus vulgaris,"Certainly, let's develop a differential diagnosis step by step:

**Step 1:** Cutaneous Tuberculosis  
**Step 2:** Sarcoidosis  
**Step 3:** Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis  
**Step 4:** Cat Scratch Disease  
**Step 5:** Atypical Mycobacterial Infection  
**Step 6:** Tinea Capitis (Kerion)  
**Step 7:** Leprosy  
**Step 8:** Lupus Vulgaris  
**Step 9:** Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans  
**Step 10:** Hodgkin's Lymphoma  

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses Considering All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Atypical Mycobacterial Infection**  
   - Rationale: Multiple painless cervical lymphadenopathies and chronicity without systemic symptoms are highly suggestive.
   
2. **Cutaneous Tuberculosis**  
   - Rationale: The chronic nature and characteristic plaque could be indicative of a form of cutaneous TB.
   
3. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**  
   - Rationale: Red, scaly lesions along with lymphadenopathy are common in LCH.
   
4. **Sarcoidosis**  
   - Rationale: Erythematous papules and lymphadenopathy fit the presentation, although sarcoidosis is less common in young children.
       
5. **Cat Scratch Disease**  
   - Rationale: Lymphadenopathy following a scratch or bite, but no mention of such history here.
   
6. **Lupus Vulgaris**  
   - Rationale: The chronic plaque-like lesion with scarring fits this chronic form of cutaneous TB.
   
7. **Leprosy**  
   - Rationale: Though rare, it presents with skin lesions and nerve involvement, less likely given the patient's presentation.
   
8. **Hodgkin's Lymphoma**  
   - Rationale: Lymphadenopathy fits the description, but the skin manifestations are not typical.
   
9. **Tinea Capitis (Kerion)**  
   - Rationale: Raised, inflamed lesions over the scalp regions could indicate Kerion, but cervical lymphadenopathy isn't as common.
   
10. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans**  
    - Rationale: While it can present with skin lesions, the presentation and associated lymphadenopathy make it a less likely fit.

### INPUT:
A 70-year-old Indian woman presented with a generalized rash over the lower extremity associated with pedal edema extending up to the shins. The onset was gradual and started on the lower extremities and gradually extended to involve the lower trunk. The rash was associated with mild discomfort. The patient denied itching, weeping, or bleeding from the rash. She denied any constitutional symptoms (weight loss, fever, night sweats), joint pains, history of blood in urine, periorbital edema, and recent intake of medications or herbal medications. Social history was significant for 25 pack-years of smoking. Physical examination revealed multiple well-defined, coalescent, erythematous, palpable, purpuralike lesions that were predominantly present over the trunk and lower extremities (Figure, A and B). Laboratory test results at presentation included a hemoglobin level of 11.2 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10), mean corpuscular volume of 84 fL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 72 mm/h, and a lactate dehydrogenase level of 412 IU/L. Hepatic and renal function levels were within normal limits. Complement levels were normal. Hepatitis B and C and HIV profiles were negative. A chest radiograph showed a 2-cm lesion in the upper lobe of the left lung. A computed tomographic scan of the chest showed a spiculated mass in the same region along with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. An ultrasound of the abdomen showed bilateral adrenal masses. A lesional skin biopsy specimen was obtained (Figure, C). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis,"To construct a differential diagnosis for the presented case, consider both dermatologic and systemic causes given the skin findings and additional systemic manifestations (lung mass, adrenal masses). Here is a step-by-step differential diagnosis process:

### 1. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)
- CTCL can present with erythematous patches and plaques, and given the patient's age, a biopsy can confirm this.

### 2. Metastatic carcinoma
- The lung mass and adrenal masses are suggestive of metastatic disease, which can also present with paraneoplastic syndromes like rashes.

### 3. Small vessel vasculitis (e.g., leukocytoclastic vasculitis)
- Purpuralike lesions and elevated ESR could signify vasculitis affecting dermal capillaries.

### 4. Chronic venous insufficiency
- Given the pedal edema and predominantly lower extremity involvement, consider venous stasis dermatitis.

### 5. Drug-induced rash
- Despite the patient denying recent medication intake, any previous medications should still be considered; biopsies can often reveal drug-related pathology.

### 6. Paraneoplastic syndrome
- The lung and adrenal masses might indicate an underlying malignancy, which can have paraneoplastic dermatologic manifestations.

### 7. Sarcoidosis
- Sarcoidosis can present with skin lesions and is frequently associated with lung findings and can occasionally involve adrenal glands.

### 8. Amyloidosis
- Systemic amyloidosis can present with purpuralike lesions and involvement of multiple organs including skin and adrenal glands.

### 9. Infective endocarditis
- Potential embolic phenomena could cause rash and systemic symptoms, with a source being a lung abscess or misdiagnosed mass.

### 10. Secondary syphilis
- Presents with generalized rash and can have various systemic involvements including adrenal gland involvement, though less likely due to the patient's history and lack of sexual history provided.

### Reevaluation and Reranking Based on Full Patient Data and Test Results:

1. **Metastatic carcinoma**: Most likely considering lung mass, adrenal masses, and potential paraneoplastic rash.
2. **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)**: Rash presentation consistent, further confirmation with skin biopsy.
3. **Paraneoplastic syndrome**: Linked to metastatic carcinoma, presenting with systemic dermatologic manifestations.
4. **Small vessel vasculitis**: Considered due to elevated ESR and purpuralike lesions; yet less likely given systemic findings.
5. **Chronic venous insufficiency**: Considered but less likely due to systemic and biopsy findings.
6. **Sarcoidosis**: Possible given systemic distribution and lung involvement.
7. **Amyloidosis**: Possible explanation for multi-organ involvement and skin lesions.
8. **Infective endocarditis**: Less likely without fever, heart murmur, or positive blood cultures.
9. **Drug-induced rash**: Less likely as patient denies recent intake, but cannot be entirely ruled out.
10. **Secondary syphilis**: Less likely without supportive serology or sexual history.

### INPUT:
A man in his 50s presented with an abdominal skin eruption of 2 days’ duration. His medical history included hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and an orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) 3 years prior that was subsequently treated with tacrolimus, 5 mg, and mycophenolate, 750 mg, twice daily. Approximately 2½ years after the transplant, the patient developed gastric outlet obstruction secondary to an infiltrative gastric wall mass. The gastric wall mass was found to be associated with plasmablastic posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (pPTLD). He was subsequently instructed to stop use of mycophenolate and decrease use of tacrolimus to 0.25 mg daily, then treated with 1 cycle of CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone) and lenalidomide, resulting in symptomatic and radiologic improvement. Five weeks after treatment with CHOP chemotherapy, the patient presented with an acute-onset abdominal skin eruption without fever or pain. A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed possible abdominal wall cellulitis, so treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin was empirically started. Physical examination revealed confluent indurated violaceous papules and plaques coalescing into an annular pattern encircling the healed OLT incisional scar with central sparing (Figure 1A). A 4-mm punch biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathological evaluation (Figure 1B and C) and bacterial and fungal cultures. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder,"Certainly! Let's go through the differential diagnosis step by step.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Tacrolimus-induced skin lesions**: Considering his immunosuppressive medication.
2. **Cutaneous lymphoma**: History of posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder.
3. **Pyoderma gangrenosum**: Associated with systemic conditions, requires clinical correlation.
4. **Drug eruption**: Recent chemotherapy agents can cause skin reactions.
5. **Infection (Bacterial or Fungal)**: Due to immunosuppression and empirical antibiotic treatment.
6. **Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)**: Though rare in organ transplants compared to bone marrow.
7. **Leukocytoclastic vasculitis**: Can present with cutaneous manifestations.
8. **Kaposi sarcoma**: Associated with immunosuppressed states.
9. **Sweet syndrome**: Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis.
10. **Erythema multiforme**: Potentially associated with infections or drugs.

### Reranking with All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Cutaneous lymphoma**: Given his history of lymphoproliferative disorder (pPTLD) and immunosuppression.
2. **Drug eruption**: Recent exposure to new medications (CHOP chemotherapy).
3. **Infection (Bacterial or Fungal)**: Presenting with new skin lesions and under immunosuppression.
4. **Pyoderma gangrenosum**: Consistent with systemic chronic conditions and need for clinical correlation.
5. **Kaposi sarcoma**: Less likely but needs consideration given immunosuppression.
6. **Sweet syndrome**: Possible but no fever reported.
7. **Tacrolimus-induced skin lesions**: Chronic use of immunosuppressive drug.
8. **Leukocytoclastic vasculitis**: Possible, needs confirmation via histopathology.
9. **Erythema multiforme**: Typically follows infections or drug administration, less probable based on presentation.
10. **Chronic GVHD**: Least likely given organ transplant rather than bone marrow transplant and far out from transplant date.

### INPUT:
A 75-year-old woman was referred to the ophthalmology clinic for evaluation of double vision and a droopy left upper eyelid. Over the previous 5 months, the patient had experienced gradual onset of binocular, horizontal diplopia and ptosis of the left upper eyelid. There were no neurological deficits and no pain. Her symptoms were constant, without fluctuation during the day. There was no history of trauma or prior surgery of the eye. Her medical history was notable for hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Family history was positive for hypertension in her mother, prostate cancer in her father, and ductal carcinoma in situ in her daughter. She was a current daily smoker at presentation. An ophthalmologic examination revealed a visual acuity of 20/25 OD and 20/30 OS. Pupillary, intraocular pressure, and dilated fundus examinations were unremarkable. Abduction was severely restricted in the left eye, but it did not elicit pain, and extraocular muscle movements were otherwise full. There was substantial resistance to retropulsion of the left eye. Bilateral blepharoptosis, with more severity on the left side, was noted. The margin-to-reflex distance 1 was 2 mm on the right and 0 mm on the left. A 3.5-mm left enophthalmos was noted compared with the right side, and there was hollowing of the left superior sulcus. Testing of cranial nerves V and VII were unremarkable. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Infiltrating lobular breast carcinoma,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps
1. **Orbital Tumor**: The presence of substantial resistance to retropulsion and enophthalmos suggests possible mass effect.
2. **Myasthenia Gravis**: Ptosis and diplopia being common but fluctuating symptoms associated with myasthenia.
3. **Thyroid Eye Disease**: Characterized by restrictive ophthalmopathy and changes in extraocular muscles.
4. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)**: Presents with chronic, progressive ptosis, and ophthalmoplegia.
5. **Third Cranial Nerve Palsy**: Diplopia and ptosis are classic signs, even though pupillary involvement is typically present.
6. **Horner Syndrome**: Ptosis and enophthalmos can be subtle signs.
7. **Orbital Myositis**: Inflammatory condition causing eye movement restriction, often painful.
8. **Diabetic Cranial Nerve Palsy**: Diabetes can cause isolated cranial nerve palsies, often third or sixth.
9. **Ocular Myositis**: Inflammation restricted to the extraocular muscles.
10. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation**: Non-specific inflammation of the orbital content with no identifiable cause.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis Re-evaluation
1. **Orbital Tumor**
   - Suggested by the substantial resistance to retropulsion, enophthalmos, and hollowing of the superior orbital sulcus.
   - Order imaging (MRI/CT) to assess for any mass.
   
2. **Thyroid Eye Disease**
   - Given the presence of restrictive eye movement and enophthalmos; consider thyroid function tests and orbital imaging.
   
3. **Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)**
   - Progressive nature without pain, consistent ptosis and diplopia, but less probable due to enophthalmos.
   
4. **Myasthenia Gravis**
   - Diplopia and ptosis could be present but typically would have fluctuating symptoms and less orbital involvement.
   
5. **Third Cranial Nerve Palsy**
   - Rule out due to lack of pupillary involvement and constant symptoms.
   
6. **Horner Syndrome**
   - Ptosis, anhidrosis, and miosis usually present; enophthalmos might be too exaggerated.
   
7. **Diabetic Cranial Nerve Palsy**
   - Possible due to diabetes history, but less likely without acute onset and classic symptoms.
   
8. **Orbital Myositis**
   - Excludes due to the absence of pain and inflammatory signs.
   
9. **Ocular Myositis**
   - Unlikely without inflammatory findings.
   
10. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation**
   - Potential differential if no specific pathology is identified through imaging and lab tests.

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old African swimmer presented with a 1-month history of progressive left hearing loss and vertigo. He also reported asthenia, sleep disorders, and urinary frequency. The urinary frequency has been treated for 2 years with many drugs (tamsulosin, desmopressin, and solifenacin) without improvement. The patient had spent his childhood in eastern Africa, where he swam in Lake Tanganyika. His history did not reveal trauma, infection, or any other associated conditions at the onset of the complaints. The ear, nose, and throat examination revealed a right horizontal nystagmus and a poorly delineated hypoesthesia of the left pinna. He could not walk properly owing to his vertigo. The rest of the clinical examination findings were unremarkable. Additional examinations (ie, pure-tone audiometry, video nystagmography, tympanometry) revealed left profound hearing loss with an air-bone gap of 40 dB and central vertigo. Otoacoustic emissions were absent on the left side. There was no left acoustic reflex. Auditory brainstem responses showed asymmetric interpeak latencies of waves I through V and III through V, suggesting slower conduction on the left side. Computed tomography and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 24 × 20-mm hemorrhagic lesion in the left middle cerebellar peduncle associated with a thickening of the cochleovestibular nerve (Figure). The patient was referred to urology, where a 13 × 8-mm mass was discovered in the lateral wall of the prostate gland. Biopsies of prostate and brain lesions, blood tests, and urinalysis were performed. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Schistosomiasis,"Let's work through a step-by-step differential diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and findings.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Vestibular Schwannoma (Acoustic Neuroma)**
   - Progressive unilateral hearing loss, vertigo, and MRI findings suggesting nerve thickening.

2. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**
   - Symptomatic central nervous system lesion and a concurrent prostate mass, indicating likely systemic nature of the disease.

3. **Metastasis to the Brain (Secondary Brain Tumor)**
   - Hemorrhagic brain lesion associated with a primary malignancy in the prostate.

4. **Schistosomiasis**
   - History of swimming in Lake Tanganyika and urinary symptoms, considering the endemic nature of schistosomiasis in Africa.

5. **Multiple Sclerosis**
   - Central vertigo, asymmetric auditory brainstem responses, and a lesion in the cerebellar peduncle.

6. **Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma**
   - MRI findings of a hemorrhagic lesion in the cerebellar peduncle.

7. **Meniere's Disease**
   - Symptoms of vertigo and hearing loss, although the MRI findings make this less likely initially.

8. **Prostate Cancer with Neuroendocrine Differentiation**
   - Unexplained symptoms of urinary frequency and a mass in the prostate, suggesting more aggressive or unusual types of prostate cancer.

9. **Labyrinthitis**
   - Vertigo and hearing loss, although less likely with the described findings on imaging studies.

10. **Cerebrovascular Event (Stroke)**
    - Acute presentation of dizziness, vertigo, and the MRI findings, though no sudden onset which makes this lesser likely.

### Reranking Based on Full Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Metastasis to the Brain (Secondary Brain Tumor)**
   - Hemorrhagic lesion in the brain and a primary prostate mass highly suggest metastatic disease.

2. **Paraneoplastic Syndrome**
   - Neurologic symptoms and concurrent prostate cancer suggest a paraneoplastic process.

3. **Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma**
   - The imaging characteristics and lesion location support this diagnosis.

4. **Schistosomiasis**
   - Considering endemic regions and the persistent urinary symptoms, although less likely related to brain lesion.

5. **Vestibular Schwannoma (Acoustic Neuroma)**
   - Progressive hearing loss and nerve thickening, although hemorrhagic component is less characteristic.

6. **Prostate Cancer with Neuroendocrine Differentiation**
   - Unusual glioma-related symptoms paired with prostate mass.

7. **Multiple Sclerosis**
   - The imaging and neurologic findings can be suggestive but less likely without typical multiple lesions or dissemination in time.

8. **Cerebrovascular Event (Stroke)**
   - May account for some presenting symptoms but does not fit well with gradual progression.

9. **Meniere's Disease**
   - Persistent vertigo and hearing loss but lacks imaging support.

10. **Labyrinthitis**
    - Unlikely with the described MRI findings and central vertigo.

In conclusion, metastasis to the brain secondary to prostate cancer emerges as the leading hypothesis based on the integrated clinical, radiological, and histopathological findings.","['Infectious Diseases', 'Otolaryngology', 'Audiology and Hearing', 'Vestibular Disorders', 'Otology']",0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,46.0,M

### INPUT:
A white man in his 70s presented with a gradually enlarging right supraorbital mass that had been neglected for 4 years. His comorbidities included congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and a 50-pack-year history of tobacco abuse. Physical examination revealed a firm, nonmobile, nontender, bulging mass situated over the right frontal sinus, which expanded to the upper right eyelid. The mass covered the globe completely, resulting in total vision obstruction (Figure, A). However, the patient’s vision remained intact when the mass was elevated off the eye with great effort. His right pupil was round and reactive to light without afferent pupillary defect. No palpable lymphadenopathy was noted. A non–contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a large, right supraorbital mass with bony destruction of the anterior table of the right frontal sinus (Figure, B). It extended into the superior aspect of the orbit, displacing the right globe inferiorly. Air was seen within the mass (Figure, C). A fine-needle aspiration biopsy yielded inconclusive results. After medical clearance, the patient was taken to the operating room for a wedge excisional biopsy with decompression of the right supraorbital mass under monitored anesthesia care. Histopathological investigation revealed large nests of neoplastic epithelioid cells surrounded by fibrotic tissue and necroinflammatory debris. The neoplastic cells contained round nuclei with single prominent nucleoli and abundant clear to vacuolated cytoplasm (Figure, D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Sebaceous carcinoma,"### 10-Step Differential Diagnosis Process

1. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**
   - Given the patient's history of long-term sun exposure, neglected mass, and the typical presentation of a non-tender, gradually enlarging tumor, BCC is a significant consideration.

2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**
   - Considering the patient's prolonged tobacco abuse history and the destructive nature of the mass seen in CT scans, SCC is another plausible diagnosis.

3. **Sebaceous Carcinoma**
   - This rare but aggressive periocular malignancy can present similarly with a firm, non-tender mass, often leading to extensive local invasion.

4. **Orbital Lymphoma**
   - Rapid growth and mass that displaces ocular structures without lymphadenopathy could suggest a primary orbital lymphoma.

5. **Meningioma**
   - A slow-growing brain tumor that can erode bone and invade orbit, presenting with a firm mass and ophthalmic symptoms.

6. **Metastatic Carcinoma**
   - Given the patient’s age and comorbid conditions, a metastatic lesion from another primary site (e.g., lung or breast) could end up in the external orbit.

7. **Sinonasal Carcinoma**
   - Tumors originating from the paranasal sinuses can involve the frontal sinus and orbit with bony erosion.

8. **Chronic Invasive Fungal Sinusitis**
   - Immunocompromised or older patients may exhibit chronic invasive fungal infections causing bony destruction and a firm mass.

9. **Osteosarcoma**
   - Given the destructive bone changes noted on the CT scan, a primary malignant bone tumor of the orbit (though rare in this age group) is possible.

10. **Mucocele**
    - Chronic mucoceles could cause expansion, bony erosion, and initially firm mass relatively more benign compared to other diagnoses.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis List:

1. **Sebaceous Carcinoma**
   - The histopathological findings of large nests of neoplastic epithelioid cells with clear, vacuolated cytoplasm and fibrotic tissue points toward an aggressive malignancy like sebaceous carcinoma.
   
2. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**
   - Given the patient's age, neglected mass, and gradual presentation align with BCC, though less invasive typically than what imaging and histopathology suggest.

3. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**
   - Considering the patient's history of tobacco abuse and the destructive nature seen, SCC remains highly likely.
   
4. **Metastatic Carcinoma**
   - The patient's extensive comorbidities raise the possibility of metastasis, warranting further systemic evaluation for secondary primary sites.
   
5. **Sinonasal Carcinoma**
   - The aggressive nature and involvement of the frontal sinus make sinonasal carcinoma a significant consideration.
   
6. **Orbital Lymphoma**
   - Though less likely without lymphadenopathy, the displacement of the globe and its mass effect can suggest a primary orbital lymphoma.
   
7. **Meningioma**
   - With bony erosion and the patient's age, meningioma remains possible yet less likely to present with such severe local invasion.
   
8. **Chronic Invasive Fungal Sinusitis**
   - Possible but less likely without immunocompromised state or soft tissue inflammatory signs.
   
9. **Osteosarcoma**
   - A rarer entity for this age but still within differential due to bony destruction noted.
   
10. **Mucocele**
    - Though potential for chronic presentation, less consistent with severe invasive and neoplastic histopathology observed.","['Oncology', 'Skin Cancer', 'External Eye Disease', 'Ophthalmology', 'Otolaryngology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,70.0,M

### INPUT:
A woman in her 30s was referred for evaluation of bilateral papilledema and progressive visual loss in the right eye, which deteriorated to blindness in 3 months. She denied any other neurologic symptoms, such as headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, and paresis. She had a 4-year history of Behçet disease (BD), and her condition had been stabilized with thalidomide. Her optic neuropathy of BD had been treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for 4 days followed by oral prednisone for a month without improvement. Her best-corrected visual acuity was no light perception OD and 20/20 OS. Intraocular pressure was 21 mm Hg OD and 19 mm Hg OS. Fundus examination revealed papilledema in both eyes (Figure 1A). No obvious sign of optic disc ischemia or active uveitis was observed by fundus fluorescein angiography bilaterally. Humphrey visual fields showed complete visual field loss in the right eye and peripheral visual field defects in the left eye. Her anterior segment was normal in both eyes except for relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. Cranial nerve examination was otherwise unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed no remarkable abnormalities except for partially empty sella (Figure 1B). She had normal blood pressure levels. Results of laboratory testing regarding systemic infection were negative, and her serum D-dimer level was normal.

    ",Cerebral venous thrombosis,"### Initial 10-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)**
2. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)**
3. **Optic Neuritis**
4. **Giant Cell Arteritis**
5. **Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AION)**
6. **Neurosarcoidosis**
7. **Lupus Optic Neuropathy**
8. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**
9. **Intracranial Neoplasm**
10. **Cryptococcal Meningitis**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis with Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)**
   - Reasoning: Bilateral papilledema and partially empty sella on MRI without other significant abnormalities are highly suggestive of IIH.
   
2. **Optic Neuritis**
   - Reasoning: The visual field defects and relative afferent pupillary defect could be consistent with optic neuritis.

3. **Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AION)**
   - Reasoning: Although fundoscopy did not show classic signs of ischemia, the abrupt visual loss could fit AION patterns.

4. **Neurosarcoidosis**
   - Reasoning: Sarcoidosis can cause optic neuropathy and is a consideration with ongoing inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases.

5. **Lupus Optic Neuropathy**
   - Reasoning: Despite absence of histological lupus, co-occurring autoimmune diseases make it a potential differential.

6. **Giant Cell Arteritis**
   - Reasoning: Typically affects older patients but can occasionally present in younger individuals with rapid visual loss.

7. **Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)**
   - Reasoning: Sudden, severe visual loss is indicative, though fundus examination was not characteristic.

8. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**
   - Reasoning: MS can present with optic neuropathies, although MRI findings and lack of other neurological symptoms make it less likely.

9. **Intracranial Neoplasm**
   - Reasoning: Visual loss due to mass effect, albeit MRI showed no significant abnormalities.

10. **Cryptococcal Meningitis**
    - Reasoning: Can cause papilledema due to increased intracranial pressure; low probability given negative infectious workup.

### Summary

Given the clinical presentation, MRI findings, and absence of systemic or infectious signs, **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)** stands out as the most likely diagnosis. Other differentials should be considered if additional supportive symptoms or test results emerge.","['Neuro-ophthalmology', 'Neurology', 'Ophthalmology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30.0,F

### INPUT:
A man in his 30s presented with painless swelling of the left upper limb and nodules on the left side of the chest and abdomen. The lesions had started a month previously as red nodules on the left axilla, ipsilateral chest, and back. Twenty days later, he developed edema in the left upper limb. While being evaluated for the cutaneous lesions, the patient was diagnosed with AIDS and began antiretroviral therapy. On examination, 6 erythematous, firm, subcutaneous nodules were present on the left side of the chest, abdomen, and left upper limb, varying in size from 2 × 2 cm to 4 × 4 cm (Figure, A). There was diffuse erythema and edema on the left upper limb, leading to difficulty in limb movement (Figure, A). Multiple dilated superficial vessels were present on the posterior aspect of the left arm and ipsilateral chest wall. Left axillary lymph nodes were grossly enlarged, firm, nontender, and nonmatted, with the largest lymph node measuring 6 × 4 cm. The patient’s CD4 cell count was 141/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), and his HIV load was 504 473 copies/mL. A skin biopsy sample was obtained from the plaque and sent for histopathologic examination (Figure, B and C). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Burkitt lymphoma,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Kaposi Sarcoma**: Given the patient's immunocompromised status (AIDS), CD4 count, and presentation of erythematous nodules and edema.

2. **Cutaneous Bacillary Angiomatosis**: Common in AIDS patients, presents with skin lesions similar to the described nodules.

3. **Lymphoma (especially primary effusion lymphoma)**: AIDS patients are at increased risk, presenting with atypical nodular skin lesions and lymphadenopathy.

4. **Tuberculosis (TB) Lymphadenitis**: Swollen, nontender lymph nodes in immunocompromised patients may suggest TB lymphadenitis.

5. **Fungal Infections (e.g., Cryptococcosis, Histoplasmosis)**: Can present with subcutaneous nodules and affect immunocompromised individuals.

6. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**: Although less common, it can cause painful nodules and ulcers, and is sometimes seen in immunocompromised patients.

7. **Sarcoidosis**: Rare in AIDS patients, but can present with cutaneous nodules and enlarged lymph nodes.

8. **Syphilis**: Secondary syphilis can present with nodular skin lesions; however, painless lesions make this less likely.

9. **Mycobacterial Infections (Non-TB)**: Present with skin nodules and lymphadenopathy in immunocompromised patients.

10. **Metastatic Cancer**: Although rare, metastatic lesions might present as nodular skin lesions in immunocompromised states.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis (considering all patient information and test results):

1. **Kaposi Sarcoma**: This is the most likely diagnosis given the patient’s AIDS status, the presentation with erythematous nodules, and the typical association of the disease with immunocompromised states.

2. **Cutaneous Bacillary Angiomatosis**: Strong contender due to similar presentation and prevalence in patients with low CD4 count in AIDS.

3. **Lymphoma (Primary effusion lymphoma)**: Highly suspect due to the nodules and lymphadenopathy in an AIDS patient, though the specific appearance on histopathology would help differentiate.

4. **Fungal Infections (e.g., Cryptococcosis, Histoplasmosis)**: Common in AIDS, could also explain nodules and systemic involvement.

5. **Mycobacterial Infections (Non-TB)**: Given the immune status and presentation with lesions and significant lymphadenopathy.

6. **Tuberculosis (TB) Lymphadenitis**: Though possible, the lack of systemic TB symptoms and the specific characteristics of the skin lesions favor other diagnoses more strongly.

7. **Metastatic Cancer**: Metastatic cancer becomes less likely without history or other primary site symptoms but is still considered in the differential.

8. **Syphilis**: Less likely given the specific presentation of the nodules, but still possible due to the patient's immunosuppressed status.

9. **Sarcoidosis**: Uncommon in AIDS patients and the presentation doesn’t quite fit typical sarcoidosis, making it less likely.

10. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**: Least likely due to the description of the skin lesions being painless and not characteristic of the disease.

### INPUT:
A 44-year-old man with a 2-week history of fevers, night sweats, chills, and petechiae presented with painless, blurry vision in the left eye. His ocular symptoms began 2 days prior when he noticed dark scotomas in his central field and decreased visual acuity. There was no recent trauma or strenuous physical activity. He had no relevant medical, ocular, or family history, and he denied use of illicit drugs or anticoagulants. Uncorrected visual acuity was 20/30 OD and 20/400 OS. Extraocular motility and intraocular pressures were normal. Results of an anterior examination was unremarkable. Dilated funduscopic examination of the left eye revealed a pink optic nerve with sharp margins, diffuse intraretinal hemorrhages and Roth spots extending from the posterior pole to the far periphery, and preretinal hemorrhage overlying the central macula (Figure, A). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography through the preretinal macular hemorrhage demonstrated layered blood in the sub–internal limiting membrane space (Figure, B). The right fundus exhibited a similar appearance aside from the preretinal hemorrhage. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Acute myeloid leukemia,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps

1. **Infective Endocarditis**: Given the patient's systemic symptoms (fevers, night sweats, chills, and petechiae) and ocular findings (Roth spots), infective endocarditis should be high on the differential.

2. **Leukemia**: The presence of petechiae and systemic symptoms raises the possibility of a hematologic malignancy such as leukemia.

3. **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)**: This condition could also explain the systemic symptoms and the retinal hemorrhages observed.

4. **Severe Hypertensive Retinopathy**: Although the patient does not have a known history of hypertension, severe hypertensive retinopathy could present with retinal hemorrhages and visual disturbances.

5. **Diabetic Retinopathy**: Even without a known history of diabetes, undiagnosed or new-onset diabetes could be a potential cause of retinal findings.

6. **Viral Retinitis**: Despite the lack of a history or systemic symptoms specific to viral infections, certain viruses can cause retinitis with hemorrhagic presentations.

7. **Sarcoidosis**: Sarcoidosis can involve the eye and present with systemic symptoms; ocular involvement can lead to retinal hemorrhages.

8. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: SLE can cause ocular manifestations such as hemorrhages and should be considered, particularly with systemic symptoms.

9. **Multiple Myeloma**: This condition can also present with systemic symptoms and ocular manifestations, including retinal hemorrhages due to hyperviscosity.

10. **Hypercoagulable States**: Various hypercoagulable conditions can lead to systemic and ocular manifestations similar to those observed in this patient.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis After Further Evaluation

1. **Infective Endocarditis**: Continues to be the top of the list given the systemic and ocular symptoms, particularly the Roth spots which are classic for this diagnosis.

2. **Leukemia**: The combination of systemic symptoms, petechiae, and ocular findings makes this the second most likely diagnosis.

3. **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)**: The presence of petechiae and hemorrhages maintains DIC as a significant differential, although less likely without a precipitating event.

4. **Severe Hypertensive Retinopathy**: Although it ranks lower without a history of hypertension, it remains relevant given the hemorrhagic retinal findings.

5. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: Given its ability to present with systemic and ocular symptoms, SLE is still a contender.

6. **Multiple Myeloma**: While it is less likely than the above diagnoses, it can still cause visual disturbances and systemic symptoms.

7. **Hypercoagulable States**: Given the findings and lack of significant additional history pointing towards this condition, it remains a differential but lower on the list.

8. **Sarcoidosis**: While it can present with systemic and ocular symptoms, the lack of other specific signs makes it less likely.

9. **Diabetic Retinopathy**: Based on the lack of known history and the presenting symptoms, it ranks lower.

10. **Viral Retinitis**: This diagnosis becomes less likely given the systemic nature of the symptoms and lack of specific signs of viral infection.

Further diagnostic tests such as blood cultures, echocardiogram, complete blood count, coagulation profile, ANA test, serum protein electrophoresis, and assessments for viral markers would help confirm or rule out these differentials.","['Retinal Disorders', 'Ophthalmology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Leukemias', 'Hematology']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,44.0,M

### INPUT:
A 31-year-old gravida 1, para 1 woman with a history of Wolff-Parkinson-White disease and recently diagnosed stage II Hodgkin lymphoma presented with a pruritic rash. She was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma at 35 weeks’ gestation, and 1 week later she underwent cesarean delivery. At 3 weeks’ postpartum, she began chemotherapy (cycle 1, day 1) with adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD). On day 15 of cycle 1, she presented with linear, hyperpigmented streaks and welts on her arms, back, and legs. Intense, diffuse pruritus had developed within 24 hours of the patient’s first day of treatment, and her symptoms were poorly responsive to antihistamines and topical steroids. Pruritus was followed by the appearance of dark scratch marks as demonstrated in the Figure. Laboratory test results revealed a white blood cell count of 1.6 ×103 cells/mm3, with an absolute neutrophil count of 500 cells/mm3 and a total bilirubin of 0.3 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 17.104), which was unchanged from the baseline total bilirubin. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Bleomycin toxic effects,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps

1. **Allergic Contact Dermatitis**
   - Given the new chemotherapy regimen, an allergic reaction to one of the drugs could explain the rash and pruritis.

2. **Drug-Induced Rash**
   - Chemotherapy can cause various types of dermatological reactions, including rashes.

3. **Paraneoplastic Itch**
   - Hodgkin lymphoma itself can cause pruritus, unrelated to chemotherapy.

4. **Infectious Dermatitis**
   - Considering immunocompromisation (WBC count), an infectious cause might be contributing.

5. **Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD)**
   - Although not post-transplant, chemotherapy can rarely mimic GVHD in terms of skin manifestations.

6. **Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis)**
   - Given the intensity and unresponsive nature to antihistamines and steroids, a severe form of eczema could be suspected.

7. **Petechiae/Purpura from Chemotherapy**
   - Chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia can present as petechial rashes or purpura, though usually non-pruritic.

8. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)**
   - A severe drug reaction is possible, although this typically presents with mucosal involvement.

9. **Bullous Pemphigoid**
   - An autoimmune blistering disorder that could be triggered by drugs and presents with intense pruritus.

10. **Erythema Multiforme**
    - It can appear after infections or drug exposures, with both itchy and non-itchy presentations.

### Reranked Diagnosis with All Patient Information

1. **Drug-Induced Rash**
   - Most consistent with the timing of chemotherapy and the subsequent acute onset of symptoms.
   
2. **Paraneoplastic Itch**
   - Fits with the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma and its known complications.

3. **Infectious Dermatitis**
   - Due to immunocompromised state (low WBC count), higher risk of infection.

4. **Allergic Contact Dermatitis**
   - Possible, but less likely considering the intense response and involvement of multiple areas.

5. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)**
   - Needs to be ruled out due to severity, even if lower probability without mucosal involvement.

6. **Bullous Pemphigoid**
   - Uncommon but possible, needs to be considered given pruritic nature.

7. **Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD)-like Reaction**
   - Very rare, but chemotherapy can mimic this presentation.

8. **Erythema Multiforme**
   - Possible but less likely compared to others; no clear precipitating factor.

9. **Petechiae/Purpura from Chemotherapy**
   - Lacks the petechial nature of the rash described; not fitting well.

10. **Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis)**
    - Unresponsive to steroids and antihistamines makes this less likely.","['Dermatology', 'Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Lymphomas']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,31.0,F

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**: Given the history of radiation therapy and similar reported lesions in family members, BCC is highly plausible.
2. **Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)**: The family history of similar cutaneous lesions in close relatives suggests a hereditary condition such as NF1.
3. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**: The history of radiation increases risk for SCC, and ulceration is a common feature.
4. **Cutaneous Metastases**: Considering his history of multiple primary tumors (medulloblastoma and meningioma), metastatic lesions must be considered.
5. **Mycosis Fungoides (MF)**: The distribution and description of lesions could align with MF, albeit it’s less common.
6. **Meningioma**: Due to the previous history, recurrence or spread of meningioma should be factored in, although it’s less typically cutaneous.
7. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans (DFSP)**: Rare, but can present with similar nodular or plaque-like lesions.
8. **Kaposi Sarcoma**: Unlikely given no mention of immunosuppression, but still a consideration.
9. **Lichen Planus**: Less likely given the specific nature of plaque and papule description and ulceration.
10. **Seborrheic Keratosis**: Unlikely given the patient’s age and the specific ulceration and distribution of lesions. 

### Conclusion
Given the information and medical history, Basal Cell Carcinoma stands out as the most likely diagnosis, closely followed by considerations of a hereditary syndrome such as Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and the risks posed by previous radiation exposure potentially leading to Squamous Cell Carcinoma or Cutaneous Metastases.","['Dermatology', 'Neuro-oncology', 'Neurology', 'Oncology', 'Radiation Oncology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,20.0,M

His medical history was significant for Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia refractory to multiple treatments, including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, with transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) status posttreatment. At the time of evaluation, he had been hospitalized for 5 months with severe protein-calorie malnutrition, pancytopenia, and recurrent neutropenic fevers. The patient was febrile (38.3°C), with a white blood cell count of 0.5/μL (absolute neutrophil count 0.00; to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), hemoglobin levels of 7.6g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), hematocrit 21%, and platelet count 9/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 1.0). He was not receiving active cancer treatment. He appeared cachectic and pale. Intraoral examination revealed poor oral hygiene. The left hard palate exhibited a large swelling with a 5×3-cm indurated area of ulceration, central necrosis, and desquamation (Figure, A). The patient was treated palliatively with dexamethasone solution and nystatin rinse. A biopsy was not recommended owing to medical instability. However, the patient retained a sloughed fragment of the affected tissue, which was submitted for histologic evaluation. A maxillofacial computed tomography (CT) scan completed the etiological investigation.

5. Oral squamous cell carcinoma
6. Candidiasis
7. Cryptococcal infection
8. Tuberculosis (orofacial)
9. HSV-induced oral ulcers
10. Syphilitic gumma

### Reasoning:
1. **Mucormycosis**: Given the patient's severely immunocompromised state, neutropenia, and the rapid progression of oral lesions with significant necrosis and desquamation, this is highly suggestive of an aggressive fungal infection like mucormycosis.
2. **Invasive aspergillosis**: Similar predisposing factors as mucormycosis. Immunocompromised patients, especially with hematologic malignancies, are at high risk.
3. **Noma (cancrum oris)**: Severe malnutrition and immunosuppression can lead to this gangrenous condition affecting the oral and facial tissues.
4. **Leukemic infiltration**: Considering his history of refractory B-cell ALL and transformation to AML, leukemic infiltration could be a plausible cause of the oral lesions.
5. **Oral squamous cell carcinoma**: Although less likely due to the rapid onset and severe necrosis, it is still a potential differential to consider.
6. **Candidiasis**: Given the poor oral hygiene and immunocompromised state, candidiasis is a possible, though less likely, cause of such extensive ulceration and necrosis.
7. **Cryptococcal infection**: Immunocompromised individuals are at risk, though it usually presents as meningitis or pulmonary disease.
8. **Tuberculosis (orofacial)**: Mycobacterial infections can present with chronic ulceration, but the acute and aggressive nature makes this less likely.
9. **HSV-induced oral ulcers**: Immunocompromised patients can have severe forms of herpetic lesions, but the extensive necrosis and ulceration make this a less likely primary cause.
10. **Syphilitic gumma**: Presents with nodular lesions and ulceration, but the patient's history and clinical presentation make this low on the differential list.","['Dermatology', 'Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Leukemias', 'Clinical Challenge', 'Dental Medicine', 'Pain Medicine']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,20.0,M

### INPUT:
A 33-year-old white man presented with a 5-month history of a progressively necrotic plaque on the nose and scattered nodules on the extremities. The plaque first appeared as a small inflammatory papule on the left nostril. Shortly thereafter, the patient was hospitalized at an outside facility for multifocal pneumonia. He was also treated for a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection of his nose. Despite antibiotic therapy, the papule continued to grow and ulcerate and eventually became necrotic (Figure, A). One month before presentation at our facility, the patient began developing erythematous papules on his arms and legs. The papules enlarged and ulcerated. Some of them healed spontaneously with poxlike scars. He had no recent history of travel. At admission, the patient was tachycardic and febrile to a temperature of 38.5°C. Routine laboratory testing revealed normocytic anemia (hemoglobin, 7.7 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]). Shave biopsies of necrotic nodules on the left arm and left cheek (Figure, B-D) and, later, an excisional biopsy of a cervical lymph node were performed. Head computed tomography demonstrated a soft-tissue mass that encased the nasal bone and extended into the right maxillary sinus and left nasal cavity. Chest computed tomography showed bilateral pulmonary nodules. Physical examination revealed a necrotic plaque with surrounding erythema on the distal nose (Figure, A). A 1 × 1-cm crateriform papule with central necrosis was present on the left malar cheek. Multiple nodules with central, dry necrosis and areas of poxlike scarring were scattered across the extremities. Slight contractures of his fingers were also noted. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Lymphomatoid granulomatosis,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Skin Cancer**
   - The progressively necrotic plaque, especially on the nose, and its spread to nodules on the extremities raises suspicion for a malignancy like squamous cell carcinoma.
   
2. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)**
   - This disease can present with necrotic ulcers, upper respiratory involvement, and systemic symptoms like multifocal pneumonia.

3. **Leishmaniasis**
   - Considering the presence of necrotic skin lesions, leishmaniasis should be considered, although he has no travel history, the possibility of non-travel related/transmission situation could be possible.

4. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**
   - This condition presents with painful, necrotic skin ulcers, mimicking the progressive nature of the patient's lesions.

5. **Cutaneous Tuberculosis**
   - Tuberculosis can manifest with necrotic skin lesions and systemic symptoms including multiple nodules seen on imaging.

6. **Lymphoma**
   - Systemic symptoms, necrotic skin lesions, and involvement of multiple organ systems, including lymphatic involvement, can be indicative of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

7. **Disseminated Fungal Infection**
   - Opportunistic infections like disseminated histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis can present with skin lesions and pulmonary nodules.

8. **Relapsing Polychondritis**
   - Though rare, it can cause severe inflammation and necrotic changes of cartilaginous structures, including the nose.

9. **Syphilis (Tertiary)**
   - Although less common, tertiary syphilis can result in severe necrotic lesions and systemic involvement.

10. **Sarcoidosis**
    - This disease can present with skin lesions, lung involvement, and systemic manifestations.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)**
   - Given the combination of necrotic lesions, upper respiratory involvement, bilateral pulmonary nodules, and systemic symptoms, GPA remains highly likely.

2. **Lymphoma**
   - Persistent and extensive necrotic skin lesions, systemic involvement, and lymph node biopsy results necessitate considering cutaneous lymphoma.

3. **Disseminated Fungal Infection**
   - Resilient necrotic skin lesions and multifocal pneumonia suggest a possible underlying disseminated fungal infection.

4. **Leishmaniasis**
   - Given the extensive cutaneous and systemic findings, despite no travel history, leishmaniasis could still be a differential due to potential non-endemic transmission.

5. **Cutaneous Tuberculosis**
   - Similar to disseminated fungal infections, tuberculosis could explain the combination of extensive skin and pulmonary findings.

6. **Skin Cancer**
   - The necrotic lesion starting as a small papule on the nose before spreading could suggest a malignant process.

7. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**
   - Although primarily considered, the systemic involvement steers towards other differential diagnoses; however, its presence still makes it a significant consideration.

8. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Given bilateral pulmonary nodules and skin involvement, sarcoidosis remains a consideration, albeit less central compared to other causes.

9. **Syphilis (Tertiary)**
   - The chronic nature and characteristics of the skin lesions suggest consideration, but the patient's history and other systemic findings point in different directions more strongly.

10. **Relapsing Polychondritis**
    - The necrotic involvement of cartilaginous structures like the nose is suggestive but less likely given the broader range of symptoms seen.

### Summary:
1. Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)
2. Lymphoma
3. Disseminated Fungal Infection
4. Leishmaniasis
5. Cutaneous Tuberculosis
6. Skin Cancer
7. Pyoderma Gangrenosum
8. Sarcoidosis

### INPUT:
A man in his mid-50s presented with painless blurry vision in the left eye. According to the patient’s report, he had experienced this vision abnormality in the left eye for 1 week. At presentation, visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/400 OS. Results of a dilated fundus examination were normal in the right eye and notable for a macular serous retinal detachment in the left eye (Figure 1A). Findings on optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a dome-shaped collection of subretinal fluid in the macula (not shown). Late-phase fluorescein angiography revealed multifocal pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence with mild leakage within the area of detachment (Figure 1B). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Acute myeloid leukemia,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC)**: Given the serous retinal detachment and subretinal fluid on OCT, CSC is a common cause of this presentation, particularly in middle-aged men.

2. **Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV)**: The presence of multifocal areas of hyperfluorescence on fluorescein angiography could be indicative of CNV, which can cause subretinal fluid and leakage.

3. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**: Although typically associated with older age, intermediate AMD can present similarly and should be considered.

4. **Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV)**: A variant of AMD, PCV is characterized by polyp-like lesions and can present with subretinal fluid and pigment epithelial detachment.

5. **Idiopathic Juxtafoveal Telangiectasia (MacTel)**: This diagnosis involves dilated capillaries in the macula and can cause subtle leakage seen on fluorescein angiography.

6. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome**: This rare condition involves fluid accumulation under the retina due to abnormalities in the sclera.

7. **Inflammatory Diseases (e.g., Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease)**: Systemic inflammatory conditions can cause serous retinal detachments, often with multifocal leakage sites.

8. **Pathologic Myopia**: Highly myopic patients can develop macular abnormalities, including serous retinal detachments and secondary CNV.

9. **Hypertensive Retinopathy**: Severe or long-standing hypertension can cause retinal changes, leading to subretinal fluid.

10. **Diabetic Retinopathy**: While typically associated with retinal hemorrhages and exudates, diabetic retinopathy can sometimes present with macular edema and serous detachment.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Considering All Information:

1. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC)**: The demographic (mid-50s male), a painless, unilateral vision loss with serous retinal detachment, and OCT/angiography findings strongly suggest CSC.
   
2. **Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV)**: The leakage noted on the fluorescein angiography indicates CNV as a potential differential.

3. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**: Given the patient’s age and the finding of subretinal fluid, intermediate AMD remains a consideration.

4. **Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV)**: The clinical presentation could fit PCV, which presents with lesions causing subretinal fluid.

5. **Idiopathic Juxtafoveal Telangiectasia (MacTel)**: Subtle clues on fluorescein angiography could correspond to MacTel, even if less likely.

6. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome**: Although rare, it remains a possibility considering the subretinal fluid.

7. **Inflammatory Diseases (e.g., Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease)**: Multifocal areas of hyperfluorescence might point towards an inflammatory cause if other symptoms or systemic investigations corroborate.

8. **Pathologic Myopia**: Subretinal fluid and possible secondary myopic CNV could explain the findings, if history of high myopia is considered.

9. **Hypertensive Retinopathy**: Less likely, but severe hypertension could theoretically present similarly.

10. **Diabetic Retinopathy**: Unlikely given the lack of other typical diabetic retinopathy signs but is still considered in the differential list.

### Summary:
Given the information, Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC) stands out as the most likely diagnosis, followed by conditions such as CNV and AMD based on similar presentations involving subretinal fluid and pinpoint hyperfluorescence. Each diagnosis must be revisited with potential supplementary history or investigative results for final confirmation.","['Ophthalmology', 'Macular Diseases', 'Retinal Disorders', 'Hematology', 'Oncology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,55.0,M

### INPUT:
A 67-year-old man presented with a rapidly enlarging scalp lesion (Figure 1A) first noticed 3 months earlier as a pimple. The lesion was itchy but without generalized pruritus. The patient reported a weight loss of 10 pounds over the preceding 3 months. In addition, he reported a longer history of vague, nonspecific, intermittent abdominal pain without nausea, vomiting, or fever starting about 3 years prior to presentation. Previous work-up had revealed minimal abdominal adenopathy, but the patient declined further workup. On examination, he had no other cutaneous lesions, but he did have cervical lymphadenopathy. All other physical findings were within normal limits. Laboratory findings were unremarkable, save for a mild normochromic normocytic anemia and a mildly elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase.

8. **Cutaneous Metastasis from Internal Malignancy**
9. **Lymphoma (e.g., Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma)**
10. **Kaposi Sarcoma**

### Final Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Cutaneous Metastasis from Internal Malignancy**:
   - Rapid enlargement of lesion.
   - History of abdominal pain and weight loss suggests internal malignancy.
   - Cervical lymphadenopathy and mild normochromic normocytic anemia.
  
2. **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma**:
   - Itchy lesion.
   - Cervical lymphadenopathy.
   - Mildly elevated lactate dehydrogenase.

3. **Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma**:
   - History of vague abdominal pain.
   - Cervical lymphadenopathy.
   - Elevated lactate dehydrogenase.

4. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma**:
   - Rapidly enlarging lesion.
   - Typical presentation in elderly patients.
   - Cervical lymphadenopathy potential.

5. **Malignant Melanoma**:
   - Rapidly growing lesion on sun-exposed area.
   - Weight loss.

6. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**:
   - Rapidly enlarging lesion.

7. **Kaposi Sarcoma**:
   - Rapidly enlarging lesion; however, less likely due to lack of history suggestive of immunosuppression or HIV.

8. **Basal Cell Carcinoma**:
   - Though typically less aggressive, it should still be considered for the rapidly growing lesion.

9. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans**:
   - Rapid growth, although classically less common with lymphadenopathy.

10. **Seborrheic Keratosis**:
    - Benign, but typically not rapidly enlarging.

### INPUT:
A 55-year-old man with no significant medical history presented with several weeks of malaise and a 6.8-kg weight loss associated with poor appetite. He reported no fevers, night sweats, abdominal pain, emesis, and diarrhea. Physical examination revealed a thin habitus; no palmar erythema, spider angiomas, or gynecomastia were observed. Laboratory tests showed normal complete blood cell count and chemistry panel findings. Hepatic panel showed an elevated alkaline phosphatase level (209 U/L; upper limit of normal [ULN], 150 U/L [3.49 μkat/L; ULN, 2.5 μkat/L]), normal total bilirubin level (0.4 mg/dL [6.84 μmol/L]), elevated alanine aminotransferase level (41 U/L; ULN, 35 U/L [0.68 μkat/L; ULN, 0.58 μkat/L]), and normal aspartate aminotransferase level (27 U/L [0.45 μkat/L]). A single-phase computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed multiple hypoattenuating masses with rim enhancement throughout the liver, intussusception of the small bowel, and normal liver contour with no signs of portal hypertension (Figure 1, left). α-Fetoprotein (AFP) level was elevated (1252 ng/mL; ULN, 9 ng/mL); levels of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (<2 U/mL) and carcinoembryonic antigen (2.8 ng/mL) were normal. A triple-phase CT scan was obtained to further evaluate the small bowel, which revealed no small bowel abnormalities but instead demonstrated a 3.3 × 2.8-cm heterogeneously enhancing pancreatic tail mass not seen on the previous single-phase CT (Figure 1, right). 
### OUTPUT:

1. **Step 1: Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)**
   - Reasoning: Elevated AFP, multiple hypoattenuating liver masses, and elevated liver enzymes.

2. **Step 2: Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma**
   - Reasoning: Elevated AFP, pancreatic tail mass, and multiple liver masses.

3. **Step 3: Cholangiocarcinoma**

### INPUT:
A woman in her 70s with a history of pulmonary embolism presented to the emergency department with acute right eye vision loss. She described a 2-week medical history of diplopia and blurry vision as well as 4 months of nasal congestion and progressive headaches despite multiple antibiotic courses. She denied a medical history of sinonasal issues, immunodeficiency, autoimmune disease, malignant disease, or diabetes. On examination, she was afebrile with stable vital signs. Ophthalmologic evaluation revealed a right afferent pupillary defect and cranial sixth-nerve palsy. Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging of the sinuses revealed abnormal soft tissue throughout her sinuses with destruction of the sinus walls and skull base as well as extension of abnormal appearing tissue into the right orbital apex and posterior nasal septum. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated a normal white blood cell count and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level. Nasal endoscopy showed bloody mucus and crusting around the right middle turbinate and sphenoethmoidal recess. The acute nature of her vision loss amid concern for a destructive sinonasal process warranted operative intervention. Abnormal soft tissue with associated destruction throughout her sinonasal cavities and right orbital apex was identified. Frozen sections revealed negative results for fungal elements and cellular dysplasia but demonstrated widespread inflammation with giant cells. A representative final pathology slide is shown in the Figure.

### Reranking All Differential Diagnoses

Based on the patient's presentation, imaging findings, lab results, and pathology, we can now rerank the differential diagnoses:

1. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)**: The constellation of sinonasal involvement, orbital apex involvement, bloody mucus, and giant cells on pathology is highly suggestive of GPA. 
2. **Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA)**: Considering the patient's age and the presence of giant cells, GCA is a strong contender, though typically more systemic symptoms might be expected.
3. **IgG4-Related Disease**: This could explain the inflammatory process and orbital involvement; however, the pathology findings are more striking for GPA.
4. **Sarcoidosis**: The presence of giant cells can be seen in sarcoidosis, but the lack of systemic symptoms and sinonasal destruction makes it less probable.
5. **Mucormycosis**: Initial concern might have been for a fungal infection, but frozen sections ruled out fungal elements.
6. **Sinonasal Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Though the destructive pattern could be seen in malignancies, the pathology was negative for cellular dysplasia.
7. **Chronic Sinusitis with Orbital Complications**: This could explain some symptoms but lacks the aggressive tissue destruction and blood findings.
8. **Takayasu Arteritis**: This vasculitis could explain some symptoms but generally affects large vessels and has different clinical manifestations.
9. **Relapsing Polychondritis**: While it may present with inflammatory symptoms, it lacks direct correlation with severe sinonasal destruction.
10. **Pituitary Adenoma**: Might present with diplopia and vision loss, but does not explain the extensive sinus and nasal findings. 

Thus, the most plausible diagnosis in this scenario is Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis, closely followed by Giant Cell Arteritis and IgG4-Related Disease.","['Ophthalmology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Clinical Challenge', 'Infectious Diseases']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,70.0,F

### INPUT:
A 32-year-old Hispanic man without significant medical history presented with nasal pain and swelling, progressive for 6 weeks. He had been hospitalized for this problem at an outside hospital and treated with antibiotics, without improvement. The swelling worsened and extended to his upper lip. He developed difficulty swallowing, headache, and nasal drainage. On presentation, he was afebrile without leukocytosis. Physical examination demonstrated diffuse swelling and tenderness of the nose with honey-colored crusting that extended to above his upper lip. Axial and sagittal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) (Figure, A and B) demonstrated marked soft tissue swelling and fullness with abnormal enhancement along the nasal cavity, including bilateral nasal ala, with areas of necrosis and emphysema. No significant bony erosion or associated calcification on bone windows was noted. After bedside debridement of the nasal soft tissue region, axial postcontrast T1-weighted fat-suppressed and sagittal T2-weighted fat-suppressed magnetic resonance imaging through the nasal cavity (Figure, C and D) demonstrated soft tissue fullness isointense to muscle on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and with homogenous enhancement of the solid component on postcontrast T1-weighted images. No intracranial or intraorbital disease extension was noted. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Extranodal T-cell lymphoma,"Thank you for the detailed patient presentation. Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, let's move through a 10-step differential diagnosis process step-by-step:

### Step-by-step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Mucormycosis** - Fungal infection, possibly exacerbated by underlying conditions such as diabetes or immunosuppression.
2. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)** - An autoimmune condition characterized by necrotizing granulomas and vasculitis.
3. **Sinonasal Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - A malignant tumor common in the nasal cavity that could lead to tissue necrosis and infection.
4. **Invasive Fungal Sinusitis** - Apart from mucormycosis, could be an invasive species like Aspergillus especially in immunocompromised patients.
5. **Bacterial Cellulitis** - Severe cases of bacterial infection leading to necrotizing fasciitis.
6. **Lupus Profundus** - A variant of lupus erythematosus which manifests as subcutaneous nodules mostly in individuals with systemic lupus.
7. **Tuberculosis** - Nasal manifestations of TB, especially in endemic regions or immunocompromised state.
8. **Rhinoentomophthoromycosis** - A rare type of fungal infection seen in tropical areas.
9. **Sinonasal Lymphoma** - Can present as a mass with significant necrosis and swelling.
10. **Behcet's Disease** - A systemic vasculitis that can present with oral and genital ulcers and can involve the nasal tissue.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Mucormycosis**: Given the severe degree of necrosis and high index of suspicion with such clinical presentation, particularly in an afebrile patient without leukocytosis.
2. **Invasive Fungal Sinusitis**: Another strong consideration due to progressive nasal soft tissue involvement.
3. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**: Compatible with necrotizing granulomatous inflammation seen in imaging.
4. **Sinonasal Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Although rare, it remains a differential we can't overlook.
5. **Bacterial Cellulitis**: With necrotizing processes and secondary infection components.
6. **Tuberculosis**: Always a differential in persistent infections in endemic regions or immunodeficient states.
7. **Lupus Profundus**: Uncommon but could explain some inflammatory and necrotizing patterns.
8. **Sinonasal Lymphoma**: Requires biopsy for definitive diagnosis, given mass effect without intraorbital extension.
9. **Rhinoentomophthoromycosis**: Based on geographical context; less likely but to consider in particular regions.
10. **Behcet's Disease**: Rare but still a possibility, especially if other systemic symptoms align.

### INPUT:
A girl presented with a left posterior triangle neck mass that had progressed for 3 years following a motor vehicle accident. On physical examination, the mass was firm, mobile, tender to palpation, and caused restricted range of motion. Ultrasound imaging of the soft tissue of the neck was obtained, which demonstrated a neck mass with dense acoustic shadowing (Figure 1A). Further evaluation with contrasted computed tomography (CT) imaging showed a 3.3×2.9×2.6-cm ossified lesion in the left posterior-lateral cervical soft tissue near the atlanto-axial junction. The lesion was well circumscribed and separate from the underlying bone (Figure 1B). The patient underwent excision of the mass without complication. The gross pathology specimen showed a firm, irregular, encapsulated mass. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Myositis ossificans,"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:
1. **Osteoma** - A benign, slow-growing mass of bone often found in the craniofacial region, particularly following trauma.
2. **Myositis Ossificans** - A benign, ossifying soft tissue mass often developing after trauma or repeated injury.
3. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - A malignant soft tissue tumor that can occur in the neck and is more common in children and adolescents.
4. **Lymphoma** - A malignant tumor of the lymphatic system which can present as a neck mass.
5. **Fibrosarcoma** - A malignant tumor derived from fibrous connective tissue, can occur in the soft tissues of the neck.
6. **Lipoma** - A benign tumor of fat cells that could potentially ossify or calcify after trauma.
7. **Branchial Cleft Cyst** - A congenital epithelial cyst that can present as a neck mass.
8. **Ectopic Thyroid Tissue** - Misplaced thyroid tissue that might become palpable and present as a neck mass.
9. **Schwannoma** - A benign nerve sheath tumor that can occur in various regions including the neck.
10. **Cervical Rib** - An extra rib originating from the cervical vertebra, potentially misinterpreted as a mass particularly when ossified.

### Reranking Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Myositis Ossificans** - Most likely due to trauma history, firm and tender mass, well-circumscribed lesion with dense acoustic shadowing, and ossification noted in CT.
2. **Osteoma** - Consideration due to bone formation in the mass post-trauma, though less common in soft tissue.
3. **Schwannoma** - Mobile, encapsulated mass presenting in the posterior triangle, though usually not ossified.
4. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - Malignant and rare, less likely given encapsulated and well-circumscribed nature.
5. **Fibrosarcoma** - Malignant with irregular character, though less likely due to trauma history and presentation.
6. **Branchial Cleft Cyst** - Congenital and common in neck, but typically cystic and not firm or tender.
7. **Lymphoma** - Malignant, can present as mass; however, less likely due to presentation and imaging findings.
8. **Lipoma** - Common and usually benign but would be unusual to ossify significantly.
9. **Ectopic Thyroid Tissue** - Uncommon in this presentation and location, typically asymptomatic or presenting differently.
10. **Cervical Rib** - Possible but less likely given the mass was separate from the underlying bone per CT findings.","['Otolaryngology', 'Pediatrics', 'Clinical Challenge', 'Trauma and Injury']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1.0,F

### INPUT:
A 1-week-old, full-term male newborn presented with increasingly labored breathing, xerostomia, and poor bowel movements. He had been born after an uncomplicated pregnancy, during which routine prenatal ultrasonography had not detected any anatomical abnormalities or lesions. On physical examination, there were no abnormalities other than symmetrical submucosal swelling of the floor of the mouth and a midline external punctum present in the submental area (Figure, A). The tongue was displaced posteriorly and superiorly. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the neck and face performed shortly after presentation showed a midline sublingual lesion extending inferiorly through the mylohyoid muscle (Figure, B-D). The intrinsic muscles of the tongue appeared minimally displaced without obvious infiltration; however, the genioglossus muscle was difficult to locate relative to the mass. A thin-walled, multiloculated lesion was identified, measuring approximately 2.0 × 2.5 × 3.2 cm. The mass was bright on T2-weighted imaging and dark on T1-weighted imaging and did not enhance with intravenous gadolinium. There were no obvious fluid-fluid levels or calcifications. When in-phase and out-of-phase images were compared, there was no significant signal intensity drop, suggesting an absence of fat within the lesion. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cystic teratoma (mature),"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Ranula**: This is a type of mucocele found on the floor of the mouth due to rupture of a salivary gland duct.
2. **Congenital Dermoid Cyst**: Given the location and sub-midline presentation, a dermoid cyst should be considered.
3. **Cystic Hygroma**: A congenital lymphatic malformation that can present as a multiloculated cystic lesion.
4. **Oral Teratoma**: A rare tumor that can contain multiple types of tissues and can appear cystic.
5. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**: A congenital anomaly that can present as a midline neck cyst.
6. **Epidermoid Cyst**: Can present as a painless, slow-growing mass in the floor of the mouth.
7. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**: Although rare, can present with a cystic mass in neonates.
8. **Sublingual Salivary Gland Tumor**: Rare, but can present with a midline cystic mass.
9. **Infectious Cyst (Abscess)**: Potentially secondary to an infectious process, though less likely given the lack of acute inflammatory signs.
10. **Cystic Schwannoma**: A neural tumor that could present as a cystic lesion.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis (Based on All Information and Test Results)

1. **Ranula**: The presenting symptoms and imaging characteristics (thin-walled, multiloculated lesion, T2-bright and T1-dark, no signal drop indicating fat) are classic for a ranula.
2. **Congenital Dermoid Cyst**: The location (midline sublingual) supports this diagnosis; however, ranula fits better with T2 and T1 imaging features.
3. **Cystic Hygroma**: The multiloculated nature fits, but it often has a more diffuse, less confined presentation.
4. **Thyroglossal Duct Cyst**: Midline location supports this, but it typically has a fistula extending superiorly, not fitting this case perfectly.
5. **Oral Teratoma**: Consideration due to the midline presentation, though less likely given the absence of mixed tissue types on imaging.
6. **Epidermoid Cyst**: Similar presentation to dermoid, but less likely compared to ranula and dermoid.
7. **Sublingual Salivary Gland Tumor**: Rarer, but needs consideration for any sublingual mass.
8. **Cystic Schwannoma**: Less likely given the common presentations differ from the reported imaging findings.
9. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**: Very rare with less fitting characteristics for this specific case.
10. **Infectious Cyst (Abscess)**: Least likely, given the lack of signs indicating an infection or inflammation.

### INPUT:
A 50-year-old woman with hypertension, diabetes, and allergies presented to the ophthalmology clinic for an evaluation of uveitis after experiencing 9 months of eye redness and pain that started in her right eye and involved both eyes within a few months. The patient had a history of asthma and had recently been hospitalized after radiologic findings of pulmonary infiltrates. The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia, myocarditis, and hypereosinophilic syndrome and received high-dose intravenous corticosteroids. At hospital discharge, the patient’s medications were changed to prednisone, 11 mg orally once daily, and azathioprine, 100 mg orally once daily. Although the severity of the ocular symptoms was variable, there was no improvement with the described medication regimen or with currently prescribed topical corticosteroids given 4 times daily in both eyes. The patient denied rash, headache, and joint pain. Serologic testing ruled out infectious causes of inflammation. On examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OU. Intraocular pressure for the right eye was 16 mm Hg and for the left eye was 24 mm Hg. Slitlamp examination showed trace hyperemia of the right eye and 2+ diffuse scleral hyperemia of the left eye (Figure). Corneas were clear bilaterally, and sensitivity was symmetric and full. There was no cell or flare in the anterior chamber, and she had clear lenses with normal irises. The fundus examination was unremarkable bilaterally with no vitreous cell or haze, a flat macula, a cup-disc ratio of 0.3, and a peripheral retina without holes or tears. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Churg-Strauss syndrome (eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis),"### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Sarcoidosis** - Commonly associated with uveitis and can produce pulmonary infiltrates.
2. **Behçet's Disease** - Can present with uveitis and is also known to cause cardiovascular problems such as myocarditis.
3. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Syndrome** - This autoimmune disease can present with chronic bilateral uveitis.
4. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - Known to cause ocular manifestations and systemic symptoms.
5. **Tubulointerstitial Nephritis and Uveitis (TINU) Syndrome** - Common cause of uveitis that fits with systemic symptoms.
6. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - Vasculitis that may present with pulmonary infiltrates and uveitis.
7. **Multiple Sclerosis** - Can present with optic neuritis and other ocular signs.
8. **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) in Adults** - Rare but can cause chronic uveitis.
9. **Syphilis** - Can present with uveitis and systemic symptoms, but serologic testing was negative.
10. **Lyme Disease** - Can cause uveitis but usually associated with rash and joint pain, which are absent.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis (based on all patient information and test results):

1. **Sarcoidosis** - Fits best with pulmonary involvement and chronic uveitis, and can explain systemic symptoms.
2. **Behçet's Disease** - Consistent with uveitis and cardiovascular symptoms but lack of rash or oral/genital ulcers makes it less likely.
3. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis** - Fits pulmonary and uveitis presentation well but needs deeper investigation.
4. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Syndrome** - Compatible with chronic uveitis but less likely without meningitis or other findings.
5. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)** - Fits ocular symptoms but less compelling without rash or joint pain.
6. **Tubulointerstitial Nephritis and Uveitis (TINU) Syndrome** - Considered but less likely without renal involvement.
7. **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) in Adults** - Uncommon and less likely in this age group.
8. **Multiple Sclerosis** - Unlikely without neurologic symptoms.
9. **Syphilis** - Ruled out by serologic testing.
10. **Lyme Disease** - Less likely without classic symptoms and negative serology.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy man in his 30s presented with a 5-day history of fever, anorexia, and rash. Five days before arrival, he developed throat pain, rhinorrhea, nonproductive cough, and fever. Two days later he noticed a maculopapular rash on his neck and trunk, which later involved his upper and lower extremities. He did not smoke and only drank alcohol occasionally. He was living in Japan and recently visited a neighboring island but denied any international travel. On examination, his blood pressure was 142/84 mm Hg; temperature, 38.3°C; pulse, 91/min; respiratory rate, 24/min; and oxygen saturation, 97% on ambient air. He was alert and oriented. There were no mucosal lesions or conjunctival injection. A maculopapular rash was noted on the trunk and extremities (Figure) as well as the palms and soles. The face was not involved. The lungs were clear to auscultation. No hepatosplenomegaly was noted. Neurologic examination, including results of motor, sensory, and reflex testing, was unremarkable. There was no neck stiffness or lymphadenopathy. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 2900/μL (80% neutrophils, 13% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, 0% eosinophils, and 0% basophils); hemoglobin level, 15.2 g/dL; and platelet count, 187 ×103/μL. Serum electrolyte levels were normal. Aspartate aminotransferase level was 635 U/L (10.6 μkat/L); alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 491 U/L (8.2 μkat/L); lactate dehydrogenase, 807 U/L (13.48 μkat/L); γ-glutamyltransferase, 329 U/L (5.49 μkat/L); and bilirubin, 1.3 mg/dL (22.24 μmol/L). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Measles,"Sure, let's go through the differential diagnosis step-by-step for the patient described.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Viral Exanthem**: Considering the maculopapular rash and fever, a viral exanthem could be one of the initial considerations. Common viruses include measles, rubella, and other viral infections that present with fever and rash.

2. **Dengue Fever**: Given the geographical location (Japan with a visit to a nearby island) and symptoms of fever, maculopapular rash, and thrombocytopenia, dengue fever is a possible differential.

3. **Kawasaki Disease**: The patient’s presentation of fever, rash, and elevated liver enzymes could also suggest Kawasaki disease, especially in the absence of mucosal involvement and conjunctival injection.

4. **Drug Reaction**: A drug-induced reaction, including a drug hypersensitivity syndrome, is plausible given the rash and elevated liver enzymes.

5. **Rickettsial Infection**: Considering the outdoors exposure and geographical history, rickettsial infections like scrub typhus should be considered.

6. **Hepatitis A**: The elevated liver enzymes and fever with rash suggest a possible hepatitis outbreak, and given his local travel history, hepatitis A virus could be a consideration.

7. **Infectious Mononucleosis**: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) can present with fever, lymphocytosis (atypical lymphocytes), and elevated liver enzymes.

8. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: Although less likely due to the acute nature, SLE can present with fever, rash, and elevated liver enzymes.

9. **Vasculitis**: Systemic vasculitides can present with fever, rash, and multiorgan involvement, including liver dysfunction.

10. **Typhoid Fever**: Typhoid fever presents with a continuous fever, rash, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated liver enzymes.

### Reranking Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Dengue Fever**
2. **Rickettsial Infection (e.g., Scrub Typhus)**
3. **Viral Exanthem**
4. **Drug Reaction**
5. **Hepatitis A**
6. **Typhoid Fever**
7. **Infectious Mononucleosis (EBV/CMV)**
8. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
9. **Kawasaki Disease**
10. **Vasculitis**

### Analysis:

- **Dengue Fever** ranks highest due to geographical location, classic presentation with fever, rash, and consistent lab abnormalities (leukopenia, elevated liver enzymes).
- **Rickettsial Infection** is highly consistent with the exposure history and symptomatology.
- **Viral Exanthem** remains a likely cause given the presence of fever and rash, though further history and specific testing are needed.
- **Drug Reaction** is considered, but no specific drug history is noted.
- **Hepatitis A** is possible given the elevated liver enzymes but might be less likely without specific risk factors or history of jaundice.
- **Typhoid Fever** is a possibility, albeit less common in Japan, the recent travel to an island raises suspicion.
- **Infectious Mononucleosis** and **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus** have features overlapping with the patient’s symptoms but lack some characteristic findings.
- **Kawasaki Disease** and **Vasculitis** are less likely given the age and lack of specific supportive findings.

### INPUT:
A woman in her mid-60s with a history of breast cancer (status post lumpectomy 7 years earlier [N0, M0]) and benign thyroid nodules presented for evaluation of right-sided proptosis. Bulging of the right eye was first noted 6 months earlier elsewhere when she reported progressive proptosis, worsening vision, and tearing in the right eye. She did not report any pain or diplopia. Visual acuity was 20/150 OD (no improvement with pinhole) and 20/20 OS. Pupillary reaction and confrontational visual fields were normal. External examination was notable for proptosis of 7 mm, hypoglobus, and resistance to retropulsion. A firm, nontender mass was palpable in the right superotemporal orbit. The palpebral lobe of the right lacrimal gland was erythematous and prominent compared with the normal-appearing left lacrimal gland. Ocular motility showed −2 abduction deficit, right eye. Slitlamp examination revealed pseudophakia and posterior capsular opacification (right > left), but was otherwise normal. Sensation was normal in the V1, V2 distribution, and there was no preauricular, submandibular, or anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. Computed tomographic scan of the orbits without contrast from an outside facility revealed a spherical mass of unclear cause in the area of the right lacrimal gland. No lytic bone changes or bone remodeling could be seen (Figure 1). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Solitary fibrous tumor,"Let's develop a 10-step differential diagnosis for the woman presenting with right-sided proptosis, considering her history and clinical presentation.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Orbital Metastasis**: Given her history of breast cancer, metastatic disease should be considered.
2. **Lacrimal Gland Tumor**: Primary lacrimal gland tumors, such as pleomorphic adenoma or adenoid cystic carcinoma.
3. **Orbital Lymphoma**: Common in older adults, presents as a painless, progressive orbital mass.
4. **Thyroid Eye Disease (Graves’ Orbitopathy)**: Common cause of proptosis, though typically bilateral and she has benign thyroid nodules.
5. **Orbital Pseudotumor (Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation)**: A benign inflammatory condition that can mimic neoplasms.
6. **Chronic Dacryoadenitis**: Chronic inflammation of the lacrimal gland which can present similarly.
7. **Sarcoidosis**: Can affect the orbit leading to chronic granulomatous inflammation.
8. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**: Can present with orbital involvement.
9. **Mucormycosis/Rhino-Orbital-Cerebral Mucormycosis**: Aggressive fungal infection, especially relevant in immunocompromised patients.
10. **Orbital Cellulitis**: Although more acute and often painful, with accompanying systemic symptoms.

### Re-ranked Differential Diagnosis

After carefully reconsidering all clinical findings, history, and provided data:

1. **Lacrimal Gland Tumor**: The palpable, firm mass with no bone remodeling is most suggestive of this primary entity.
2. **Orbital Metastasis**: Given her past breast cancer history, secondary involvement is plausible.
3. **Orbital Lymphoma**: Given the patient's age and the presentation of a firm mass.
4. **Thyroid Eye Disease (Graves’ Orbitopathy)**: Less likely due to asymmetry and less common in those without thyroid function abnormalities.
5. **Orbital Pseudotumor (Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation)**: Proptosis with resistance to retropulsion could be inflammation.
6. **Chronic Dacryoadenitis**: Chronic condition affecting the lacrimal gland, though less common.
7. **Sarcoidosis**: May consider given multi-system inflammatory conditions.
8. **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)**: Systemic vasculitis that can involve the orbit.
9. **Mucormycosis/Rhino-Orbital-Cerebral Mucormycosis**: Less likely without immune compromise.
10. **Orbital Cellulitis**: Unlikely due to the absence of pain, fever, and acute onset.

### INPUT:
A 6-year-old boy presented with several tumoral lesions on sun-exposed skin. These lesions developed from local freckles beginning at 6 months of age and gradually spread with protruding growth. Over the past 2 years, tumors started to form and develop rapidly, becoming ulcerative and bleeding. The patient was intellectually standard and denied blurred vision, impaired hearing, or any other systemic symptoms. He lived in a remote area in China. His parents were first cousins, but no similar cutaneous presentation was reported by other relatives. The physical examination revealed scaly skin with diffuse warty lesions on sun-exposed areas. The patient’s face was severely disfigured, with numerous ulcerative, malodorous tumors (Figure 1A). The general examination findings, including neurological and ophthalmologic tests, were unremarkable. The lesional discharge culture revealed infection with Proteus vulgaris. Punch biopsy of a paranasal mass was performed (Figure 1B). Craniofacial computed tomography showed heterogenous soft tissue masses located superficially without bony invasion. No signs of cerebral atrophy were noticed. Genetic testing was advised but was declined. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Xeroderma pigmentosum,"### Differential Diagnosis Step-by-Step

1. **Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP)**  
   - Characterized by extreme sensitivity to UV rays from sunlight, leading to a high risk of skin cancer.

2. **Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome (Gorlin Syndrome)**  
   - Presents with multiple basal cell carcinomas, often in childhood, along with palmar and plantar pits.

3. **Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome (RTS)**  
   - Involves poikiloderma (skin changes including telangiectasia, pigment changes), with sun sensitivity, along with potential skeletal anomalies.

4. **Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis (EV)**  
   - A rare genetic disorder leading to an abnormal susceptibility to human papillomaviruses, presenting as wart-like lesions that can develop into skin cancer.

5. **Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS)**  
   - Characterized by oculocutaneous albinism with bleeding disorders, the skin may show an increased risk of cancer but also involves systemic symptoms.

6. **Bloom Syndrome**  
   - Features include sun-sensitive skin changes, growth deficiency, and a predisposition to various types of cancer.

7. **Fanconi Anemia**  
   - Manifests with congenital abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and an increased susceptibility to cancers but more commonly involves hematologic complications.

8. **Kindler Syndrome**  
   - A form of epidermolysis bullosa manifesting with skin fragility, blistering in sun-exposed areas, and increased skin cancer risks.

9. **Dyskeratosis Congenita**  
   - Presents with mucocutaneous abnormalities, nail dystrophy, and leukoplakia, along with predisposition to malignancies but involves bone marrow failure.

10. **Werner Syndrome**  
    - An adult-onset disorder; patients usually present with premature aging and increased cancer risk, making it less likely but worth considering given the familial aspect of consanguinity.

### Re-Ranking Based on All Information

1. **Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP)**  
   - The early onset of symptoms (as a baby) and lesions in sun-exposed areas with rapid tumor formation strongly support this diagnosis.

2. **Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis (EV)**  
   - Multiple wart-like lesions progressing to cancer in sun-exposed areas.

3. **Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome (Gorlin Syndrome)**  
   - Early onset of multiple tumors consistent with basal cell carcinoma.

4. **Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome (RTS)**  
   - Sun sensitivity with resultant skin changes but typically involves other systemic symptoms.

5. **Bloom Syndrome**  
   - Sun-sensitive skin with an increased cancer risk, however, usually involves growth deficiency as well.

6. **Kindler Syndrome**  
   - Skin fragility and increased cancer risk but also involves blistering which is not described here.

7. **Fanconi Anemia**  
   - Increased cancer risk but usually involves hematologic symptoms which are not present.

8. **Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS)**  
   - Involves systemic symptoms including bleeding disorders which are absent in this patient.

9. **Dyskeratosis Congenita**  
   - Predisposition to cancer but involves more pronounced mucocutaneous abnormalities.

10. **Werner Syndrome**  
    - Less likely due to the typical adult-onset nature of the disease and the absence of premature aging signs.

A 63-year-old healthy woman presented with a 3-week history of fluctuating left eye swelling and redness. She also reported a 1-week history of left eye discomfort and left-sided tinnitus and a 1-day history of binocular horizontal diplopia. She denied any history of recent trauma. Ophthalmologic examination at the time revealed visual acuities of 20/30 OD and 20/40 OS. Intraocular pressures were 15 mm Hg OD and 21 mm Hg OS, with a widened pulse pressure of the left eye. Extraocular motility revealed a left eye abduction deficit. Pupils and confrontational visual fields were unremarkable. Hertel measured 16 mm and 17 mm, respectively. Slitlamp examination of the right eye was unremarkable, but examination of the left eye revealed a large subconjunctival hemorrhage and engorged episcleral veins (Figure 1).

### OUTPUT:
    ",Dural cavernous fistula,"Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, a differential diagnosis can be approached step-by-step. 

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula (CCF)**: This condition can cause fluctuating eye swelling, redness, and symptoms of elevated intraocular pressure due to abnormal arterial flow directly into the cavernous sinus.
2. **Orbital Cellulitis**: Though less likely in an afebrile, healthy individual, it should be considered with eye swelling and redness.
3. **Thyroid Eye Disease (TED)**: Often presents with eyelid retraction, eye redness, and swelling, and can mimic these ocular symptoms.
4. **Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis**: May present with eye swelling, diplopia, and engorged veins, often associated with severe headache.
5. **Orbital Tumor**: Such as a hemangioma or lymphoma, which might cause gradual onset of proptosis and diplopia.
6. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome (Orbital Pseudotumor)**: Presents with eye pain, swelling, and diplopia without infection.
7. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome**: Characterized by painful ophthalmoplegia and cavernous sinus involvement.
8. **Myasthenia Gravis**: Can cause fluctuating diplopia and ptosis, although lacking the characteristic swelling and redness.
9. **Orbital Varix**: A vascular malformation that can cause intermittent proptosis and eye swelling.
10. **Sjogren's Syndrome**: Can lead to chronic conjunctivitis and episcleritis, although systemic symptoms are typically present.

### Re-ranked Differential Diagnosis:
After taking all patient information and examination findings into account, especially the presence of subconjunctival hemorrhage, engorged episcleral veins, left eye abduction deficit, elevated intraocular pressure, and the widened pulse pressure of the affected eye, the differential diagnosis is refined as follows:

1. **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula (CCF)**: The most likely diagnosis given the specific vascular signs and symptoms.
2. **Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis**: Considered due to the involvement of cranial nerves and vascular congestion.
3. **Orbital Cellulitis**: Still possible despite the lack of systemic signs of infection.
4. **Orbital Tumor**: Given the proptosis and motility issue, though less acutely presenting than CCF.
5. **Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome (Orbital Pseudotumor)**: Possible, but less common without acute pain and systemic signs.
6. **Thyroid Eye Disease (TED)**: Somewhat less likely due to the lack of systemic thyroid issues.
7. **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome**: Less likely without the characteristic pain and less specific findings.
8. **Myasthenia Gravis**: Unlikely given the vascular and structural findings.
9. **Orbital Varix**: Unlikely due to the acute nature and additional systemic signs needed.
10. **Sjogren's Syndrome**: Not consistent with the acute and unilateral presentation.","['Ophthalmology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Audiology and Hearing']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,63.0,F

### INPUT:
An otherwise healthy woman in her 30s presented to an outside health care professional with a 2-day history of floaters in her left eye. She denied additional ocular symptoms and reported no relevant medical, ocular, or family history; medication use; or allergies. The findings of a review of systems were unremarkable. A workup for posterior uveitis was initiated, and the patient began therapy with oral antiviral and oral corticosteroid medications. One week later, her symptoms had worsened, and she was referred for consultation. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/15 OD and 20/60 OS. Intraocular pressures, extraocular movements, visual fields by confrontation, and pupil responses were normal. Anterior segment examination and dilated fundus examination of the right eye had normal findings. However, the left eye had 3+ anterior chamber cell and 1+ flare, nongranulomatous keratic precipitates, and a clear lens. The dilated fundus examination revealed 2+ vitritis, a hyperemic disc with blurred margins, macular striae with a blunted foveal reflex, and vascular sheathing with segmental periarteriolar inflammatory plaques in multiple quadrants. The peripheral retina had well-demarcated peripheral retinal whitening with scalloped margins and intraretinal hemorrhages in all quadrants (Figure 1A and B). Four days later, repeat fundus photography showed that the peripheral lesions had coalesced into larger circumferential necrotic regions (Figure 1C). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Acute retinal necrosis,"Let's go through the differential diagnosis step by step:

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Acute Retinal Necrosis (ARN)**
   - Given the peripheral retinal whitening, necrosis with scalloped margins, and symptoms worsening despite antiviral/corticosteroid therapy, ARN is a leading consideration. 

2. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis (CMV Retinitis)**
   - Retinal whitening and necrotic changes, although more common in immunocompromised individuals, can present similarly in rare instances.

3. **Toxoplasmosis Retinochoroiditis**
   - Given vitritis and inflammatory plaques, Toxoplasmosis should be considered, even in a previously healthy individual.

4. **Syphilitic Uveitis**
   - Syphilis can cause similar retinal presentations including retinitis and vitritis.

5. **Tuberculosis (TB) Uveitis**
   - While less common, TB can present with pan-uveitis and necrotizing retinitis.

6. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Systemic inflammatory disease that can lead to ocular manifestations such as vitritis and retinal changes.

7. **Behçet’s Disease**
   - Auto-inflammatory syndrome with potential for severe panuveitis affecting retina and blood vessels.

8. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**
   - Can cause retinal issues; optic neuritis is more common but chorioretinitis can occur.

9. **Birdshot Chorioretinopathy**
   - A potential although rare possibility characterized by inflammation and retinal changes.

10. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease (VKH)**
    - Multisystemic disorder that can present with panuveitis and chorioretinitis.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Acute Retinal Necrosis (ARN)**
   - Most consistent with clinical findings of necrotic regions, vitritis, and posterior segment involvement. Worsening symptoms despite treatment fit ARN pathology.

2. **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis (CMV Retinitis)**
   - Progressive necrotic retinal changes, but primary consideration in immunocompromised individuals.

3. **Toxoplasmosis Retinochoroiditis**
   - Inflammatory retina changes with vitritis align with Toxoplasmosis presentation.

4. **Syphilitic Uveitis**
   - Differentially less likely but consistent clinical features and should be ruled out with serologies.

5. **Tuberculosis (TB) Uveitis**
   - Consistent with granulomatous disease processes affecting the retina, more common in endemic regions.

6. **Behçet’s Disease**
   - Less likely given no systemic symptoms reported but includes retinal vessel involvement.

7. **Sarcoidosis**
   - Systemic inflammatory disease could cause such retinal manifestations but less common as isolated occurrence.

8. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease (VKH)**
   - Different form of panuveitis but possible, needs exclusion via systemic symptom review.

9. **Birdshot Chorioretinopathy**
   - Uncommon but includes posterior segment inflammation.

10. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**
    - Least likely but presents with neuroophthalmological symptoms involving the retina and optic nerve.

### Conclusion:
Given the progression of symptoms and retinal features, **Acute Retinal Necrosis (ARN)** is the most likely diagnosis. Immediate re-evaluation and potentially histopathological confirmation via aqueous or vitreous humor sampling could confirm diagnosis and guide more intensive therapy.","['Ophthalmology', 'Retinal Disorders']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,30.0,F

### INPUT:
A white man in his mid-80s with an ocular history of remote left cataract extraction and a medical history of well-controlled hypertension, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, and osteoporosis was referred by an outside optometrist for possible birdshot chorioretinopathy. He denied any vision changes, eye pain, or light sensitivity. A comprehensive review of symptoms was negative, including no fatigue, weight loss, or night sweats. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/30 OS. Anterior segment examination revealed ocular surface dryness and a nuclear sclerotic cataract in the right eye. On dilated fundoscopy, multiple yellow-white subretinal deposits were scattered throughout the left posterior pole, with parafoveal coalescence but sparing the far periphery. There was no concomitant vitritis (Figure, A). Optical coherence tomography showed choroidal thickening and irregularity of the overlying retinal pigment epithelium (Figure, B). The right eye was unremarkable. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Waldenström macroglobulinemia,"Sure, let's proceed with a stepwise differential diagnosis list:

1. **Birdshot Chorioretinopathy** (BSCR)
2. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration** (AMD)
3. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy** (CSCR)
4. **Sarcoidosis**
5. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Disease**
6. **Primary Intraocular Lymphoma** (PIOL)
7. **Multifocal Choroiditis** (MFC)
8. **Tuberculosis-associated Chorioretinitis**
9. **Syphilitic Chorioretinitis**
10. **Ocular Histoplasmosis Syndrome** (OHS)

### Reranking with Patient Information and Test Results:
Taking into account the detailed history, clinical presentation, and imaging studies:

1. **Birdshot Chorioretinopathy** (BSCR) - The initial impression from the referring optometrist, presence of multiple yellow-white subretinal deposits, and choroidal thickening make BSCR very likely.
2. **Age-Related Macular Degeneration** (AMD) - While AMD is common in older adults and can present with subretinal deposits, the description here (parafoveal coalescence sparing the periphery without vitritis) favors BSCR more.
3. **Sarcoidosis** - Can present with choroidal lesions but usually accompanied by other systemic symptoms or ocular signs such as granulomas or vitritis.
4. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Disease** - Typically presents with ocular inflammation including vitritis or serous retinal detachment, which is not seen here.
5. **Multifocal Choroiditis** (MFC) - Presents similarly with multiple choroidal lesions but more commonly associated with vitritis and not as characteristic parafoveal coalescence.
6. **Primary Intraocular Lymphoma** (PIOL) - May present with subretinal deposits but more often involves vitritis or subretinal infiltrates.
7. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy** (CSCR) - Typically presents with serous retinal detachment rather than subretinal deposits.
8. **Tuberculosis-associated Chorioretinitis** - Requires systemic evidence or positive tests for TB, not apparent in this non-symptomatic patient.
9. **Syphilitic Chorioretinitis** - Although possible without systemic symptoms, the fundoscopic and imaging findings are not classic of syphilis.
10. **Ocular Histoplasmosis Syndrome** (OHS) - Characterized by punched-out chorioretinal scars or lesions in the periphery, not matching the described presentation.

Taking into consideration the detailed ocular findings and history, Birdshot Chorioretinopathy remains the most plausible primary diagnosis. Further diagnostic testing, including HLA-A29 typing, could help confirm the diagnosis.","['Ophthalmology', 'Intraocular Inflammation', 'Retinal Disorders']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,85.0,M

### INPUT:
A farmer in his 50s presented with bilateral periauricular swelling that began 6 months prior (Figure 1). The swelling was mild at onset and gradually progressive. There was no history of associated pain, but he reported occasional pruritus over the swelling. There was no history of fever, weight loss, or loss of appetite. He denied any history of similar swelling elsewhere in his body. General physical and systemic examination had normal results. On examination of the swelling on the right side, there was a diffuse swelling around the pinna measuring approximately 6 cm over the preauricular, postauricular, and infra-auricular region. It was a nontender, soft swelling without fluctuation and abnormal pulsations. There were similar findings in the left side. Mouth opening was adequate, secretions from both parotid ducts were normal, and facial nerve function was intact on both sides. He had undergone fine-needle aspiration cytology and incisional biopsy. The results of both were consistent with reactive lymphadenitis. He was prescribed oral antibiotics for 1 week but showed no improvement. A contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan of the head and neck showed bilateral multiple enhancing lymph nodes in the postauricular region, the largest measuring 16 × 11 mm2 on the right side and 15.4 × 10.6 mm2 on the left, along with bilateral intraparotid nodes, the largest measuring 16.4 × 10.2 mm2 on the right and 15.3 × 10.7 mm2 on the left side. His serum eosinophil count was slightly elevated, and his erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 15 mm/h. However, the IgE level was not measured. He was then scheduled for excisional biopsy at our center. The biopsy specimen included skin and subcutaneous tissue along with 2 underlying lymph nodes. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Kimura disease,"Sure, let's work through the differential diagnosis systematically, step by step, considering the available patient information.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Warthin's Tumor**
2. **Parotid Gland Tumor**
3. **Sarcoidosis**
4. **Lymphoma**
5. **Sjogren's Syndrome**
6. **Kimura Disease**
7. **Castleman Disease**
8. **Tuberculosis (Atypical Mycobacterial Infection)**
9. **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)**
10. **Benign Reactive Lymphadenitis**

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Summary Using Full Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Benign Reactive Lymphadenitis**: Although initially not improved with antibiotics, continued inflammation suggests reactive lymphadenitis, retaining a high differential priority.
   
2. **Kimura Disease**: The chronic, bilateral nature of the swelling with mild pruritus, eosinophilia, and the presence of multiple large reactive nodes align well with this diagnosis.

3. **Warthin's Tumor**: Given the swelling involves the parotid region and patient's age, this benign tumor of the salivary gland is still a consideration.

4. **Sarcoidosis**: Bilateral lymph node involvement without systemic signs like fever or significant changes in appetite or weight points towards sarcoid-like involvement.

5. **Lymphoma**: Though he lacks B-symptoms, the persistent, progressive nature of lymphadenopathy warrants consideration of this malignancy.

6. **Sjogren's Syndrome**: Salivary gland involvement bilateral with swelling raises the possibility, although typically accompanied by dry mouth and dry eyes.

7. **Parotid Gland Tumor**: Another salivary gland tumor apart from Warthin's, given the location involved.

8. **Castleman Disease**: This presents with multiple enlarged lymph nodes and can be similarly indolent but progressive.

9. **Tuberculosis (Atypical Mycobacterial Infection)**: Uncommon in this region but still possible given chronic progression and exposure risk.

10. **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)**: Chronic lymphadenopathy with slight change in blood markers like ESR could suggest a hematologic malignancy.

Upon considering this, further specific tests such as IgE level measurement, additional specific serologic tests, flow cytometry for lymphocyte markers, and detailed histopathological examination of biopsy tissue would be essential to differentiate among these conditions accurately.","['Otolaryngology', 'Salivary Gland Disorders', 'Dental Medicine']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,50.0,M

### INPUT:
A 60-year-old man with a history of IgA kappa multiple myeloma was referred to our department. He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma 2 years earlier after discovery of osteolytic bone lesions of the skull and the findings of a bone marrow biopsy. The patient had been treated with bortezomib and dexamethasone followed by autologous blood progenitor cell transplantation, which resulted in complete response. At the time of the consultation, he was free of disease. The patient was referred for evaluation of an indolent, erythematous papule on his glans penis of 2 weeks’ duration. He denied sexual risk behavior and reported no recent changes in medication. Careful physical examination revealed a shiny, tense, erythematous, hemispherical papule measuring 5 mm in diameter located on the lateral aspect of the glans (Figure 1A). There were no other skin lesions. The lymph nodes were not palpable, and there was no organomegaly. A punch biopsy was performed for histopathological evaluation (Figure 1B and C). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Plasmacytoma,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Bowen's Disease**: Given the presentation of an erythematous papule on the glans penis in an older male, this pre-cancerous condition should be considered.
   
2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Persistent, indolent erythematous papule can be indicative of early SCC, especially on sun-exposed or sensitive areas.

3. **Zoon's Balanitis**: Chronic inflammation conditions such as Zoon's balanitis may appear as erythematous, shiny lesions on the glans penis.

4. **Lichen Planus**: This condition can present as shiny, flat-topped reddish-purple papules and plaques, often on mucosal surfaces including the genital area.

5. **Condyloma Acuminatum**: Although the patient denies sexual risk behaviors, HPV-related lesions can present as erythematous papules.

6. **Extramammary Paget’s Disease**: This rare cancer typically presents with pruritic, erythematous lesions and is included in differential for genital lesions.

7. **Plasmacytoma (extramedullary)**: Given the patient's history of multiple myeloma, secondary malignant lesions like plasmacytomas should be considered.

8. **Psoriasis**: Genital psoriasis can present with erythematous, well-demarcated and shiny plaques.

9. **Melanoma**: While rarer in this location, mucosal melanoma can present as an erythematous to bluish black lesion.

10. **Syphilis (primary)**: A painless chancre from primary syphilis can present as an indolent papule, though less likely without sexual risk behavior.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis after Reviewing All Collected Information and Test Results:

1. **Bowen's Disease**: Still a top contender given the appearance and localization of the lesion along with histopathological findings needed.
   
2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: High on the list due to the persistent nature of the lesion and classic presentation on the glans penis.

3. **Plasmacytoma (extramedullary)**: Patient’s history of multiple myeloma necessitates consideration of this diagnosis.

4. **Zoon's Balanitis**: Less likely but still possible given solitary, shiny, erythematous appearance.

5. **Lichen Planus**: The presentation aligns well with common appearances of this condition though needs histopath confirmation.

6. **Extramammary Paget’s Disease**: Less likely but considered due to persistent erythematous lesions on genitalia.

7. **Condyloma Acuminatum**: Less likely without sexual risk history but still possible as asymptomatic carrier.

8. **Psoriasis**: The presentation fits but slightly less probable given patient history and lesion characteristics.

9. **Syphilis (primary)**: Unlikely due to absence of sexual risk behavior and other symptoms.

10. **Melanoma**: Least likely but mucosal melanoma remains a differential in persistent atypical genital lesions.

### INPUT:
A man in his 50s with a history of chronic hepatitis C, hypothyroidism, and alcoholism presented to the outpatient clinic complaining of nasal congestion and epistaxis. Nonenhanced computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses revealed a soft-tissue mass extending from the nasopharynx into the left sphenoid sinus with erosion of the sphenoid sinus floor and the clivus (Figure 1A). The sella was apparently normal with no disruption of its floor. The intracranial and orbital soft tissues were grossly normal, as were the remaining soft tissues under the skull base. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Ectopic pituitary adenoma,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Sinonasal carcinoma**: Considering the presence of a soft-tissue mass with bone erosion, a malignancy such as sinonasal carcinoma could be a primary concern.
2. **Inverted papilloma**: This benign tumor can present as a nasal mass with possible bone erosion and might transform into malignancy if not treated.
3. **Nasopharyngeal carcinoma**: Given the mass extends from the nasopharynx, nasopharyngeal carcinoma is another critical consideration.
4. **Adenoid cystic carcinoma**: This can present with similar symptoms and radiological findings, including bone erosion.
5. **Rosai-Dorfman disease**: Rare but possible, presenting as a mass with bone destruction, known for extensive lymph node involvement.
6. **Esthesioneuroblastoma**: Originating from the olfactory epithelium, this rare tumor can extend into sinuses and cause erosion.
7. **Chondrosarcoma**: A bone and cartilage tumor which can erode into surrounding features of the sinuses and skull base.
8. **Lymphoma**: Given the systemic nature and possible involvement of various tissues, lymphoma engaging sinuses is possible.
9. **Wegener's granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis)**: Systemic vasculitis could be expressed by sinus mass and bone erosion.
10. **Fungal sinusitis**: Chronic invasive fungal infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients, have the potential for bone erosion and mass formation.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Sinonasal carcinoma**: High likelihood given the mass and significant bone erosion; commonly seen in patients with risk factors like chronic inflammation from hepatitis and alcoholism.
2. **Nasopharyngeal carcinoma**: Fits well with the location and characteristics of the mass, especially considering the patient's age.
3. **Inverted papilloma**: Needs consideration due to presentation of a sinonasal mass and possible malignant transformation.
4. **Adenoid cystic carcinoma**: Given the erosion patterns and the potential for local destruction.
5. **Lymphoma**: Immunocompromised status from comorbidities might increase the risk.
6. **Esthesioneuroblastoma**: Needs consideration but less common.
7. **Wegener's granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis)**: Systemic condition that could present in this manner, although less likely without more systemic symptoms.
8. **Rosai-Dorfman disease**: Uncommon but possible, especially with idiopathic mass lesions.
9. **Chondrosarcoma**: Bone lesion that expands into sinus cavity, though less common compared to other malignancies.
10. **Fungal sinusitis**: Less likely without significant immunodeficiency and more common signs of fungal infection.","['Radiology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Rhinology and Sinus Disease', 'Clinical Decision Support', 'Endocrinology']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50.0,M

6. Cardiac Ion Channelopathies
7. Sarcoidosis
8. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
9. Dilated Cardiomyopathy
10. Ischemic Cardiomyopathy

### Reasoning
1. **Idiopathic Ventricular Tachycardia**: Considering the normal coronary angiography, normal cardiac MRI and absence of structural heart anomalies, this non-structural cause is highly likely.
2. **Brugada Syndrome**: Although the classical ECG changes characteristic of Brugada syndrome are not mentioned explicitly, it remains a conceivable cause of ventricular arrhythmias in structurally normal hearts.
3. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)**: Given the normal cardiac MRI, ARVC is less likely but still a consideration since subtle changes might be missed.
4. **Long QT Syndrome**: Less likely without long QT intervals on ECG; still, a possibility based on arrhythmia susceptibility.
5. **Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)**: This condition is usually triggered by stress or exertion, and given the recurring VT, it merits consideration.
6. **Cardiac Ion Channelopathies**: Considering the absence of structural malformations and the electrical disturbances, various ionic channelopathies could be implicated.
7. **Sarcoidosis**: Less likely due to normal cardiac MRI findings but cannot be completely ruled out without biopsy or advanced imaging.
8. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy**: Very unlikely given the normal-sized chambers and no signs of hypertrophy on MRI.
9. **Dilated Cardiomyopathy**: Very unlikely given normal cardiac MRI results and normal biventricular function.
10. **Ischemic Cardiomyopathy**: Unlikely given normal coronary angiography.","['Cardiology', 'Rhythm Disorders', 'Challenges in Clinical Electrocardiography']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,48.0,F

A 63-year-old man with a history of well-controlled hypertension, lumbar stenosis, and hip arthroplasty with revisions presented with bilateral loss of vision and hearing for several weeks. He also reported a history of painful paresthesias at his feet beginning about 1 year prior. On examination, his visual acuity was initially 20/80 OD and 20/200 OS; it deteriorated over the next 2 months to finger counting bilaterally. The Weber test gave a nonlateralizing result, and bone conduction hearing was absent bilaterally. There was length-dependent loss of vibratory sensation and absent reflexes at both lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated abnormal enhancement of bilateral optic nerves (Figure, A). Optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiogram were normal. Nerve conduction studies showed mild sensory axonal polyneuropathy. Laboratory tests were notable for elevated thyrotropin (63 mlU/ml), low levels of free thyroxine (T4) (0.2 ng/dL), and elevated levels of cerebrospinal fluid protein (94 mg/dL). Cerebrospinal fluid IgG index, oligoclonal bands, aquaporin 4 antibody, paraneoplastic panel, and protein electrophoresis test results were all normal.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Neurosyphilis**: Given the bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, visual impairment, and elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein, neurosyphilis is highly suspected, even though the patient history doesn’t mention syphilis tests, which should be sought in this context.
2. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)**: The presence of demyelinating neuropathy with abnormal optic nerves and sensory polyneuropathy fits CIDP.
3. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: Could explain the multi-system involvement although often accompanied by positive serological tests, which are not documented.
4. **Sarcoidosis**: Can affect the optic nerves and cause neuropathy, often consistent with the MRI findings.
5. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**: Optic neuritis, and other neurologic symptoms are common with MS, though MS typically shows oligoclonal bands in the CSF.
6. **Vitamin B12 Deficiency**: Can cause both sensory neuropathy and optic neuropathy but usually presents with macrocytic anemia, which is not provided in labs.
7. **Susac Syndrome**: Typically involves encephalopathy or branch retinal artery occlusions which are not mentioned; hence moved down.
8. **Wernicke's Encephalopathy**: Needs thiamine deficiency and associated chronic Alcohol use, not clearly supported by available data.
9. **Optic Neuritis**: As a solitary finding, it usually does not explain the hearing loss or sensory neuropathy.
10. **Diabetic Retinopathy and Neuropathy**: Diabetes is not mentioned in history or labs; hence considered lower.

### Re-ranking based on Patient Information and Test Results

1. **Mesenteric Ischemia**: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease, stroke, and her elevated lactate levels, mesenteric ischemia is highly probable.
2. **Acute Appendicitis**: The location of the pain in the right lower quadrant, rebound tenderness, and elevated leukocyte count support this diagnosis.
3. **Diverticulitis**: Considering the right lower quadrant pain and elevated leukocyte count, diverticulitis remains possible, though less likely without evidence of diverticulum on CT.
4. **Ovarian Torsion**: Given her history of polycystic ovarian syndrome and right lower quadrant pain, ovarian torsion is still a conceivable diagnosis.
5. **Kidney Stone**: Less likely given the clinical presentation, but can cause significant abdominal pain.
6. **Pancreatitis**: Despite elevated lipase levels, the location of pain and negative history of alcohol use make this diagnosis less likely.
7. **Acute Gastroenteritis**: Unlikely given the patient's localized pain and significant laboratory findings.
8. **Colorectal Cancer**: Requires further investigation but chronicity and other symptoms are inconsistent with the acute presentation.
9. **Ectopic Pregnancy**: Highly unlikely given the patient's age and improbable based on other clinical findings.
10. **Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm**: Less likely without palpable mass or other indicative signs.

### INPUT:
A postmenopausal woman in her mid-50s (gravida 2, aborta 2) with a known history of endometriosis and adenomyosis presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain that she rated 10 of 10 in intensity and which had developed suddenly 5 days before presentation. The abdominal pain was associated with diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal bloating. On examination, the patient was afebrile and her abdomen was soft and nondistended without guarding or rebound but tender in the left lower quadrant. The patient had a palpable nodule in the posterior vaginal fornix and fullness in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen on bimanual examination. Laboratory investigations had normal findings with the exception of an elevated cancer antigen 125 level of 158 U/mL (to convert to kilounits per liter, multiply by 1.0). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple abnormal findings that included a bulky uterus with a thickened myometrium, endometriomas, right pleural effusion, pelvic peritonitis and ascites, enlarged lymph nodes, and solid extracolonic implants in the omentum caudal to the transverse colon (Figure, A) and in the cul-de-sac adjacent to the upper rectum (Figure, B). Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed 2 areas of focus corresponding with the extracolonic implants. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Perforation by foreign bodies,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis
1. **Ovarian Cancer:** Given the elevated CA-125 level, postmenopausal status, and CT findings of ascites, pleural effusion, and solid extracolonic implants.
2. **Endometriosis:** Known history of endometriosis, endometriomas on imaging, and chronic pelvic pain.
3. **Adenomyosis:** Known history of adenomyosis and imaging findings of a bulky uterus with thickened myometrium.
4. **Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID):** Pelvic peritonitis and tender left lower quadrant on examination.
5. **Diverticulitis:** Left lower quadrant pain and CT finding of fullness in the lower abdomen.
6. **Gastrointestinal Malignancy:** Such as colorectal cancer, given the presence of solid extracolonic implants near the rectum.
7. **Pelvic Abscess:** Severe abdominal pain and imaging findings of abnormalities.
8. **Peritoneal Carcinomatosis:** Ascites, solid implants, and pleural effusion often associated with metastatic abdominal cancers.
9. **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS):** Abdominal pain associated with diarrhea and bloating.
10. **Uterine Sarcoma:** Bulky uterus and thickened myometrium on imaging, along with elevated CA-125 level.

### Final Ranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results
1. **Ovarian Cancer:** Elevated CA-125, pleural effusion, ascites, and solid extracolonic implants strongly suggest malignancy.
2. **Peritoneal Carcinomatosis:** Given the imaging findings of multiple solid implants and ascites, often secondary to ovarian or gastrointestinal malignancies.
3. **Gastrointestinal Malignancy:** Solid extracolonic implants in the omentum and near the rectum could indicate metastatic colorectal cancer.
4. **Endometriosis:** Known history and consistent imaging findings, but less likely given the elevated CA-125 and severity of current symptoms.
5. **Adenomyosis:** Bulky uterus with thickened myometrium; however, other findings and severity of symptoms make this less likely as a primary cause.
6. **Diverticulitis:** Localized left lower quadrant pain, could be a contributing factor though other findings are more concerning.
7. **Pelvic Abscess:** Severe pain and collective abnormal imaging findings, though less supported by laboratory and clinical findings.
8. **Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID):** Less likely given the patient's postmenopausal status and lack of fever but cannot be completely ruled out.
9. **Uterine Sarcoma:** Imaging abnormalities in uterus, persistent elevated CA-125 may suggest a rare uterine malignancy.
10. **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS):** Symptoms of diarrhea and bloating but not fitting the acute severity and imaging findings.","['Surgery', 'Gastrointestinal Surgery']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,55.0,F

### INPUT:
A woman in her early 50s with hypothyroidism and a 10-month history of painless lumps in her neck presented with achiness and decreased visual acuity in her right eye for 2 months. Associated symptoms included dysphagia and fever and chills. A previous otolaryngology evaluation revealed an intranasal mass with enlargement of multiple submandibular lymph nodes. A needle aspiration biopsy of 1 of the submandibular lymph nodes revealed atypical cells with mature lymphocytes. Computed tomography of the sinus confirmed a nasal polyp and a soft tissue mass in the right lacrimal gland region. The excised nasal polyp was benign. Incisional biopsy of the lacrimal gland lesion revealed chronic inflammatory infiltrate composed of predominantly T cells with scattered B cells and mature plasma cells, but no evidence of a lymphoproliferative process. The patient was referred for evaluation in our clinic. Ocular history was noncontributory. On examination, visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure was unremarkable and ocular motility was intact in both eyes. Clinical evaluation revealed a firm mass of 5 × 4 × 3 cm fixed to the superotemporal orbital rim in the right lacrimal gland region (Figure 1) with intact overlying skin. Slitlamp examination was unremarkable in both eyes without evidence of conjunctival inflammatory signs. Ophthalmoscopic examination was unremarkable in both eyes without compression of the optic nerve or disc edema. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Rosai-Dorfman disease,"Sure, let's build a differential diagnosis step by step.

### 10-Step Differential Diagnosis

1. **Lymphoma** - Considered due to the presence of atypical lymphocytes and submandibular lymphadenopathy.
2. **IgG4-related disease** - Chronic inflammation in multiple regions including the lacrimal gland, characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration.
3. **Hodgkin’s lymphoma** - Includes painless lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms such as fever and chills.
4. **Sjogren’s syndrome** - Can present with chronic inflammation in the lacrimal gland, and related lymphadenopathy.
5. **Sarcoidosis** - May cause granulomatous inflammation that can affect the lacrimal gland and lymph nodes.
6. **Thyroid eye disease** - Especially considering her history of hypothyroidism, though ocular signs are less supportive.
7. **Chronic sinusitis with orbital involvement** - Could present with a nasal polyp and lacrimal gland mass.
8. **Nasopharyngeal carcinoma** - Can present with a nasal mass, lymphadenopathy, and orbital involvement.
9. **Wegener's granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis)** - Can present with granulomatous inflammation affecting sinus and orbit.
10. **Reactive lymphadenopathy** - Reactive process due to chronic infection or inflammation.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis using All Patient Information

Based on the detailed patient information and test results, the differential diagnosis can be reranked as:

1. **IgG4-related disease** - Chronic inflammation with lymphoplasmacytic infiltration fits well, despite the absence of a definitive lymphoproliferative process.
2. **Sarcoidosis** - Granulomatous inflammation that can affect lacrimal gland and have systemic symptoms fits.
3. **Hodgkin’s lymphoma** - Fits the systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy, though biopsy findings are less supportive.
4. **Lymphoma** - Initial consideration due to atypical lymphocytes, but less likely given biopsy results.
5. **Sjogren’s syndrome** - Involves chronic inflammation of the lacrimal gland with systemic autoimmune manifestations.
6. **Thyroid eye disease** - History of hypothyroidism with possible orbital involvement, still plausible.
7. **Chronic sinusitis with orbital involvement** - Nasal polyp and mass could be related to chronic sinus condition.
8. **Nasopharyngeal carcinoma** - Though less likely without definitive malignant findings in biopsy.
9. **Wegener's granulomatosis** - Granulomatous inflammation in sinus and orbit, though less likely without more specific findings.
10. **Reactive lymphadenopathy** - Least likely given chronic nature and systemic manifestations.

### INPUT:
A white man in his early 50s presented to the emergency department of Massachusetts Eye and Ear with a 1-day history of sudden decreased visual acuity in the right eye. He denied any recent trauma, flashes, floaters, pain, or any prior similar episodes. His medical history was remarkable for asthma and prostate cancer, and review of systems was negative except for his visual loss. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/400 OD and 20/20 OS. Pupils were reactive with no relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressure measurements were unremarkable, as were results of the external and slitlamp examinations. Dilated fundus examination of the right eye showed submacular hemorrhage with pigment epithelial detachment (Figure 1A). Results of a dilated fundus examination of the left eye were unremarkable. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the right eye (Figure 1B) revealed subretinal and sub–retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) hemorrhage; results were unremarkable in the left eye. 
### OUTPUT:

**Step 9:**
9. Choroidal Neovascularization

**Step 10:**
10. Trauma (even though he denied recent trauma)

### Reranking Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**:
   - The presence of submacular hemorrhage with pigment epithelial detachment and the patient's age strongly suggests AMD, particularly the exudative type.

2. **Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO)**:
   - Could present with sudden visual loss and hemorrhage; however, typically has additional signs such as retinal hemorrhages and cotton-wool spots.

3. **Choroidal Neovascularization**:
   - Significant overlap with AMD, often secondary to AMD but can occur without.

4. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR)**:
   - Usually affects younger patients and does not commonly present with hemorrhage, but subretinal fluid might initially be considered.

5. **Ocular Ischemic Syndrome**:
   - Typically more extensive hemorrhages and other ischemic signs, but still plausible given sudden visual loss.

6. **Retinal Detachment**:
   - Would present more often with flashes/floaters and a curtain-like visual defect, less likely here.

7. **Macular Hole**:
   - Presents with sudden central vision loss, but less likely without specific OCT findings and absence of submacular hemorrhage.

8. **Diabetic Retinopathy**:
   - Unlikely without a history of diabetes and specific retinal signs such as microaneurysms, exudates, or neovascularization.

9. **Toxoplasmosis Chorioretinitis**:
   - Typically presents with focal necrotic retinal lesions and not the same hemorrhage pattern.

10. **Trauma**:
   - Less likely given denial of recent trauma, no traumatic signs upon examination.

### INPUT:
On day 15 of induction therapy with intravenous cytarabine, vincristine sulfate, dexamethasone, pegaspargase, and intrathecal methotrexate, a 3-year-old girl with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia presented to the oncology department with an asymptomatic skin lesion. No known skin trauma occurred. The patient was afebrile, and vital signs were stable. On examination, a 4.0 × 2.0-cm, oval-shaped violaceous to black plaque with a central hemorrhagic bulla and surrounding hyperemia was noted on the left lower back (Figure 1). A complete blood cell count revealed a white blood cell count of 1800/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), with 2% neutrophils (absolute neutrophil count, 36/μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]), hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10), and platelet count of 10 × 103/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 1). Her blood glucose level was 326 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). The patient was administered broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically, and a dermatologist was consulted. Two punch biopsy specimens from the lower back plaque were obtained and sent for histologic analysis and tissue culture (bacteria, atypical mycobacteria, and fungus). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Mucormycosis,"### Step-by-step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Ecthyma Gangrenosum** - A skin infection typically caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, often seen in immunocompromised patients.
2. **Leukemia Cutis** - A manifestation of leukemia presenting as skin infiltration by malignant cells.
3. **Fungal Infection (e.g., Aspergillosis, Candida)** - Common in immunocompromised patients and can present with similar plaques.
4. **Herpes Simplex Virus Infection** - Can cause skin lesions in immunocompromised individuals.
5. **Disseminated Zoster** - Caused by Varicella-Zoster Virus, leading to widespread vesicular rash.
6. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum** - A rare skin condition that causes large, painful sores.
7. **Cutaneous Anthrax** - Caused by Bacillus anthracis, characterized by black eschar.
8. **Loxoscelism (Brown Recluse Spider Bite)** - Can present with necrotic skin lesions.
9. **Vasculitis** - Various types can cause skin lesions, especially in the context of severe neutropenia.
10. **Sweet's Syndrome (Acute Febrile Neutrophilic Dermatosis)** - Characterized by fever, elevated neutrophil count (not always), and painful skin lesions.

### Reevaluating Based on Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Ecthyma Gangrenosum** - Most consistent with the described lesion and the patient's immunocompromised state.
2. **Leukemia Cutis** - Plausible given the underlying leukemia, but slightly less likely due to the specific lesion characteristics.
3. **Fungal Infection** - Important consideration due to immunosuppression, awaiting culture results.
4. **Vasculitis** - The specific lesion characteristics and severe neutropenia warrant this consideration.
5. **Sweet's Syndrome** - Less likely due to the lack of fever and neutrophil count details.
6. **Herpes Simplex Virus Infection** - Possible but less favored due to lesion appearance and absence of pain.
7. **Disseminated Zoster** - Unlikely due to the specific lesion description and afebrile state.
8. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum** - Less likely due to the clinical appearance of the lesion.
9. **Loxoscelism** - Uncommon but still a differential; more history of exposure would be needed.
10. **Cutaneous Anthrax** - Unlikely without endemic exposure or additional history to suggest it.

### Conclusion:

Based on the reevaluation with all patient information and current test results, the most likely diagnosis is **Ecthyma Gangrenosum**, particularly given the patient's immunocompromised state and the characteristic appearance of the lesion.","['Dermatology', 'Hematology', 'Oncology', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Leukemias']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.0,F

### INPUT:
A woman in her 80s presented to hospital with somnolence and fatigue of 2 days’ duration. Medical history included lower urinary tract symptoms of 1-week duration for which she was prescribed cotrimoxazole with no improvement. She also reported progressively worsening vulvar and buttock pain of 5 days’ duration. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit 3 weeks prior to presentation for pneumonia and remained hospitalized for 10 days. She was not sexually active and had no medical history of sexually transmitted infections. Anogenital examination revealed vulvar (Figure 1A) and buttock ulcers (Figure 1B) tender to palpation. Initial blood workup showed leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 2400 cells/μL (to convert to cells/L, multiply by 106), a differential of 72% neutrophils, and a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL with a hematocrit differential of 27% (to convert hemoglobin to g/L, multiply by 10.0).

### OUTPUT:
    ",Cytomegalovirus ulcers,"Given the patient's presentation and workup, we need to consider a broad differential diagnosis. Let's proceed step by step.

### Step-by-step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection** 
   - The vulvar and buttock ulcers and somnolence suggest a possible viral infection.

2. **Necrotizing Fasciitis**
   - Given the acute and severe nature of the pain and the ulcers, a possible severe bacterial infection should be considered.

3. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**
   - Vulvar and buttock ulcers can be a manifestation of this inflammatory disorder.

4. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)**
   - The presentation of mucocutaneous lesions and a recent medication could suggest drug-induced SJS.

5. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection**
   - Immunocompromised state (recent hospitalization, pneumonia) makes CMV a possible cause, especially with ulcerative lesions.

6. **Vulvar Cancer**
   - Malignancy must be considered due to ulcers' chronicity and non-responsiveness to initial treatment.

7. **Behçet's Disease**
   - This autoimmune condition can cause recurrent oral and genital ulcers and systemic symptoms.

8. **Syphilis**
   - Though she has no history of STIs and is not sexually active, tertiary syphilis can present atypically in older patients.

9. **Crohn's Disease**
   - Can present with extraintestinal manifestations like perianal ulcers and general symptoms of malaise.

10. **Leukemia**
    - The leukopenia, anemia, and nonspecific symptoms (fatigue, ulcers) could suggest a hematologic malignancy.

### Reranked Diagnosis Considering All Information:

1. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection**
   - Ulcerative lesions in the genital area and somnolence are strongly suggestive, especially if immunocompromised.

2. **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection**
   - Immunocompromised status and nature of the lesions necessitate consideration of CMV infection.

3. **Necrotizing Fasciitis**
   - Severe pain and ulcers are consistent with this severe diagnosis; however, laboratory findings are less suggestive of a systemic bacterial infection at this point.

4. **Leukemia**
   - Given the anemia, leukopenia, and severe general symptoms, this warrants high consideration.

5. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum**
   - The progressive ulcers can align with this diagnosis, especially given the prior hospitalization.

6. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)**
   - Less likely without mucous membrane involvement or systemic signs of severe drug reaction.

7. **Behçet's Disease**
   - Recurrent ulcers and systemic symptoms fit, but the patient's age and lack of prior history make it less likely.

8. **Vulvar Cancer**
   - Considered due to chronicity but lower due to acute presentation and recent hospitalization not typically aligning with cancer presenting so acutely.

9. **Syphilis**
   - Still a differential but less likely due to recent medical history and absence of other classic signs.

10. **Crohn's Disease**
    - Least likely due to lack of gastrointestinal symptoms and the acute nature of the current presentation.

To reach a conclusive diagnosis, further investigations such as viral cultures, PCR tests for HSV and CMV, blood cultures, and possibly imaging studies or additional biopsies might be warranted.","['Dermatology', 'Geriatrics', 'Urology', 'Gynecology', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,80.0,F

### INPUT:
A pregnant woman in her late 30s had normal findings on anatomic ultrasonography at 19 weeks’ gestation. Follow-up ultrasonography at 32 weeks’ gestation identified fetal hydrops. The fetal ultrasonogram showed a large left-sided hydrothorax, mediastinal shift, and ascites. After ruling out infectious causes, an ultrasonography-guided thoracoamniotic shunt was placed successfully at 32 weeks’ gestation. Results of follow-up ultrasonography on postoperative day 3 showed improvement in the fetal hydrothorax and resolution of hydrops and identified a feeding vessel originating from the descending aorta supplying a lung mass (Figure 1A). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Bronchopulmonary sequestration,"**Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation (CCAM)**
   - Specific finding: Feeding vessel originating from the descending aorta supplying a lung mass.

2. **Pulmonary Sequestration**
   - Specific finding: Non-functioning lung tissue with abnormal systemic arterial supply.

3. **Bronchopulmonary Foregut Malformation (BPFM)**
   - Specific finding: Rare congenital malformation, combining anomalies of the respiratory and digestive systems.

4. **Lymphatic Malformation**
   - Specific finding: Lymph-filled cystic masses, can cause hydrops through lymphatic obstruction.

5. **Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH)**
   - Specific finding: A defect in the diaphragm allowing abdominal organs to move into the chest cavity.

6. **Congenital High Airway Obstruction Syndrome (CHAOS)**
   - Specific finding: Severe airway obstruction visible on prenatal imaging.

7. **Chylothorax**
   - Specific finding: Accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the pleural cavity, visualized as pleural effusion on ultrasound.

8. **Thoracic Teratoma**
   - Specific finding: A type of germ cell tumor, often contains several types of tissues.

9. **Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation (CPAM)**
   - Specific finding: Multicystic mass of lung tissue with various degrees of differentiation.

10. **Eventration of the Diaphragm**
    - Specific finding: Abnormal elevation of the diaphragm due to muscular deficiency but not a true hernia.

**Reranked Final List of Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation (CCAM)**
   - The presence of lung mass and feeding vessel originating from the descending aorta is highly suggestive of Type III CCAM.

2. **Pulmonary Sequestration**
   - Second most likely due to the systemic arterial supply; although the improvement after shunt placement suggests involvement of fluid dynamics compatible with CCAM.

3. **Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation (CPAM)**
   - Though ranked third, this can sometimes confuse with CCAM due to overlapping features.

4. **Lymphatic Malformation**
   - Considered due to its association with fetal hydrops, though less likely given the specific vascular features identified.

5. **Bronchopulmonary Foregut Malformation (BPFM)**
   - Rare but should be considered; might appear similar on imaging but typically involves esophageal connection.

6. **Chylothorax**
   - Considered because it can cause hydrothorax, but less likely with a clear systemic feeding vessel identified.

7. **Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH)**
   - Mediastinal shift could suggest CDH; however, lack of visible herniation of abdominal organs on imaging reduces likelihood.

8. **Congenital High Airway Obstruction Syndrome (CHAOS)**
   - Severe airway obstruction would likely present differently and earlier in gestation.

9. **Thoracic Teratoma**
   - Rare germ cell tumor would have more diverse tissue components, unlike the lung mass described.

10. **Eventration of the Diaphragm**
    - Least likely due to a lack of diaphragmatic elevation description and lower correlation with the observed systemic vascular feature.

### INPUT:
An adolescent girl presented with a 3-month history of a growing, painless mass in the right thigh. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed an inhomogeneous nodule in the subcutaneous layer with a largest diameter of approximately 5 cm. No enlarged lymph nodes were detectable in the groin. Results of a complete blood cell count and levels of alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein were unremarkable. An ultrasonography-guided core needle biopsy was performed, and histopathologic evaluation showed the aspects of a small round-cell tumor, which was confirmed to be a Ewing sarcoma by immunohistochemical and molecular analysis (with positivity for the EWS-FLI1 fusion gene [OMIM 133450]). The patient then underwent disease staging with computed tomography (CT) of the chest and whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). The CT findings were negative for secondary lesions; the FDG-PET scan demonstrated, as expected, high uptake in the right thigh (maximum standard uptake variable [SUVmax], 8.4) at the site of the subcutaneous tumor and at a second lesion in the left ankle joint (SUVmax, 12.0). The patient reported vague pain around the left ankle but no functional limitations and no history of trauma at that site. A radiograph of the ankle did not show calcifications within the soft-tissue lesion. An MRI scan of the ankle showed a 1.5-cm soft tissue mass in the posterior recess of the ankle joint with a low to intermediate signal in T1- and T2-weighted sequences and moderate contrast enhancement throughout the lesion (Figure 1). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Tenosynovial giant cell tumor,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Ewing Sarcoma** - Confirmed by histopathologic evaluation, immunohistochemical analysis, and molecular analysis (EWS-FLI1 fusion gene positivity).

2. **Osteosarcoma** - Secondary consideration given the patient's age and presentation of a growing mass in the thigh, though typically presents with a primary bone lesion.

3. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - Given the presentation of a soft tissue mass and the patient's age group, especially considering embryonal or alveolar subtypes.

4. **Lymphoma** - Considering the small round-cell appearance on histopathology and painless mass presentation, although usually associated with lymphadenopathy.

5. **Synovial Sarcoma** - A high-yield differential due to its presentation as a soft tissue mass near the joints, particularly occurring in adolescents and young adults.

6. **Neuroblastoma** - Less common for presenting in the extremities but still a possible consideration for soft tissue masses in young patients.

7. **Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor (PNET)** - Another differential in the family of small round-cell tumors, similar to Ewing sarcoma but requiring differentiation via molecular analysis.

8. **Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor (DSRCT)** - Given the biopsy showing small round-cell tumor characteristics, typically seen in adolescents/young adults.

9. **Liposarcoma** - Uncommon for the age but consideration given for atypical presentations, particularly for soft tissue masses.

10. **Nodular Fasciitis** - Although benign, differential consideration for a rapidly growing soft tissue mass, though less expected to show small round-cell characteristics on biopsy.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:
After considering all patient information, imaging, biopsy results, and molecular analysis:

1. **Ewing Sarcoma** - Definitively diagnosed via histopathology, immunohistochemical, and molecular confirmation.
2. **Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor (PNET)** - Almost identical molecular characteristics requires differentiation from Ewing sarcoma.
3. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - Considered due to patient age and mass characteristics but biopsy results supported Ewing sarcoma.
4. **Osteosarcoma** - A strong differential for an adolescent with a mass, but less likely given imaging and biopsy results.
5. **Synovial Sarcoma** - Also a high-yield differential near joints; however, imaging/biopsy favored Ewing sarcoma.
6. **Lymphoma** - Less likely given no lymphadenopathy and specific histopathologic findings.
7. **Neuroblastoma** - Unlikely due to typical origin in the adrenal gland or sympathetic chain.
8. **Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor (DSRCT)** - Less probable given biopsy confirmation of Ewing sarcoma.
9. **Liposarcoma** - Unlikely given patient age and histopathologic findings.

### INPUT:
A 63-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation, who was receiving warfarin and had a history of atrial septal defect (ASD) and ventricular septal defect (VSD) repair in her 20s, presented with stupor and new facial droop. A computed tomographic examination of the brain showed a right frontal lobe abscess with vasogenic edema (Figure 1). She underwent burrhole aspiration of the abscess, which grew mixed oral flora. Treatment involved a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics, steroids, and medications for seizure prophylaxis. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Persistent left superior vena cava,"## Differential Diagnosis - Step by Step

### Step 1: Stroke
Given her atrial fibrillation and presentation with stupor and new facial droop, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke is highly possible.

### Step 2: Brain Abscess
Considering the computed tomographic examination of the brain showed a right frontal lobe abscess.

### Step 3: Brain Tumor
A brain neoplasm could present with new neurological deficits and imaging findings.

### Step 4: Encephalitis
Brain infection such as encephalitis can also present with stupor and focal neurological deficits.

### Step 5: Subdural Hematoma
A history of anticoagulant usage like warfarin can predispose to subdural hematomas, which can present similarly.

### Step 6: Cerebral Metastasis
Given her age, the possibility of metastasis from another primary malignancy should be considered.

### Step 7: Brain Aneurysm
A ruptured brain aneurysm could explain acute neurological changes especially with her history of anticoagulant use.

### Step 8: Septic Embolus
Her atrial fibrillation and history of congenital heart defect repair increase the risk of septic emboli leading to brain abscess formation.

### Step 9: Meningitis
An infectious etiology like meningitis could present with altered mental status.

### Step 10: Electrolyte Imbalance
Severe electrolyte imbalances could cause stupor and mimic other central nervous system issues.

## Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Brain Abscess**
   - Supported by imaging findings and positive culture of mixed oral flora.

2. **Stroke**
   - High risk due to atrial fibrillation but imaging did not primarily show stroke.

3. **Septic Embolus**
   - Creating a brain abscess fits with her heart history and mixed oral flora.

4. **Encephalitis**
   - Less likely due to clear pinpointed abscess on imaging.

5. **Subdural Hematoma**
   - Anticoagulant use places this at higher risk but imaging supports abscess.

6. **Brain Tumor**
   - Lacks specific radiologic characteristics suggestive of tumor.

7. **Cerebral Metastasis**
   - Less likely given the patient's clinical growth pattern on mixed flora.

8. **Brain Aneurysm**
   - Rupture typically results in subarachnoid hemorrhage, not featured here.

9. **Meningitis**
   - CSF examination would aid in differentiation; no direct radiologic support.

10. **Electrolyte Imbalance**
   - Possible, but does not explain localized brain abscess on imaging.

### INPUT:
A healthy 8-month-old male infant was admitted for management of a rapidly progressive, painful anogenital ulcer. The lesion had developed acutely over 48 hours, starting as symmetric pink patches leading to pustules, erosions, and ulceration. Associated symptoms included generalized fatigue, but no fevers, chills, or other systemic symptoms. The child’s parents denied any new topical exposures or medications. The child was born via vaginal delivery at full term. Pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The child had no major medical issues and met all developmental milestones. There was no relevant family medical history. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics were initiated on admission. Dermatology was consulted prior to scheduled debridement and skin grafting. Physical examination revealed a well-appearing infant with normal vital signs. Extending from the gluteal cleft to just medial to the scrotum, there was a symmetric, well-defined ulcer with a cribriform base, central necrosis, and rolled, pink-to-violaceous, undermined border (Figure, A). Initial laboratory workup was significant for leukocytosis (22 000/mm3) and thrombocytosis (764 000/mm3). Serum zinc and alkaline phosphatase were within normal limits. A punch biopsy of the edge of the ulcer was obtained and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (Figure, B and C). Microbial stains were negative. Tissue cultures for anaerobic and/or aerobic, mycobacterial, and fungal organisms were all negative, though wound cultures grew Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Enterococcus faecalis. Viral cultures were negative. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Pyoderma gangrenosum,"Given the presented case, we'll establish a differential diagnosis step-by-step, considering the information available and refining the list with each step.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum:** Given the rapid progression of the ulcer, the painful nature, and the presence of a rolled, undermined border.
2. **Infectious Eczematous Dermatitis (Superinfected):** Considering the E. coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Enterococcus faecalis isolated from wound cultures, even though primary infections like this are less common in infants.
3. **Behçet’s Disease:** Rare in infants but should be considered due to painful ulcers and lack of response to initial antibiotic therapy.
4. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis:** Rare but possible in infants presenting with ulcerative skin lesions.
5. **Chronic Granulomatous Disease:** Considering recurrent bacterial infections, especially unusual bacteria.
6. **Congenital Syphilis:** Ulcerative lesions can be a presenting feature despite the absence of maternal history.
7. **Leukemia Cutis:** Given the leukocytosis, though very uncommon at this age.
8. **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Cutaneous Manifestations):** Infants might rarely present with ulcerative skin lesions.
9. **Nutritional Deficiency (e.g., Zinc):** Acrodermatitis enteropathica should be reconsidered despite normal zinc levels.
10. **Autoimmune Vasculitis:** Such as Kawasaki disease with atypical presentation.

### Re-ranking Based on All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Pyoderma Gangrenosum:** Strongly fitting the ulcer characteristics and rapid progression.
2. **Chronic Granulomatous Disease:** Due to recurring infections and immune deficiency considerations.
3. **Behçet’s Disease:** Ulcerative, painful lesions warrant its inclusion despite rarity.
4. **Leukemia Cutis:** Due to significant leukocytosis.
5. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis:** Due to presentation with erosive skin lesions.
6. **Congenital Syphilis:** Needs reconsideration given ulcer presentation despite maternal history.
7. **Autoimmune Vasculitis:** Given systemic nature and presentation.
8. **Nutritional Deficiency (e.g., Zinc):** Remains a potential consideration for skin lesions.
9. **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Cutaneous Manifestations):** Due to ulcer presentation and erosive lesions.
10. **Infectious Eczematous Dermatitis (Superinfected):** Less likely primary, but due to secondary infection presence.

In summary, Pyoderma Gangrenosum should be the primary working diagnosis given the distinctive lesion characteristics and rapid progression. Further specialized dermatological evaluation and possible immunological testing would solidify the diagnosis.","['Pediatrics', 'Pain Medicine', 'Dermatology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0.67,M

### INPUT:
An 8-year-old boy presented to the pediatric emergency department with 2 weeks of fatigue and 3 days of double vision, ptosis, and painless periorbital swelling of the left eye. Medical history was unremarkable with no recent weight loss, travel, or trauma. Visual acuity without correction was 20/20 OU. The right pupil was 3.5 mm and briskly reactive, while the left pupil was 8.5 mm and unreactive to light or near effort; there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. Results of testing with the use of an Amsler grid and Ishihara color plates were within normal limits. Visual fields were full to confrontation. The optic nerves and retina were normal in both eyes. External examination was notable for left periorbital swelling, proptosis, and moderate ptosis of the upper eyelid (Figure 1A). Extraocular motility examination results were normal in the right eye but demonstrated severe ophthalmoparesis of the left eye: 0% supraduction (Figure 1B), 20% of normal abduction/adduction, and 10% of normal infraduction (not pictured). Corneal reflex was normal in the right eye but diminished in the left eye, and facial strength was normal bilaterally. The remainder of the neurologic examination results were normal. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cavernous sinus syndrome,"### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis Process:

1. **Myasthenia Gravis** - Given the presentation of ptosis and ophthalmoparesis with a normal neurologic exam, an autoimmune disorder affecting neuromuscular junctions could be considered.
 
2. **Orbital Cellulitis** - The periorbital swelling and proptosis suggest a potential infectious process around the eye socket.
 
3. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - Although rare in children, proptosis and ophthalmoparesis can be related to underlying thyroid issues.
 
4. **Cranial Nerve III Palsy (Oculomotor Nerve Palsy)** - Severe ophthalmoparesis, ptosis, and a reactive pupil on the affected side aligns with potential cranial nerve issues.
 
5. **Intracranial Mass (e.g., Optic Glioma)** - The presence of localized symptoms such as ptosis and ophthalmoparesis may suggest a mass effect.
 
6. **Cavernous Sinus Syndrome** - Swelling and severe ophthalmoparesis with associated cranial nerve palsies could point towards cavernous sinus pathology.
 
7. **Pediatric Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation** - Non-infectious inflammation affecting the orbit can explain periorbital swelling and ophthalmoparesis.
 
8. **Leukemia or Lymphoma** - Systemic malignancies can present with focal neurological deficits and ophthalmic signs.
 
9. **Trauma** - Despite no history of trauma, occult trauma or abuse should be ruled out.
 
10. **Botulism** - Neuromuscular disorder in children leading to progressive weakness and ophthalmic symptoms.

### Reranked Diagnoses:

1. **Cranial Nerve III Palsy (Oculomotor Nerve Palsy)** - The unilateral ptosis, severe ophthalmoparesis, and large unreactive pupil strongly indicate cranial nerve involvement.
2. **Orbital Cellulitis** - Given the acute onset of periorbital swelling and proptosis, an infectious etiology remains high on the differential.
3. **Cavernous Sinus Syndrome** - This encompasses multiple cranial nerves and vascular components, explaining the severe ophthalmoparesis and ptosis.
4. **Intracranial Mass (e.g., Optic Glioma)** - Considering an intracranial process due to the localized nature and severity of symptoms.
5. **Myasthenia Gravis** - The age and symptom distribution support this, though less likely without fluctuating symptoms and absence of fatigability.
6. **Thyroid Eye Disease** - While rare in this age group, cannot be completely excluded due to the nature of symptoms.
7. **Leukemia or Lymphoma** - Given systemic presentation possibilities, malignancies should be considered, although blood work and other systemic evaluations would be needed.
8. **Pediatric Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation** - Non-infectious inflammatory processes without mass effect should be considered.
9. **Botulism** - Neuromuscular involvement makes this a consideration, though less likely due to isolated ocular involvement.
10. **Trauma** - Least likely given no history or signs of trauma, but considered in a thorough evaluation.

### INPUT:
A girl in her midteens presented to an ophthalmology practice with her parents reporting worsening blurry vision on the right side for the past 2 weeks. She had a history of migraine headaches, for which she took nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for symptomatic relief. At her examination, she reported feeling tired but denied other medical problems. On examination, her visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Intraocular pressure was 15 mm Hg OU, extraocular motility was normal, and findings of the anterior segment examination were normal. There was no afferent pupillary defect, and dilated fundus examination revealed healthy-appearing optic nerves and normal retinas. Automated perimetry demonstrated a right-sided homonymous hemianopia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain performed the same day revealed subacute infarction of portions of the left occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes (Figure). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Moyamoya disease,"### Initial Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Migraine with aura** 
   - Given her history of migraines, it's reasonable to suspect that her symptoms might be related to a complicated migraine with aura.

2. **Occipital lobe infarction**
   - MRI results confirming subacute infarction of the left occipital lobe provide strong evidence for this diagnosis.

3. **Brain tumor**
   - A slow-growing tumor in the occipital lobe could potentially cause these symptoms and would be visible on imaging.

4. **Multiple sclerosis**
   - MS can present with migraines and can cause visual and other neurological deficits through demyelination.

5. **Transient ischemic attack (TIA)**
   - Though the symptoms are often temporary, a TIA could potentially resolve before imaging if the clinical history suggests brief neurological changes.

6. **Arteriovenous malformation (AVM)**
   - An AVM in the brain could cause localized infarction and neurological symptoms with the risk of bleeding.

7. **Moyamoya disease**
   - This condition causes progressive narrowing of cerebral arteries and can lead to strokes, especially in younger individuals.

8. **Vasculitis**
   - CNS vasculitis could cause inflammatory changes leading to infarctions in the brain, presenting with various neurological symptoms.

9. **Fabry disease**
   - This is a metabolic disorder that can rarely present with stroke-like episodes, even in young individuals.

10. **Coagulopathy**
    - An abnormality in the patient's blood clotting mechanism could lead to an increased risk of strokes and might not always be detected on routine examination.

### Re-ranked Differential Diagnoses Based on MRI Results and Other Patient Information:

1. **Occipital lobe infarction**
   - The MRI evidence showing subacute infarction in the left occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes directly corresponds with her presenting symptoms.

2. **Brain tumor**
   - Though less likely given the acute nature of her presentation and MRI findings, a growing tumor might still be a consideration.

3. **Moyamoya disease**
   - This condition should be considered in young stroke patients, as it can cause recurrent infarctions.

4. **Vasculitis**
   - CNS vasculitis could explain the infarction if inflammatory processes led to vessel occlusion.

5. **Multiple sclerosis**
   - Despite typical white matter involvement in MS, cortical demyelination can still present with MRI findings similar to those seen here.

6. **Arteriovenous malformation (AVM)**
   - An AVM may cause localized infarction but would typically be detected on the MRI with clear vascular abnormalities.

7. **Fabry disease**
   - Rare but possible; metabolic and rare genetic disorders should not be completely dismissed, especially in atypical presentations.

8. **Migraine with aura**
   - Unlikely given the MRI findings, but the patient's history necessitates consideration for complicated migraine.

9. **Coagulopathy**
   - Risk of stroke due to underlying hematologic conditions remains a differential until coagulopathy is ruled out by appropriate tests.

10. **Transient ischemic attack (TIA)**
    - This is generally lower on the list given the longer duration of symptoms and persistent deficits corresponding with imaging findings.

### INPUT:
A woman in her early 50s was referred for decreased vision. Symptom onset was approximately 3 months prior to presentation when the patient began reporting difficulty reading. She was initially evaluated by her local eye care professional and noted to have visual acuity of 20/100 OD and 20/25 OS with cecocentral visual field defect in the right eye. Results of ophthalmoscopic examination of the optic nerves at this time revealed mild elevation of the optic nerves. Magnetic resonance imaging findings of the orbits were normal. At presentation 3 months after onset of decreased vision, the patient reported that her vision continued to worsen. Best corrected visual acuity was measured at 20/400 OD and 20/40 OS. Both optic nerves were found to be mildly hyperemic with a few telangiectatic vessels on the left and trace temporal pallor on the right. Color vision was 3/13 in the right eye and normal in the left. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. The patient’s 24-2 Humphrey visual field in the right eye is shown in the Figure. The left eye had a very similar pattern.

9. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**
10. **Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG)**

### Re-ranked Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)**: The bilateral, progressive nature of vision loss along with cecocentral scotomas and normal MRI of the orbits strongly suggests this diagnosis, particularly given the patient's age and continued deterioration.
2. **Optic Neuritis**: Bilateral optic nerve involvement and hyperemia could indicate this, but typically would present with pain and more commonly affect younger individuals or those with MS.
3. **Toxic/Nutritional Optic Neuropathy**: Progressive bilateral visual loss with similar visual field defects can be due to exposure to toxins or nutritional deficiencies.
4. **Chronic Papilledema**: Mildly elevated optic nerves observed but would likely have other signs or symptoms, including headaches or increased intracranial pressure, which are not mentioned.
5. **Autoimmune Optic Neuropathy**: Could cause similar findings but less likely without other systemic autoimmune indicators.
6. **Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION)**: Usually sudden onset and more common in older patients, with clear risk factors like blood pressure or diabetes history.
7. **Mitochondrial Optic Neuropathy**: Similar presentation to LHON, but distinct from other mitochondrial diseases that may affect the patient systemically.
8. **Compressive Optic Neuropathy**: Normal MRI makes this less likely.
9. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**: Although MS can cause optic neuritis, it generally has other neurological symptoms and pain with eye movement.

A 44-year-old African American woman without traditional atherosclerotic risk factors or known coronary artery disease (CAD) presented to the emergency department with chest pain. She had 3 previous pregnancies (2 live births and 1 spontaneous abortion); her last child was born more than 5 years ago. Her chest pain began spontaneously 1 hour prior to presentation and was described as retrosternal with radiation to her upper and middle back. On physical examination, her blood pressure was 128/88 mm Hg, her pulse was regular at 96 beats per minute, her respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, and her temperature was 36.9° C. Pulse oximetry was 100% in room air. The chest was nontender. Pertinent physical findings included normal central venous pressures, clear lung fields, normal first and second heart sounds, an audible fourth heart sound, and no murmurs. The electrocardiogram (Figure 1A) demonstrated anterior ST-segment elevations consistent with an anterior acute current of injury. Results from the chest radiography were normal. Initial troponin I concentration was 0.02 ng/mL but rose to 177.76 ng/mL over the ensuing 4 hours (the patient’s chest pain had resolved by this time). Urgent coronary angiography was performed (Figure 1B). Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grade 2 was observed in the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch.

### Reranking Based on Patient Information and Test Results
1. **Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)**
   - Evidence: Anterior ST-segment elevations on ECG, significant rise in troponin levels, TIMI 2 flow observed in angiography.
2. **Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD)**
   - Evidence: African American woman with chest pain without traditional atherosclerotic risk factors, findings on coronary angiography could be consistent with SCAD.
3. **Aortic Dissection**
   - Evidence: Retrosternal chest pain radiating to back, but normal chest radiography and lack of widened mediastinum.
4. **Pulmonary Embolism**
   - Evidence: Sudden onset of chest pain, clear lung fields. But less likely given the significant rise in troponin and ST-elevation.
5. **Pericarditis**
   - Evidence: Chest pain, but usually associated with positional changes and widespread ST elevation on ECG rather than localized.
6. **Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy**
   - Evidence: Acute chest pain and cardiac symptoms, but less likely since coronary angiography shows TIMI 2 flow, which is more consistent with a coronary artery problem.
7. **Myocarditis**
   - Evidence: Elevated troponin, but less likely with normal chest radiography and coronary angiography findings indicative of ischemic changes.
8. **Esophageal Spasm**
   - Evidence: Retrosternal chest pain, but ECG and elevated troponin more indicative of cardiac origin.
9. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy**
   - Evidence: Audible fourth heart sound, though echocardiography would be more diagnostic.
10. **Pneumothorax**
    - Evidence: Sudden chest pain, though less likely with normal chest radiography and resolution of symptoms post-pain.","['Radiology', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Acute Coronary Syndromes', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiac Imaging']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,44.0,F

A child younger than 10 years presented with an 8-week history of bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy unresponsive to a 10-day course of Augmentin (GlaxoSmithKline). The patient’s parents denied any associated fevers, chills, night sweats, sore throat, abdominal pain, or weight changes. Medical history was noncontributory. Physical examination showed bilateral, mobile, nontender cervical lymphadenopathy without erythema or swelling. Tonsils were symmetric and not enlarged. There was no noticeable thyromegaly or nodules. Laboratory testing was significant for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (37 mmol/h). Ultrasonography demonstrated cervical lymphadenopathy bilaterally with the largest node measuring 3.8 cm in maximum dimension. Lymph node needle core biopsy demonstrated increased histiocytes and numerous plasma cells on tissue section (Figure, A). Scattered neutrophils and rare giant cells were also present. Findings of Grocott methenamine silver, acid-fast, and Warthin-Starry stains were negative. The CD-68 immunostain showed numerous histiocytes. The specimen stained positive for CD-30 and S-100 immunostains showing emperipolesis (Figure, B and C). Findings of a CD1a stain were negative.

    ",Rosai-Dorfman disease,"### Initial Differential Diagnosis
1. **Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease** 
    - Characterized by prolonged lymphadenopathy, often without systemic symptoms.
2. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**
    - Presents with histiocytosis and can involve cervical lymph nodes.
3. **Rosai-Dorfman Disease**
    - Presents with bilateral, painless lymphadenopathy, histiocytes, and emperipolesis as seen in immunostains.
4. **Infectious Mononucleosis**
    - Common cause of lymphadenopathy in children, typically accompanied by additional symptoms.
5. **Toxoplasmosis**
    - Can present with lymphadenopathy and is often unresponsive to antibiotics.
6. **Cat Scratch Disease**
    - Bartonella infection causing lymphadenopathy, often in a young population.
7. **Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma**
    - Malignant cause of lymphadenopathy, various subtypes can occur in children.
8. **Tuberculosis**
    - Chronic lymphadenopathy often in endemic areas, typically acid-fast positive.
9. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
    - Autoimmune disease that can cause lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms.
10. **Sarcoidosis**
    - Multisystem granulomatous disorder that can present with persistent lymphadenopathy.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis
Based on the patient’s presentation, resistant lymphadenopathy, immunostain results, and biopsy findings:

1. **Rosai-Dorfman Disease**
    - Primary due to classic emperipolesis and CD-68, S-100 positive histiocytes.
2. **Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease**
    - Lack of systemic symptoms, but less likely given histology.
3. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis**
    - Negative CD1a stain makes this less likely.
4. **Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma**
    - Given the lack of monoclonal population seen in flow cytometry, less likely.
5. **Infectious Mononucleosis**
    - Unlikely given no systemic symptoms and lack of typical histological features.
6. **Cat Scratch Disease**
    - Less likely due to the unresponsive nature to Augmentin and histological findings.
7. **Toxoplasmosis**
    - Lower on the list given specific immunohistochemical findings.
8. **Tuberculosis**
    - Acid-fast stain negative makes it less probable.
9. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**
    - Unlikely due to specific lack of autoimmune disease markers.
10. **Sarcoidosis**
    - Lower on the list due to absence of granulomas in biopsy.

Thus, Rosai-Dorfman Disease is the top differential diagnosis, supported by the histopathological findings and immunostain results.","['Pediatrics', 'Otolaryngology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1.0,U

### INPUT:
A man in his 30s presented with a slow-growing mass in the upper lip that had developed over several years. He had no history of underlying medical diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, hepatitis, and tuberculosis. On physical examination, a whitish, firm, painless, nodular mass on the superficial layer of the left upper lip was observed (Figure, A). Given the possibility of a tumorous lesion, complete excision was planned under local anesthesia. In surgery, the 1.5 × 1.2 cm, whitish, firm, nodular, and well-encapsulated mass was excised completely without rupture of the capsule from the surrounding mucosa. On histopathologic examination, an encapsulated salivary gland tumor with epithelial and myoepithelial cells, ductlike structures, and mixed stroma was observed (Figure, B). One month after surgery, the surgical wound on the left upper lip was clean and well healed. One year later, there had been no recurrence, and the patient had no symptoms at the left upper lip.

2. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma** - Common salivary gland tumor with varying presentations that can sometimes mimic benign tumors.
3. **Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma** - This can present as a firm, slow-growing mass in salivary glands with potential for perineural invasion, although typically painful.
4. **Lipoma** - A typically well-encapsulated and slow-growing mass with a usually yellow, soft appearance.
5. **Schwannoma** - A well-encapsulated nerve sheath tumor that can present as a painless and slow-growing nodule.
6. **Dermoid Cyst** - A congenital lesion that can present as a painless, firm mass, though often more cystic on examination.
7. **Fibroma** - A benign fibrous tissue tumor that may present as a firm, nodular mass.
8. **Neurilemmoma** - A benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor similar to schwannoma.
9. **Basal Cell Adenoma** - A benign salivary gland tumor that can also present as a slow-growing, painless mass.
10. **Hemangioma** - Typically appears during infancy but can occasionally present later and appear as a firm, nodular mass.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Post-Analysis

1. **Pleomorphic Adenoma** - The presence of epithelial and myoepithelial cells, ductlike structures, and mixed stroma on histopathologic examination confirms this diagnosis.
2. **Basal Cell Adenoma** - Considered due to its benign nature and encapsulation, but less common comparative to pleomorphic adenoma.
3. **Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma** - While common, it does not fit the benign histopathologic findings perfectly.
4. **Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma** - Though consistent with being a salivary gland tumor, it is often painful and has distinct histology.
5. **Schwannoma** - Benign and encapsulated but typical histology differs from salivary gland origin.
6. **Neurilemmoma** - Similar to schwannoma, lacking mixed stroma characteristic of pleomorphic adenoma.
7. **Fibroma** - Generally lacks the mixed cellular components seen in histopathological examination.
8. **Dermoid Cyst** - Less likely given typical presentation and non-salivary gland origin.
9. **Lipoma** - Not supported by histopathologic details provided.
10. **Hemangioma** - Inconsistent with the firm, nodular pathology and histological findings.

### INPUT:
A 40-year-old healthy woman presented with an 8-year history of a slowly growing erythematous plaque on the left lower eyelid, with occasional discomfort. Physical examination revealed a single erythematous scaling plaque involving the left lower eyelid, including its border. Eyelashes were totally absent (Figure 1A). No other lesions were found after complete physical examination. Dermoscopy showed an erythematous background, telangiectatic vessels, whitish structureless areas, and whitish scales (Figure 1B). A 4-mm punch biopsy specimen was obtained (Figure 1C). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Discoid lupus erythematosus,"1. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**
   - Chronic, slowly growing erythematous lesion with telangiectasia and scale is characteristic.

2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**
   - Also presents as erythematous scaling plaque and can grow over years, common on sun-exposed areas.

3. **Seborrheic Keratosis**
   - Presents as a slowly growing plaque with scaling, typically benign and can mimic other lesions.

4. **Actinic Keratosis**
   - Pre-malignant lesion often found in sun-exposed areas, presenting as erythematous plaques or papules with scaling.

5. **Bowen Disease**
   - In situ form of SCC presenting as a persistent erythematous, scaly plaque.

6. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE)**
   - Presents as an erythematous, scaling plaque commonly on sun-exposed areas such as the face.

7. **Mycosis Fungoides (MF)**
   - A type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma presenting as persistent erythematous, scaling plaques.

8. **Chronic Dermatitis**
   - Persistent erythematous plaques with scaling which can occasionally experience discomfort.

9. **Psoriasis**
   - Erythematous plaques with significant scaling and telangiectasia, though typically presents symmetrically.

10. **Contact Dermatitis**
   - Erythematous, scaling plaques often due to allergic or irritant contact, though usually more acute.

### Reranking based on patient information and biopsy results:

1. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**
   - Most consistent with the chronic nature, morphology, absence of multifocal involvement, and dermoscopy findings of erythematous background and telangiectasia.

2. **Bowen Disease (SCC in situ)**
   - Can present similarly with a persistent erythematous, scaly plaque, and often requires histological confirmation to differentiate from BCC.

3. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**
   - Common in sun-exposed areas and can present similarly, especially with chronicity.

4. **Actinic Keratosis**
   - Presents as erythematous, scaling patches or plaques and can be pre-cancerous, usually less persistent than described.

5. **Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE)**
   - Can present with similar skin findings but typically in a different pattern and associated with other systemic findings.

6. **Mycosis Fungoides (MF)**
   - A slower-growing lesion but usually more widespread and with multi-lesion involvement over time.

7. **Chronic Dermatitis**
   - Less likely given the chronic nature and confinement to a single lesion without multifocal features.

8. **Psoriasis**
   - Not typically localized to a single area and the absence of other common psoriasis features like nail changes or additional plaques.

9. **Seborrheic Keratosis**
   - While it can mimic other lesions, typically has different histological findings and does not cause complete hair loss.

10. **Contact Dermatitis**
   - Less likely due to the chronicity and localized nature of the lesion presented.

Each diagnosis was considered based on the clinical presentation, physical examination findings, and in the context of chronicity and localized nature of the patient's lesion.

### INPUT:
A man in his late 20s presented with mildly itchy, erythematous plaques of 3 months’ duration on both legs. The lesions started to appear on the left pretibial region as small papules, which gradually increased in size and coalesced to form bigger plaques. No history of local trauma, prolonged standing, and occupational exposure to mineral dust or recent drug intake was recollected. He was not diabetic. On examination, large, ill-defined, erythematous plaques were present on the pretibial areas extending onto the lateral aspect of both legs. The plaques were surmounted by multiple, discrete atrophic scars. The periphery of the plaques showed increased vascularity in the form of telangiectasias and venous prominences, along with atrophy of the overlying skin (Figure, A). There were no lesions elsewhere on the body. A skin biopsy sample was obtained from the plaque and sent for histopathological examination (Figure, B and C).

2. **Psoriasis**: Can present with erythematous plaques but usually has a different distribution and scale pattern.
3. **Sarcoidosis**: Can present with papules and plaques but typically involves other systemic symptoms.
4. **Lichen Planus**: Usually presents with pruritic, violaceous, flat-topped papules, more common on wrists, and oral involvement.
5. **Granuloma Annulare**: Typically presents as annular lesions, not usually as atrophic plaques.
6. **Mycosis Fungoides**: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, can present with plaques but tends to have different histopathological features.
7. **Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus**: Usually has more pronounced systemic symptoms and distinct histopathological features.
8. **Dermatitis Herpetiformis**: Typically presents with intensely pruritic, vesicular rash, often on extensor surfaces.
9. **Erythema Nodosum**: Presents as tender nodules, usually on the shins, rather than plaques.

### INPUT:
A Korean American woman in her early 60s was referred for evaluation of bilateral acute-angle closure and retinal detachments. She had emmetropia, and her ocular and medical history were unremarkable. Over the preceding few days, she noticed worsening blurry vision with redness in both eyes associated with headaches, nausea, and severe tinnitus. On presentation, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/200 OD and 20/400 OS. Intraocular pressure was 45 mm Hg OU. Pupils were 4 mm and minimally reactive. There was 1+ conjunctival injection, diffuse corneal edema with Descemet folds, and the anterior chamber was shallow in both eyes. After the administration of multiple rounds of topical and oral medications, her intraocular pressure improved to 18 mm Hg OD and 19 mm Hg OS. A dilated fundus examination revealed tilted discs, serous retinal detachments, and multiple yellow, depigmented chorioretinal spots throughout the posterior pole in both eyes. B-scan ultrasonography showed shallow retinal detachments, choroidal thickening, and extensive, shallow choroidal detachments extending anteriorly in both eyes (Figure 1A). A-scan ultrasonography showed normal axial length of 22 mm OU. Optical coherence tomography indicated subretinal fluid and enhanced depth imaging demonstrated significant choroidal thickening in both eyes (Figure 1B). Fluorescein angiography revealed pinpoint hyperfluorescence with leakage. Indocyanine green angiography showed diffuse leakage throughout the posterior pole in both eyes. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease,"## Differential Diagnosis Steps

1. **Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma (PACG)**: Given the acute onset of symptoms including high intraocular pressure, headaches, nausea, and redness in both eyes.
   
2. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome (UES)**: Due to the presence of shallow retinal detachments, choroidal thickening, and choroidal detachments.
   
3. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC)**: Consider the presence of serous retinal detachments and subretinal fluid.

4. **Posterior Scleritis**: It can present with choroidal thickening, ocular pain, and serous retinal detachments.

5. **Panuveitis**: Given the inflammation presentation with multiple rounds of topical and oral medications leading to improvement in intraocular pressure.

6. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease (VKH)**: Presenting with bilateral serous retinal detachments, choroidal thickening, and multiple yellow chorioretinal spots.

7. **Sympathetic Ophthalmia**: Considering the autoimmune response that can cause widespread ocular inflammation, including serous retinal detachments.

8. **Hypertensive Choroidopathy**: Due to the high intraocular pressure possibly reflecting systemic hypertension impacts on ocular structures.

9. **Malignant Hypertension**: Due to the systemic symptoms and acute-angle closure glaucoma which might indicate high blood pressure impacts.

10. **Choroidal Malignancy (e.g., Uveal Melanoma or Metastasis)**: Presents with choroidal thickening and could cause retinal detachments and other signs similar to those noted.

## Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease (VKH)**: This explains the bilateral nature, choroidal thickening, serous retinal detachments, and multiple yellow chorioretinal spots in a patient without significant previous ocular history.
   
2. **Uveal Effusion Syndrome (UES)**: Consistent with choroidal thickening, choroidal detachments, and normal axial length.

3. **Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma (PACG)**: Given the dramatic presentation with high intraocular pressure relieved with treatment, but bilateral presentation of such acute cases is less common without a precipitating factor.

4. **Panuveitis**: Inflammation and response to treatment fit, though specific findings like choroidal thickening favor VKH or UES more.

5. **Posterior Scleritis**: Choroidal thickening and serous retinal detachment can be seen but lacks typical pain or T-sign on ultrasonography.

6. **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC)**: Fits with subretinal fluid but less likely due to bilateral severe presentation and choroidal thickening.

7. **Hypertensive Choroidopathy**: Acute high pressure effects considered but less specific in explaining choroidal detachment and retinal spots.

8. **Sympathetic Ophthalmia**: Both autoimmunity and these specific retinal signs are considered, but usually follows trauma history.

9. **Malignant Hypertension**: Similar systemic implications as Hypertensive Choroidopathy but less directly linked to observed ocular features.

10. **Choroidal Malignancy (e.g., Uveal Melanoma or Metastasis)**: Explains some retinal detachments and thickening but inconsistent with overall systemic signs and bilateral chronicity.","['Ophthalmology', 'Retinal Disorders']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,60.0,F

### INPUT:
An African American woman in her 30s with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma of the right lower extremity, with a medical history of above-knee right leg amputation, received treatment with nivolumab (an anti–programmed cell death 1 [anti–PD-1] antibody) with an initial good tolerance. Her medical history was negative for any skin cancers. After 2 months of treatment, the patient presented with diffuse hyperpigmented macules. This was thought to be related to her chronic atopic dermatitis and she was prescribed topical steroids and moisturizing. Four months later the patient presented with diffuse macular cutaneous eruption and pruritus. A skin punch biopsy of the back revealed mild epidermal acanthosis, focal parakeratosis, and interface dermatitis with numerous dyskeratotic cells and underlying lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate with scattered dermal melanophages. Oral steroids were prescribed and 3 weeks later the rash had resolved; however, the patient developed numerous hypopigmented macules and patches, covering more than 30% of her body surface area (Figure, A) compared with the prior skin examination (Figure, B). A new biopsy showed epithelial basal vacuolar changes, underlying lichenoid lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with scattered eosinophils and interface dermatitis with marked pigment incontinence and a reduced number of junctional melanocytes (Figure, C). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Vitiligo,"Sure, let's approach this case step by step, considering differential diagnoses based on the information provided and then rerank them after evaluating all patient information and test results.

### Step-by-Step Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Drug-induced vitiligo:** Given the history of immunotherapy (nivolumab), drug-induced vitiligo is a reasonable initial consideration.
2. **Lichen planus:** This condition can cause pruritus and a lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate.
3. **Pityriasis versicolor:** This fungal infection can result in hypopigmented macules.
4. **Post-inflammatory hypopigmentation:** Chronic atopic dermatitis and recent inflammation could cause changes in pigmentation.
5. **Sarcoidosis:** Given the African American background and skin changes, sarcoidosis could be a possibility.
6. **Idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis:** Common in individuals with skin pigmentation changes.
7. **Leprosy:** Might consider given chronicity and hypopigmented patches although uncommon.
8. **Cutaneous lupus erythematosus:** The described rash and the biochemistry could fit.
9. **Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma):** Considered given unexplained chronic skin changes and infiltrate.
10. **Graft versus host disease:** Although less common, consider if any history of transplantation or transfusions relevant to immunotherapy.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis: 
1. **Drug-induced vitiligo:** Most likely given the temporal association with nivolumab, a drug known for immune-related adverse effects.
2. **Lichen planus:** Fits with biopsy findings of lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate and epidermal changes.
3. **Post-inflammatory hypopigmentation:** Given the recent history of rash and inflammatory response.
4. **Cutaneous lupus erythematosus:** Corresponds with chronic pruritic rash and histological findings.
5. **Sarcoidosis:** Although skin involvement in sarcoidosis typically presents differently, it cannot be completely excluded due to her ethnic background.
6. **Pityriasis versicolor:** Fungal infections can cause hypopigmented lesions but less likely with noted biopsy findings.
7. **Idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis:** Often more benign and not associated with such significant systemic symptoms but fits hypopigmented description.
8. **Mycosis fungoides:** Serious consideration for skin changes but typically presents in a more specific pattern.
9. **Graft versus host disease:** Less likely without history of transplantation.
10. **Leprosy:** Unlikely due to uncommon presentation and geographical considerations.

Considering all patient information, clinical presentation, and test results, it is crucial to focus on immune-related adverse events given the medical history and timing of nivolumab use, supporting the top-ranked diagnosis of drug-induced vitiligo.","['Dermatology', 'Oncology', 'Vitiligo', 'Targeted and Immune Therapy']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,30.0,F

### INPUT:
A man in his mid-20s with no significant medical history presented with 18 months of progressive dyspnea, abdominal distention, and lower extremity edema. A chest radiograph showed significant cardiomegaly. A transthoracic echocardiogram (Figure 1) revealed a mildly dilated, hypertrophied right ventricle (RV) with normal function and significant right atrial (RA) enlargement (107 cm2). The tricuspid annulus was dilated (48 mm) with severe tricuspid regurgitation. There were no significant abnormalities of the left ventricle, left atrium, or pulmonic, mitral, and aortic valves. Invasive hemodynamic measures showed elevated RA pressure (14 mm Hg), but normal pulmonary artery pressure (16/11 mm Hg) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (7 mm Hg). Cardiac index calculated by the Fick method was 2.46 L/min/m2. Aggressive diuresis was initiated. 
### OUTPUT:

### Differential Diagnosis Steps:

1. **Constrictive Pericarditis**
2. **Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy**
3. **Right Atrial Myxoma**
4. **Tricuspid Valve Endocarditis**
5. **Ebstein's Anomaly**
6. **Primary Tricuspid Regurgitation**
7. **Cor Pulmonale**
8. **Cardiac Sarcoidosis**
9. **Carcinoid Heart Disease**
10. **Right Heart Failure due to Pulmonary Hypertension**

### Reevaluating Based on All Information:

1. **Primary Tricuspid Regurgitation**
   - The echocardiogram findings particularly highlight severe tricuspid regurgitation and RA enlargement which can directly lead to symptoms of dyspnea and edema without other significant valve defects or left heart involvement.
2. **Ebstein's Anomaly**
   - Fits with severe tricuspid regurgitation and cardiomegaly; typically presents in young adulthood.
3. **Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy**
   - The progressive nature of symptoms and the right ventricular involvement could suggest a cardiomyopathy confined to the right side.
4. **Constrictive Pericarditis**
   - Although less likely due to the normal pulmonary pressures, it can occasionally present similarly.
5. **Tricuspid Valve Endocarditis**
   - Possible due to the isolated severe tricuspid problem though less likely without history of IV drug use or other risk factors.
6. **Right Atrial Myxoma**
   - Can present with RA dilation and symptoms of right heart failure, though typically seen with some obstructive symptoms.
7. **Right Heart Failure due to Pulmonary Hypertension**
   - RA and RV dilation with severe tricuspid regurgitation aligns, but the normal pulmonary artery pressures make this a secondary possibility.
8. **Carcinoid Heart Disease**
   - Less likely without significant gastrointestinal symptoms or history, but can cause similar cardiac findings.
9. **Cardiac Sarcoidosis**
   - Possible granulomatous involvement of the right heart causing similar findings.
10. **Cor Pulmonale**
   - Given normal pulmonary artery pressures, this is less likely.

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 61-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 4-week history of severe weakness and difficulty ambulating independently. He had difficulty rising from a seated position. Additional symptoms included progressive numbness and tingling of the hands and feet. His family also reported progressive memory impairment during this period. An extensive review of systems was otherwise unremarkable, except for a few months of intermittent nausea, increased abdominal bloating, and anorexia. Physical examination revealed normal vital signs, normal cardiopulmonary findings, atrophy in the calf muscles bilaterally, 4 of 5 symmetric strength in the upper and lower extremity extensor muscles, and an unsteady shuffling gait. He had decreased vibration and proprioception in both lower extremities, with hyperreflexia and a positive Babinski reflex on the left side. Mental status examination revealed delayed recall of 1 of 4 words. Complete blood cell count revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 103/μL; hemoglobin level, 10.9 g/dL; hematocrit, 31.8%; and platelet count, 202 × 103/μL. Mean corpuscular volume was 119 fL. Results of renal function and liver function tests were normal.

1. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)** - Given the progressive weakness, muscle atrophy, and hyperreflexia.
2. **Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)** - Considering the progressive weakness, numbness, and tingling.
3. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)** - Similar to GBS but with a more chronic course.
4. **Vitamin B12 Deficiency** - Due to memory impairment, numbness, and macrocytic anemia.
5. **Myasthenia Gravis** - Due to progressive weakness and difficulty rising from seated position.
6. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)** - Due to asymmetric hyperreflexia and progressive neurological symptoms.
7. **Peripheral Neuropathy** (e.g., Diabetic, Toxic) - Due to numbness and tingling in extremities.
8. **Spinal Cord Compression** - Asymmetric hyperreflexia and unsteady gait may suggest this.
9. **Alzheimer's Disease** - Memory impairment and progressive neurological decline.
10. **Parkinson's Disease** - Unsteady shuffling gait and muscular weakness.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results:

1. **Vitamin B12 Deficiency** - Elevated MCV, anemia, neurological symptoms including numbness, tingling, and memory issues.
2. **Spinal Cord Compression** - MRI findings, asymmetric hyperreflexia, and shuffling gait.
3. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)** - Muscle atrophy, hyperreflexia, and progressive weakness.
4. **Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)** - Progressive weakness and sensory changes.
5. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)** - As mix of motor and sensory deficits with chronic course.
6. **Peripheral Neuropathy** (e.g., Diabetic, Toxic) - Numbness and tingling in extremities.
7. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)** - Neurological symptoms, although typically this would present at a younger age.
8. **Parkinson's Disease** - Shuffling gait and muscle weakness.
9. **Myasthenia Gravis** - Progressive weakness though typically would have fluctuating course.
10. **Alzheimer's Disease** - Memory issues but less prominent motor and sensory changes.

In this case, considering the combination of symptoms and test results, Vitamin B12 Deficiency ranks high due to anemia, elevated MCV, and neurological symptoms. Further confirmatory tests such as Vitamin B12 levels, methylmalonic acid, and homocysteine levels would be warranted.","['Neurology', 'Neuroimaging', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine', 'Hematology', 'Dementia and Cognitive Impairment']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,61.0,M

An elderly man presented to the emergency department describing unremitting pain in the left iliac fossa with accompanying tenderness, fever, and tachypnea. He also noted swelling in his left inguinofemoral region, left scrotum, and left femur. His symptoms started 2 days before admission and the pain was progressively worsening. The patient did not report vomiting, constipation, or change in his bowel habits. His history was significant for hypertension and hypothyroidism; his last colonoscopy, 4 years ago, revealed diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. The patient’s condition was stable (blood pressure, 130/85 mm Hg, heart rate, 88 beats/min), but he was febrile (temperature, 38.6°C). Physical examination showed cellulitis in his left inguinal canal, scrotum, and femur along with sensitivity in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. Initial laboratory test findings exhibited white blood cell count of 16 700/μL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 0.001) and C-reactive protein of 340 mg/L (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524). Chest roentgenogram was negative for free air under the diaphragm but was remarkable for some air-fluid levels.

1. **Diverticulitis** - Given the patient’s history of diverticulosis and symptoms including left iliac fossa pain, fever, and elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein. 

2. **Inguinal Hernia with Strangulation** - Suggested by inguinofemoral and scrotal swelling, left iliac fossa pain, and tenderness.

3. **Psoas Abscess** - Left-sided abdominal pain, fever, elevated inflammatory markers, and cellulitis of the inguinal region.

4. **Epididymo-orchitis** - Pain and swelling in the scrotum with fever and elevated inflammatory markers.

5. **Cellulitis** - Obvious cellulitis in the left inguinal area and extending to the femur, coupled with systemic signs of infection.

6. **Septic Arthritis** - Fever, localized pain, swelling in the inguinofemoral region, and elevated serum inflammatory markers.

7. **Abdominal Wall Abscess** - Localized pain and tenderness, fever, swelling, and evidence of infection.

8. **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)** - Swelling of the left leg, though more typically associated with unilateral leg pain and swelling rather than constitutional symptoms like fever.

9. **Infectious Colitis** - Fever, elevated white cell count, abdominal pain, inflamed colon potentially visible on imaging.

10. **Ischemic Colitis** - Persistent abdominal pain, fever, elevated CRP and white count, and history of vascular risk factors.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Diverticulitis** - The primary diagnosis due to history, current presentation, and imaging findings. Common cause of left iliac fossa pain and systemic symptoms.
   
2. **Inguinal Hernia with Strangulation** - Important cause of acute left lower quadrant pain and scrotal/inquinal swelling.
   
3. **Psoas Abscess** - Fits the presentation of fever, pain, and cellulitis, along with evoking systemic inflammation.
   
4. **Abdominal Wall Abscess** - Localized abdominal tenderness, fever, and signs of systemic infection.
   
5. **Cellulitis** - Presenting cellulitis in the described regions could be primary or secondary to another deeper infection.
   
6. **Epididymo-orchitis** - Scrotal swelling and pain with fever and systemic inflammatory response.
   
7. **Septic Arthritis** - Considered due to systemic infection signs and localized pain and swelling near an articulating joint.
   
8. **Infectious Colitis** - Given systemic signs, though less likely due to lack of gastrointestinal symptoms.
   
9. **Ischemic Colitis** - Pain and systemic signs of inflammation favor it, yet less likely without GI bleeding history.
   
10. **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)** - Though leg swelling is noted, DVT less specifically fits all presented systemic signs and symptoms.","['Geriatrics', 'Surgery', 'Pain Medicine', 'Urology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,70.0,M

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis
Based on all available patient information and test results:

1. **Orbital Cellulitis** - Likely exacerbated by recent bilateral ear infection and symptoms of proptosis.
2. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - Given the rapid development of orbital signs and bitemporal facial swelling.
3. **Neuroblastoma** - Common pediatric cancer with possible metastasis to the orbital region.
4. **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis** - Known to cause bone lesions and can affect the orbit.
5. **Leukemia** - Can present with cranial nerve signs and systemic symptoms like irritability and fever.
6. **Chronic Sinusitis** - Recurrent ear infections and potential spread resulting in proptosis.
7. **Sinus Venous Thrombosis** - Less common but can present with cranial nerve palsies and proptosis.
8. **Lymphoma** - Pediatric tumors may metastasize to the orbit, though less common in this age group.
9. **Retinoblastoma** - Although less likely without direct ocular involvement, it should not be ruled out without imaging.
10. **Orbital Hemangioma** - Usually congenital and more stable in presentation, making it lower on the differential.","['Ophthalmology', 'Orbit', 'Pediatrics', 'Pediatric Cancer', 'Oncology']",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1.0,M

### INPUT:
A middle-aged white woman presented to the ophthalmology clinic for a third opinion. The patient had been experiencing redness, tearing, and foreign-body sensation in both eyes for 7 months. She was diagnosed with giant papillary conjunctivitis and follicular conjunctivitis by ophthalmologists at other institutions and was treated with topical corticosteroids and oral doxycycline. Topical corticosteroid eyedrops (0.5% loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension) seemed to control her symptoms, but attempts to wean the medication resulted in recurrence. She denied any significant ocular history. Her medical history included hypothyroidism and breast cancer in the setting of Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with a predisposition to various cancers, including carcinoma of the colon, breast, and uterus. At the time of examination, visual acuity was 20/25 OU. Pupil anatomy, intraocular pressure, confrontation visual fields, and extraocular movements were within normal limits. Slitlamp examination revealed mild meibomian gland dysfunction bilaterally, and follicular conjunctivitis was evident on eversion of all 4 eyelids. The bulbar conjunctiva demonstrated hyperemia and elevation medially (Figure 1). The remainder of the examination, including dilated funduscopic examination, was within normal limits. 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Benign lymphoid hyperplasia,"### Initial Differential Diagnoses

1. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)**:
   - Rationale: Chronic conjunctivitis with a history of being managed with corticosteroids may correlate with SJS, especially if there are systemic involvement or dermatologic features.

2. **Ocular Cicatricial Pemphigoid**:
   - Rationale: A chronic, progressive conjunctivitis that doesn't respond to standard treatment could point towards autoimmune etiologies.

3. **Allergic Conjunctivitis**:
   - Rationale: Persistent ocular symptoms and therapeutic response to corticosteroids often suggest allergic causes.

4. **Viral Conjunctivitis**:
   - Rationale: Follicular conjunctivitis can often be caused by viral infections, such as adenovirus.

5. **Sjogren's Syndrome**:
   - Rationale: Autoimmune diseases should be considered, particularly in a patient with a known history of autoimmune conditions like hypothyroidism.

6. **Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis**:
   - Rationale: Atopic conditions can lead to chronic eye symptoms and often respond partially but not completely to corticosteroids.

7. **Chlamydial Conjunctivitis**:
   - Rationale: Sexually transmitted infections can cause chronic follicular conjunctivitis.

8. **Medicamentosa**:
   - Rationale: A history of long-term topical medication use could lead to medicamentosa, a type of drug-induced conjunctivitis.

9. **Primary Acquired Melanosis (PAM) with atypia**:
   - Rationale: Hyperemia and medial conjunctival elevation may prompt examination for atypical lesions, especially given the patient's Lynch syndrome.

10. **Ocular Rosacea**:
    - Rationale: Meibomian gland dysfunction suggests an inflammatory component possibly related to rosacea.

### Reranked Differential Diagnoses (Final Diagnosis):

1. **Ocular Cicatricial Pemphigoid**:
   - Detailed evaluation underscores a progressive, treatment-resistant inflammatory condition accurately fitting the reported symptoms.

2. **Allergic Conjunctivitis**:
   - Given symptom relief with corticosteroids, chronic allergenic exposure is plausible despite the recurrence post-treatment.

3. **Sjogren's Syndrome**:
   - Systemic autoimmune condition could explain chronic ophthalmic issues.

4. **Medicamentosa**:
   - Long-standing topical corticosteroid use can lead to toxicity and persistent symptoms.

5. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)**:
   - Though less likely without systemic symptoms, chronic conjunctivitis with recurrence suggests potentially missed SJS diagnosis.

6. **Ocular Rosacea**:
   - Meibomian gland dysfunction is significant; requires consideration given the chronicity of symptoms.

7. **Chlamydial Conjunctivitis**:
   - Should be ruled out with appropriate testing given the persistent follicular conjunctivitis.

8. **Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis**:
   - Another chronic inflammatory condition warranting detailed allergy and immunology review.

9. **Viral Conjunctivitis**:
   - Less likely given the prolonged course and lack of systemic viral symptoms but still conceivable.

10. **Primary Acquired Melanosis (PAM) with atypia**:
    - Though rare, necessary to rule out given the patient’s Lynch syndrome and conjunctival hyperemia and elevation.

### Summary:
- **Ocular Cicatricial Pemphigoid** emerges as the top differential following a detailed re-evaluation considering the chronicity and partial response to corticosteroids. Next steps should explore this through specific conjunctival biopsy and immunofluorescence. This ensures proper management and prevents potential progressive ocular surface disease.","['External Eye Disease', 'Ophthalmology', 'Trauma and Injury']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,45.0,F

### INPUT:
A 46-year-old man with salivary duct carcinoma of the right parotid gland presented for evaluation of a 3-week history of multiple new pruritic skin lesions on the right chest. The patient’s salivary duct carcinoma was androgen receptor positive and HER2 positive. He had previously undergone parotidectomy followed by radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab. He had continued with androgen-deprivation therapy and palliative radiation therapy for osseous metastases. The patient endorsed erythematous skin changes within the field of radiation and a 2-month history of painful right upper extremity lymphedema that began after his most recent radiation treatment. He denied fevers or other systemic symptoms associated with the onset of the skin lesions. Physical examination revealed numerous nontender, firm, pebblelike, pink papules on the right anterior neck, upper chest, and back, arising on a background of confluent blanchable violaceous erythema (Figure, A), as well as similar-appearing lesions on the right chest wall on a background of normal-appearing skin. Concurrent skin biopsies from the right chest wall, clavicular area, and upper right back were performed (Figure, B and C). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Cutaneous metastasis,"**Step 1: Radiation Dermatitis**
- **Rationale:** The patient has a history of radiation therapy, and erythematous skin changes occur within the field of radiation.

**Step 2: Lymphedema-associated Dermopathy**
- **Rationale:** The patient has painful lymphedema of the right upper extremity, often associated with altered skin conditions.

**Step 3: Cutaneous Metastasis**
- **Rationale:** The patient has a known history of advanced carcinoma, and new skin lesions can represent metastatic disease.

**Step 4: Herpes Zoster (Shingles)**
- **Rationale:** New, pruritic, and painful skin lesions can point to zoster infection, particularly in immunocompromised individuals due to cancer therapy.

**Step 5: Contact Dermatitis**
- **Rationale:** Pruritic skin lesions can result from exposure to irritants or allergens especially in areas of radiation-damaged skin.

**Step 6: Drug Eruption**
- **Rationale:** The patient has been on multiple drugs, and new lesions might be drug-induced.

**Step 7: Cellulitis**
- **Rationale:** Erythema and painful skin could suggest infection, particularly with breached skin barriers post-radiation.

**Step 8: Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans**
- **Rationale:** New firm papules within an area of previous radiation can suggest secondary malignancies.

**Step 9: Xanthomatosis**
- **Rationale:** Pebble-like skin lesions may point to lipid metabolism disorders, which can present systemic issues in cancer patients.

**Step 10: Prurigo Nodularis**
- **Rationale:** Chronic pruritic conditions can present with similar nodular skin changes.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis

1. **Cutaneous Metastasis**
   - **Reason:** Given the patient’s history of advanced cancer and firm, nontender papules over multiple areas.
2. **Radiation Dermatitis**
   - **Reason:** Erythematous changes within the radiation field.
3. **Lymphedema-associated Dermopathy**
   - **Reason:** A new painful lymphedema and altered skin changes could point to this.
4. **Contact Dermatitis**
   - **Reason:** Prior radiation-damaged skin is more susceptible to irritants causing new lesions.
5. **Drug Eruption**
   - **Reason:** The patient’s extensive medication regime could induce skin changes.
6. **Herpes Zoster (Shingles)**
   - **Reason:** Pruritic painful lesions, especially with cancer therapy weakening the immune response.
7. **Cellulitis**
   - **Reason:** Erythema and pain could suggest an infection in compromised skin regions.
8. **Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans**
   - **Reason:** Previous radiation can induce secondary skin malignancies.
9. **Xanthomatosis**
   - **Reason:** Though less likely, lipid metabolism issues can present with pebble-like skin lesions.
10. **Prurigo Nodularis**
   - **Reason:** Less likely given the patient’s history, but chronic pruritic conditions need consideration.","['Dermatology', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Oncology', 'Otolaryngology', 'Salivary Gland Disorders']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,46.0,M

### INPUT:
A man in his 30s with a medical history of asthma, social history of smoking, and allergy to shellfish presented to the emergency department with tongue swelling. The patient reported a history of a local burn from hot food but denied any history of trauma, foreign body, or piercing. He was evaluated, given a presumptive diagnosis of sialadenitis, and discharged home with ibuprofen and clindamycin. He returned several days later with worsening tongue swelling, voice change, and subjective fever. Postcontrast axial computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a midline lesion within the oral tongue that was predominantly hypodense and demonstrated rim enhancement. No calcifications were seen within the lesion (Figure, A). The lesion was predominantly isointense to muscle on axial T1-weighted images without intravenous (IV) contrast (Figure, B). Axial T2-weighted images with fat saturation showed predominantly hyperintense signal relative to muscle as well as punctate internal foci of T2 hypointensity (not shown). The lesion was hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (Figure, C) and hypointense on the apparent diffusion coefficient map (not shown). Sagittal T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with IV contrast and fat suppression demonstrated signal hypointense to muscle centrally with peripheral enhancement (Figure, D). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Abscess,"Let's start with an initial list of possible diagnoses based on the presented case, and then refine and rank them using all the available patient information and test results.

### Step 1:
**Primary Differential Diagnosis:**
1. Lingual Abscess

### Step 2:
**Secondary Differential Diagnosis:**
2. Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma

### Step 3:
**Tertiary Differential Diagnosis:**
3. Hemangioma

### Step 4:
**Quaternary Differential Diagnosis:**
4. Ludwig's Angina

### Step 5:
**Quinary Differential Diagnosis:**
5. Cysticercosis (Neurocysticercosis involving the tongue)

### Step 6:
**Senary Differential Diagnosis:**
6. Sarcoma

### Step 7:
**Septenary Differential Diagnosis:**
7. Lymphatic Malformation (Lymphangioma)

### Step 8:
**Octonary Differential Diagnosis:**
8. Mucous Retention Cyst (Ranula)

### Step 9:
**Nonary Differential Diagnosis:**
9. Lipoma

### Step 10:
**Denary Differential Diagnosis:**
10. Infectious Mononucleosis (with tonsillar involvement extending to the tongue)

### Reranking based on clinical information and imaging findings:
Given the imaging characteristics (predominantly hypodense lesion with rim enhancement on CT, predominantly isointense on T1, hyperintense on T2 and diffusion-weighted imaging, and hypointense on the ADC map), the most likely diagnosis is a lesion with an infectious/inflammatory nature. 

1. **Lingual Abscess** - The imaging findings, particularly the rim enhancement, central hypodensity on CT, and hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted imaging, are highly suggestive of an abscess. This fits with the clinical presentation of worsening swelling and fever.
2. **Ludwig's Angina** - This is another critical differential due to the severe life-threatening nature of the condition, often presenting with floor of the mouth and tongue swelling.
3. **Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - While less likely given the acute nature of the patient's symptoms, it must still be considered due to the risk factors (smoking history).
4. **Lymphatic Malformation (Lymphangioma)** - Can present with cystic spaces and might show similar imaging features but less likely because of the acute symptomatology.
5. **Hemangioma** - Vascular malformations can present with similar imaging features, but the patient's acute presentation makes this less likely.
6. **Sarcoma** - Soft tissue sarcomas could be considered, but the imaging and clinical presentation lean more towards infectious or inflammatory pathology.
7. **Mucous Retention Cyst (Ranula)** - Usually presents with clear cystic features but less likely to cause such acute systemic symptoms.
8. **Cysticercosis** - Neurocysticercosis causing tongue involvement is rare and less likely given the acute presentation.
9. **Lipoma** - Typically presents as a well-circumscribed, homogenous mass and is less likely to show the described imaging features.
10. **Infectious Mononucleosis** - Usually presents with more systemic lymphadenopathy and pharyngitis; tongue involvement is atypical.

### Conclusion:
The reranked differential diagnoses heavily favor infectious etiologies due to the imaging characteristics and clinical presentation. Further diagnostic workup like aspiration and culture analysis or biopsy may be required to definitively diagnose the condition.","['Radiology', 'Trauma and Injury', 'Neuroimaging', 'Neurology', 'Otolaryngology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,30.0,M

### INPUT:
A previously healthy 18-year-old college student presented to the emergency department with a 6-month history of fatigue, dry cough, dyspnea, and unintentional weight loss of 18 kg (from 100 to 82 kg). Four months ago, he was treated for presumed pneumonia with azithromycin without improvement. He did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use intravenous drugs. He was born in the United States and had not traveled outside of the country. He took no medications. On examination, his temperature was 37°C, heart rate 110/min, blood pressure 123/72 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 20/min. He had a palpable 2×2-cm firm, nontender, right supraclavicular lymph node and decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion in the right lower lung field. No hepatosplenomegaly or leg edema was noted. Routine laboratory tests, including complete blood cell counts, renal function, electrolytes, and hepatic function, were within normal limits. A chest x-ray demonstrated diffuse homogeneous opacification of the right lung field. Computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a 15 × 11-cm centrally necrotic mass in the right anterior mediastinum displacing the trachea to the left, a large right pleural effusion, and compression of the superior vena cava (Figure 1). 
### OUTPUT:
    ",Hodgkin lymphoma,"### Step-by-step Differential Diagnosis
1. **Lymphoma** - The presence of a large mediastinal mass, constitutional symptoms (fatigue, weight loss), and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy are highly suggestive.
2. **Tuberculosis** - Symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, cough, and a large mass could represent a tuberculoma, even though no travel history or TB exposure.
3. **Lung Cancer** - While less common in young patients, a large mass in the mediastinum and significant weight loss could be indicative.
4. **Thymoma** - Anterior mediastinal mass could represent a thymoma, particularly if there are associated symptoms like cough and dyspnea.
5. **Germ Cell Tumor** - This age group is consistent with the development of germ cell tumors, which can present as large mediastinal masses.
6. **Sarcoidosis** - Can present with pulmonary involvement, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and constitutional symptoms, although not typically this extensive.
7. **Histoplasmosis** - Fungal infections could present with a chronic course, nodal involvement, and pulmonary findings.
8. **Bronchogenic Cyst** - Though more typically discovered incidentally, a large cyst could present with compressive symptoms and large opacification.
9. **Mediastinal Abscess** - Considered with a long-standing history of symptoms and a possible necrotic appearance, though less likely without fever.
10. **Chronic Pulmonary Embolism** - Chronic emboli could potentially lead to large conglomerate lesions; however, it is atypical for such a significant mass.

### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Based on All Information and Test Results
1. **Lymphoma** - Considering the common age group, presence of a large necrotic mediastinal mass, significant weight loss, and constitutional symptoms, lymphoma (likely Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin) is most likely.
2. **Germ Cell Tumor** - The combination of young age and a large anterior mediastinal mass strongly supports this possibility, even more so involving the necrotic nature.
3. **Lung Cancer** - Although rare in this age group, the chronicity and size of the mass warrant consideration.
4. **Thymoma** - An anterior mediastinal mass is consistent with thymoma, making it a significant possibility.
5. **Tuberculosis** - Though partially fitting due to symptoms, lack of exposure history and typical radiographic features make it less likely.
6. **Sarcoidosis** - The chest imaging findings are not characteristic of sarcoidosis, though the systemic involvement supports considering it.
7. **Histoplasmosis** - Less likely without travel history and typical presentation patterns.
8. **Bronchogenic Cyst** - Fits the location but unlikely to present with all mentioned systemic signs and size.
9. **Mediastinal Abscess** - Typically presents more acutely with signs of infection, less likely.
10. **Chronic Pulmonary Embolism** - Unlikely given the nature of the mass and systemic symptoms.","['Adolescent Medicine', 'Pediatrics', 'Hematologic Cancer', 'Lymphomas', 'Hematology']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,18.0,M
