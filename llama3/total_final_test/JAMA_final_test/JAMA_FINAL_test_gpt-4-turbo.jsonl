He had no known ocular history. At presentation, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/100 OD and 20/50 OS. Intraocular pressures were normal bilaterally and pupils were equally reactive. Examination of the right eye was unremarkable except for moderate cataract. The left-eye slitlamp examination was remarkable for a shallow but quiet anterior chamber and moderate cataract. Dilated fundus examination of the left eye revealed shallow peripheral serous choroidal detachments, bullous inferior macula-involving retinal detachment with shifting fluid, and diffuse hyperpigmented lesions involving the macula and superior fundus that corresponded to areas of nodular retinal pigment epithelium thickening on optical coherence tomography (Figure 1). These hyperpigmented lesions were associated with hyperautofluorescence and blockage on fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography. No retinal breaks were seen on scleral depressed examination. Ultrasound biomicroscopy demonstrated 360° ciliochoroidal effusion. Axial length was 24.30 mm OD and 24.32 mm OS.

The patient noted blurry vision started around the time of cabozantinib therapy initiation. Cabozantinib therapy was discontinued for surgery and resumed 3 days later. The referring retina specialist noted vitritis and vasculitis intraoperatively, but the result of vitreous biopsy cytology was negative for malignant cells. At presentation to our institution, the patient was taking oral prednisone, 40 mg/d. His visual acuity was 20/500 OD and hand motions OS, with an intraocular pressure of 18 mm Hg in both eyes. Right eye slitlamp examination results showed pigmented cells in the anterior chamber and lens capsule; the left eye showed prolapsed pigmented vitreous at the pupillary margin. Right eye fundus examination results revealed sheets of pigmented cell and vascular sheathing with optic nerve pallor. The left eye had a poor view, with 90% gas fill. Fluorescein angiography illustrated disc and vessel leakage (predominantly arteriole), capillary dropout, and peripheral nonperfusion in the right eye (Figure 1A) with no view in the left eye.

She had received her medical care at outside facilities, the records of which were not available. She could not recall being given any precise diagnosis but reported having proteinuria since age 7 years. Her other medical conditions included hyperlipidemia, arterial hypertension, and pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex infection. She was taking tacrolimus, amlodipine, atorvastatin, ethambutol, rifampin, and clarithromycin. Her family history was unremarkable. She had 2 healthy adult children. One year after the first kidney transplant, she noted an inferior visual field defect in the left eye and was diagnosed with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Several years later, she underwent uncomplicated bilateral cataract procedures. Visual acuity with distance correction was 20/25 OD and 20/30 OS. Color vision was 14/14 plates for each eye. There was a left relative afferent pupillary defect. Confrontation visual field was full for the right eye and demonstrated an inferior defect for the left eye. External and slitlamp examinations were notable only for bilateral pseudophakia. Both optic discs were anomalous in appearance, with central excavation in the left eye greater than the right eye (Figure). The remainder of the posterior pole examination, including the retinal vessels, appeared normal in both eyes. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Papillorenal syndrome due to a PAX2 gene variant", "predict": "**Step 1: Nonarteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION)**", "topic": "['Chronic Kidney Disease', 'Surgery', 'Transplantation', 'Renal Replacement', 'Nephrology']"}

Five months after surgery, he presented to the otolaryngology clinic with 3 weeks of mild odynophagia and dysphagia. It was noted that the patient had a prominent posterior pharyngeal wall, subtle asymmetry of vocal fold motion, and pooling of secretions in the left pyriform (Video 1). During the next 6 months, he gradually developed shortness of breath and stridor, and eventually presented to the emergency department in respiratory distress requiring intubation for 2 days. Shortly after extubation, laryngeal examination showed fullness of the posterior pharyngeal wall and severely limited vocal fold abduction bilaterally (Figure 1A; Video 1). A modified barium swallow study showed intermittent laryngeal penetration without aspiration (Video 2). Although the patient was unable to tolerate magnetic resonance imaging, a soft tissue computed tomography scan of the neck with contrast revealed a well-positioned plate with no evidence of fluid collection in the setting of a normal leukocyte count. One month later, a neuromuscular specialist investigated potential underlying neurological causes; however, results of nerve conduction, antiacetylcholine receptor, antimuscle-specific kinase, methylmalonic acid, HIV, rapid plasma reagin, vitamin B-12, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroxine, copper, creatine kinase, and immunofixation studies were all unremarkable. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Delayed iatrogenic bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP)", "predict": "### Step 1: Differential Diagnosis\n1. **Post-surgical complication (related to neck surgery)**\n\n### Step 2: Differential Diagnosis \n2. **Thyroid disorder**\n\n### Step 3: Differential Diagnosis\n3. **Laryngeal cancer**\n\n### Step 4: Differential Diagnosis\n4. **Cervical spondylosis progression**\n\n### Step 5: Differential Diagnosis\n5. **Myasthenia gravis**\n\n### Step 6: Differential Diagnosis\n6. **Infectious etiology (such as a viral or bacterial pharyngitis)**\n\n### Step 7: Differential Diagnosis \n7. **Stroke affecting the brainstem**\n\n### Step 8: Differential Diagnosis\n8. **Motor neuron disease (e.g., ALS)**\n\n### Step 9: Differential Diagnosis\n9. **Rheumatologic disease impacting the cervical spine**\n\n### Step 10: Differential Diagnosis\n10. **Cervical spine osteoarthritis**\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnosis Using All Patient Information and Test Results\n1. **Post-surgical complication (related to neck surgery)** - Given the temporal relation of symptoms to the surgery, including dysphagia and vocal fold abnormalities soon after surgery, this is a likely cause.\n2. **Cervical spondylosis progression** - Patient originally underwent surgery for cervical spondylotic myelopathy; progression could explain new or persistent symptoms.\n3. **Myasthenia gravis** - Initially likely due to symptoms of voice change and swallowing difficulty, but less likely given negative neuromuscular workup.\n4. **Stroke affecting the brainstem** - Unlikely due to persistent and gradually worsening symptoms without acute onset, but could be considered given the symptoms affecting cranial nerve-served areas.\n5. **Motor neuron disease (e.g., ALS)** - Symptoms of progressive bulbar palsy could fit, but less likely without other motor symptoms or findings on neurological evaluation.\n6. **Laryngeal cancer** -Possible given the presenting symptoms of odynophagia and vocal fold asymmetry, though no masses were noted on imaging.\n7. **Thyroid disorder** - Thyroid dysfunction can lead to bilateral vocal fold paralysis; however, relevant tests were unremarkable.\n8. **Infectious etiology (such as a viral or bacterial pharyngitis)** - Would have acute rather than progressive course.\n9. **Rheumatologic disease impacting the cervical spine** - Potential to cause similar symptoms but nothing indicative on lab work or history.\n10. **Cervical spine osteoarthritis** - This could potentially exacerbate pre-existing pain, but would unlikely cause such severe dysphagia or respiratory distress on its own.\n\nThis protocol and remarried list consider the temporal relationship to recent surgery as a primary driver of symptoms, while not entirely dismissing possibilities of progression of primary disease or new issues related to other systems.", "topic": "['Laryngology', 'Neurosurgery', 'Otolaryngology', 'Health Care Safety', 'Surgery']"}

The recurrence, the type of lesions described, and the direct identification of Candida albicans from lesion cultures support this diagnosis.\n\n2. **Tinea Unguium (Onychomycosis)** - Thickened and yellowed toenails, along with the positive fungal elements found on KOH preparation, make this an important differential to consider, likely as a component of the broader diagnosis of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.\n\n3. **Psoriasis** - While the clinical features can resemble psoriasis, especially with the presence of scaly plaques on feet, the recurrence pattern and successful treatment with antifungals are unusual for psoriasis, making this less likely.\n\n4. **Atopic Dermatitis** - The chronicity and involvement of the skin suggest this, but the definitive response to antifungal therapy and fungal identification point away from this diagnosis.\n\n5. **Lichen Planus** - The oral plaques might suggest lichen planus, but other clinical features and recurrence pattern after stopping antifungals do not support this diagnosis.\n\n6. **Immunodeficiency Disorders** - Normal immunoglobulin levels and T-cell subset analysis are reassuring, but immunodeficiency was considered given the recurrent and severe nature of infections.\n\n7. **Pityriasis Versicolor** - Pityriasis versicolor usually does not affect nails or the oral mucosa and typically does not present with the type of lesions described.\n\n8. **Contact Dermatitis** - The recurrent nature and specific sites of involvement (oral mucosa, toenails) are not typical for contact dermatitis.\n\n9. **Seborrheic Dermatitis** - Lacks the nail involvement and pattern of recurrence seen in this case. \n\n10. **Alopecia Areata** - Does not really align with the skin findings or recurrent fungal infections, making it the least likely diagnosis.\n\nChronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis remains the top diagnosis on review, with other diagnoses being considerations for symptomatic manifestations of the primary disease.

On physical examination, there was a nontender 4-cm mass in the left submandibular region with no overlying skin changes. Ultrasonography results showed an avascular cystic structure with internal debris and a single thin septation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the neck soft tissue revealed a 3-cm low attenuation, nonenhancing, cystic-appearing mass that elevated the submandibular gland to the level of the parapharyngeal fat space with medial extension of the lesion into the tongue musculature. The walls were thin except for mildly thickened capsule along the posterior aspect of the lesion (Figure, A and B). Fluid that aspirated from the cyst was serous, and cytology showed mature and anucleate squamous cells with acute inflammation. The mass returned after 3 weeks. Further analysis 8 months after the initial CT via contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a large, multiseptated cystic structure (Figure, C); the capsule of the wall was mildly thickened and was contrast enhancing. At age 12 months, the mass was excised via neck dissection. A lateral component at the level of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was completely excised.

Despite 3 days of treatment with an oral antibiotic (cefalexin), her thigh pain and swelling did not improve, and she was readmitted to the hospital and intravenous clindamycin was started. Wound cultures and blood cultures obtained during incision and drainage performed on hospital day 1 were negative for bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal organisms. The following day, her temperature was 39.4 °C (102.9 °F), blood pressure was 86/42 mm Hg, and heart rate was 131/min. She was transferred to the intensive care unit for presumed septic shock, and her antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and meropenem. Surgical debridement of the right thigh was performed on hospital day 3. On hospital day 4, a new purple dusky border developed along the wound edge, and the patent underwent a second surgical debridement. After debridement on hospital day 5, her temperature was 39.8 °C (103.6 °F), and she required vasopressor infusion with norepinephrine for shock. Her right thigh had a deep 9 × 8–cm ulcer with a dusky violaceous border extending 2 to 5 cm from the wound edge (Figure, left), with many 1- to 2-mm pustules (not visible in Figure). Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 30 000/μL (88% neutrophils); lactate level, 77.5 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L); and procalcitonin level, 16.1 ng/mL (reference, <0.1 ng/mL). Histologic examination of the tissue obtained during the second surgical debridement revealed ulceration with extensive neutrophilic inflammation (Figure, right).

Four weeks following receipt of immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab, he developed acute abdominal pain in the setting of a rapidly rising lactic acid dehydrogenase levels, prompting hospital admission. Imaging results showed mild disease progression (new ascites and periportal metabolic lymph node). Splenic infarct and portal/splenic vein thrombi were identified as etiologies of his acute pain and were presumed to be secondary to hypercoagulable state of malignancy. Over the next 3 days, he had rising serum creatinine (sCr) levels (baseline, approximately 1 mg/dL [to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4]). The initial workup included ultrasonography and urinalysis. Ultrasonography results showed abnormal intraparenchymal flow to both kidneys without evidence of kidney artery stenosis. Urine studies were consistent with prerenal etiology, while the presence of casts suggested acute tubular necrosis. Nephrotoxic medications (omeprazole/pantoprazole) were discontinued. The top differential diagnoses at this juncture included contrast-induced nephropathy or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)–induced acute interstitial nephritis, and empirical high dose steroids were prescribed. Despite observation and steroid treatment, his sCr levels continued to increase over the next 5 days, peaking at 5.8 mg/dL, and the patient progressed into anuric kidney failure, requiring hemodialysis.

One year later, the patient underwent excision of a right iliac wing lesion, and pathologic findings demonstrated xanthoma of bone with sclerosis. Three years after this second surgery, she presented with new abdominal pain. Results of CT imaging revealed a 4.3-cm retrocaval mass at the level of the renal right vein. She underwent surgical resection, and results of pathologic evaluation were consistent with the original tumor. Follow-up CT imaging revealed a 1.2-cm left upper lobe lung nodule and a 0.8-cm right upper lobe lung nodule, as well as a pulmonary embolism and a left 6th rib fracture.

She denied ocular disease, trauma, or surgery. She had no medical problems aside from chronic back pain due to a herniated disc. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure, extraocular motility, and pupillary examination results were normal. The right eye was unremarkable. Examination of the left eye showed 2 temporal scleral nodules with surrounding hyperemia and no scleromalacia. She experienced substantial pain with palpation. Posterior examination results were unremarkable. The results of the following laboratory tests were all unremarkable: tuberculosis interferon-γ release assay, rapid plasma reagin, fluorescent treponemal antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. The rheumatoid factor level (18 IU/mL [normal range, <14 IU/mL]) and C-reactive protein level (26 mg/L [normal range, 0-5 mg/L]) were elevated. In addition, Lyme IgG, IgM, and reflex Western blot assays were positive for antibodies. The patient denied travel to Lyme-endemic regions, tick bites, or rashes. The patient started oral prednisone therapy for possible rheumatoid arthritis (RA)–associated nodular scleritis, doxycycline therapy for positive Lyme studies, and was referred to a rheumatologist for further RA evaluation. Two weeks after presentation and initiation of oral prednisone therapy, the patient noted improvement in pain, but the scleral nodules and hyperemia persisted. Therefore, subconjunctival triamcinolone acetonide (0.5 mL of 40 mg/mL) was administered to the left eye. Further confirmatory RA workup by rheumatology did not reveal other systemic findings thought to be associated with RA on review of symptoms or clinical examination.

The continued symptoms could be attributed to a severe or biphasic reaction.\n\n2. **Cold Urticaria** - The exposure to cold triggering hives and possible systemic reactions fits this diagnosis. This condition could potentially lead to anaphylaxis.\n\n3. **Acute Coronary Syndrome** - The development of chest pain and persistent hypotension after the administration of epinephrine raises concerns about possible acute cardiac issues, especially in the response of a young patient to such acute stress.\n\n4. **Cardiac Ischemia** - Considering the risk of epinephrine on increasing myocardial oxygen demand which can expose unrecognized coronary artery disease or vasospasm leading to ischemia.\n\n5. **Pulmonary Embolism** - The symptoms of respiratory distress and presence of wheezing (which can also manifest in acute PE due to pulmonary infarction), alongside tachycardia and hypotension, make this a possible although less likely consideration.\n\n6. **Asthma Exacerbation** - Given the wheezing and respiratory distress, a severe asthma attack could be considered, but usually would not cause systemic hypotension without a significant component like anaphylaxis.\n\n7. **Myocarditis** - While myocarditis can present with varied symptoms including chest pain and wheezing due to cardiac output issues, the acuteness and setting suggest other diagnoses are more likely.\n\n8. **Pheochromocytoma** - Though rare and less likely to present acutely, the symptoms particularly after administration of epinephrine can mimic those seen in diseases with excessive catecholamine release.\n\n9. **Vasovagal Syncope** - Typically a benign cause of presyncope and nausea, the severe presentation here makes this less likely, although the initial trigger was likely a stress response.\n\n10. **Hypovolemic Shock** - Although the symptoms are somewhat consistent with shock states, the primary absence of significant fluid losses makes this the least likely among the listed differentials.\n\nThe priority in managing this case would involve further stabilizing the patient hemodynamically, continuously monitoring heart rhythms, and possibly blood tests and imaging to confirm the primary diagnosis and exclude other serious conditions like Acute Coronary Syndrome or Pulmonary Embolism.", "topic": "['Cardiology', 'Pain Medicine', 'Allergy and Clinical Immunology', 'Dermatology']"}

A smaller satellite lesion with a similar MRI profile was noted inferiorly in the right anterior temporal lobe. A computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not show any metastatic disease. A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile showed a normal red blood cell count and protein and glucose levels and a mildly elevated white blood cell count of 11 cells/μL (to convert to cells × 109/L, multiply by 0.001).

His medical history was significant for several episodes of upper respiratory infection during the previous winter season, and he previously had an adenotonsillectomy several years prior and bilateral ear tubes placed 1 year before presentation. Physical examination showed a mildly tender, nonmobile, left parotid mass near the angle of the mandible with no overlying skin changes or drainage around the mass. There was no lymphadenopathy or other lesions noted in the neck area, and cranial nerve VII was fully intact. Ultrasonography results of the neck showed a left 1.5-cm preauricular nodular mass with internal and marginal vascularity. A neck magnetic resonance imaging study without contrast performed at an outside institution revealed the 1.5-cm heterogeneous intraparotid nodule that was predominantly isotense to glandular tissue on T1 images with vague hypointensity of a small irregular central region, as well as vague hyperintensity on T2 images. He subsequently underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy to assess the lesion, which demonstrated benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells. The mass was continuing to enlarge, and the patient’s pain was increasing in that area, so the decision was made to perform left superficial parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve.

Two years prior, he was diagnosed with a right lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolism on a computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram after evaluation of shortness of breath. Warfarin was initiated but discontinued after 2 months due to recurrent epistaxis. On presentation to the pulmonary clinic, the patient reported dyspnea with minimal activity, fatigue, lightheadedness, and leg swelling. His temperature was 96.8 °F (36 °C); blood pressure, 120/71 mm Hg; heart rate, 73/min; and oxygen saturation, 98% on room air.

Four years earlier, he started taking lenalidomide, 10 mg/d (28-day cycle), to treat worsening anemia; after 2 cycles of treatment, he became transfusion independent. Since then, he has remained stable with the same dose and schedule of lenalidomide without significant adverse effects. The presenting skin lesions developed 1 month before presentation and began as small pustules that rapidly transformed into painful ulcers. He was treated with valacyclovir for a presumed diagnosis of shingles, but the lesions did not improve. Because of suspected necrotizing fasciitis, he underwent incision and drainage of the lesions. Cultures from the surgical specimen grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus. However, the lesions continued to worsen despite vancomycin and additional debridement. Thus, he was transferred to our facility. Physical examination showed multiple cutaneous ulcers with gray undermined borders and red papules of varying depths involving the chest, back, and upper extremity; lesions were as large as 9 × 15 cm. A complete blood cell count showed a white blood cell count of 16.2 × 103/μL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 1.0) with an absolute neutrophil count of 12.7 × 103/μL, hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), and platelet count of 262 × 103/μL with no circulating blasts. Results of additional laboratory studies, including blood culture and tests for herpes zoster virus (via polymerase chain reaction), antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were all negative. Additionally, the patient also had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for which he was taking lisinopril and simvastatin, respectively. Pathologic sampling from skin lesions demonstrated a dense dermal infiltrate with predominantly neutrophils along with reactive histiocytes, fibroblasts, and angioplasia (Figure, A). Immunohistochemical staining showed myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils (Figure, B), histiocytic markers (CD43, CD63, CD168), and CD117-positive mast cells, but no immature myeloid precursors.

During the procedure, a clear liquid pulsating from the middle ear was noted, and samples were sent for β-2-transferrine analysis. This confirmed the presence of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. The patient was referred to our tertiary referral center hospital. The leak settled with conservative management, and imaging of the brain and skull base was performed. A high-resolution computed tomography scan of the temporal bone showed a lytic aspect of the right temporal bone extending to the petrous apex and the petrous bone, sparing the otic capsule (Figure 1A). There was soft tissue opacification of the right mastoid air cells. Magnetic resonance imaging of the skull base with contrast was performed (Figure 1B). It showed a hyperintense T2 signal in the petrous apex and mastoid air cells. There was a suspected communication into the soft tissues of the right neck in the posterior triangle.

Her symptoms were initially most prominent while playing sports and were suspected to be due to asthma or seasonal allergies. However, medical management with albuterol, intranasal fluticasone, and cetirizine failed to provide relief. More recently, the patient’s parents noted that she developed stridor while sleeping and while at rest, prompting the family to present for medical attention. Previous workup, including pulmonary function testing, was concerning for an upper airway obstructive process, for which she was referred to otolaryngology. In-office flexible videostroboscopy revealed a mass in the distal cervical trachea that appeared nearly obstructive. Chest radiography confirmed the presence of an approximately 1.5-cm, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass within the cervical trachea. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. This demonstrated an exophytic, pedunculated mass that emanated from the anterior wall of the cervical trachea (Figure 1A and B). The patient was intubated via Seldinger technique to bypass the mass, with a 4.0-mm cuffed endotracheal tube loaded over a 0-degree Hopkins endoscope (Figure 1C). With the airway secured, attention was turned to excision of the mass.

Seven years before this visit, he underwent a reduced-intensity, matched, unrelated donor, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). His post-transplant course was complicated by severe chronic graft vs host disease of the skin, eyes, and gut, for which he received systemic corticosteroid therapy, tacrolimus, methotrexate, and long-term extracorporeal photopheresis. Three years after the HSCT, he developed chronic ulcerations on the hips, back, and arms at the site of previously irradiated tumors, as well as multiple friable, hemorrhagic, and bleeding nodules on bilateral hips and his forearms while receiving treatment with corticosteroids and extracorporeal photopheresis. He underwent several debulking procedures and excision biopsies of the nodules, which revealed granulation tissue on histology. In this latest visit, physical examination revealed recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on his left lateral hip and left lateral buttock (Figure 1). Similar nodules were noted on his right hip and forearm. The patient underwent repeated debulking and biopsy. He was also treated with micafungin, amphotericin B, levofloxacin, dapsone, acyclovir, pentamidine, penicillin VK, and posaconazole.

Topical timolol was tried without improvement; oral prednisolone decreased the size of the lesion, but was poorly tolerated and discontinued. An ophthalmic evaluation at an outside hospital was concerning for amblyopia because of anisohypermetropia, greater on the left, and a left esotropia and hypertropia. A magnetic resonance image revealed an orbital mass surrounding the left lateral rectus muscle with mass effect on the globe and extension into the eyelid, pterygopalatine fossa, and cheek. Given the risk of amblyopia, the patient underwent 2 embolization and debulking procedures of the orbital and cheek components of the lesion, which were positive for glucose transporter 1 on pathology. However, the esotropia abruptly worsened after the second debulking. At age 3 years, he presented to the clinic with a persistent cheek and orbit lesion, dense amblyopia, large-angle monocular esotropia and hypertropia, and proptosis of the left eye. The left extraocular muscle showed inability to abduct past midline (Figure 1A). A repeated magnetic resonance image showed persistent orbital involvement causing medial displacement of the lateral rectus muscle and mass effect on the globe (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Infantile hemangioma", "predict": "### Step 1: Initial Differential Diagnosis\n\n1. **Capillary Hemangioma** - Early presentation fits with diagnosis especially given the evolution from a pink macule which then became raised and discolored.\n\n### Step 2: Reevaluation and Expanded Differential\n\n2. **Infantile Hemangioma** - Given the growth despite medical treatment, this remains a plausible initial consideration different to capillary type by its rapid growth phase in infancy.\n\n### Step 3: Considering Complications or Alternate Diagnoses\n\n3. **Orbital Lymphangioma** - The persistent growth and involvement of deeper structures suggest considering a lymphatic component.\n\n### Step 4: Examining Pathologies with Glucose Transporter 1 Association\n\n4. **Infantile Fibrosarcoma** - Pathology's mention of glucose transporter-1 positive cells prompts consideration of tumors with known GLUT1 expression.\n\n### Step 5: Taking Glucose Transporter 1 Further into Account\n\n5. **Port-Wine Stain (as part of Sturge-Weber Syndrome)** - Typically marked by a port-wine stain and neurological abnormalities, relevant given GLUT1, though usually not presenting so dramatically in orbit.\n\n### Step 6: Considering Aggressive/Vascular Nature of Lesion\n\n6. **Kaposiform Hemangioendothelioma** - A rare vascular tumor known for being aggressive and often resistant to treatment, matches progression despite aggressive management.\n\n### Step 7: Considering the Impact on Eye Movement and Eye Structure\n\n7. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** - A malignancy that can affect the muscles around the eye, explaining worsening esotropia and displacement of eye muscle.\n\n### Step 8: Impact of Therapy and Anisohypermetropia Connection\n\n8. **Venous Lymphatic Malformation** - These can present with complex, diffuse swelling and progress despite treatment, affecting vision by displacing ocular structures.\n\n### Step 9: Examining Location-Specific Tumors\n\n9. **Optic Nerve Glioma** - Tumors affecting the optic pathway causing disfiguration and displacement as seen in MR images.\n\n### Step 10: Combining Presentation with Rare Possibilities\n\n10. **Neurofibromatosis**(Type 1) - Although less likely, it presents a variety of symptoms including tumors along nerves, optic pathway gliomas and skin abnormalities.\n\n### Reevaluation and Reranking Based on Complete Clinical and Pathological Information:\n1. **Infantile Hemangioma**\n2. **Capillary Hemangioma**\n3. **Kaposiform Hemangioendothelioma**\n4. **Orbital Lymphangioma**\n5. **Rhabdomyosarcoma**\n6. **Venous Lymphatic Malformation**\n7. **Infantile Fibrosarcoma**\n8. **Optic Nerve Glioma**\n9. **Port-Wine Stain (Sturge-Weber Syndrome)**\n10. **Neurofibromatosis** (Type 1)\n\nThis reordered list prioritizes diagnoses based on persistence, aggressive nature, noticeable orbital effect, and resistance to treatment, aligning with available pathology and imaging findings.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the right eye disclosed a central PED with SRF that extended beyond the inferior border of the PED (Figure, A). Hyperreflective foci, suggestive of vitelliform material, were visible on the photoreceptors. OCT in the left eye demonstrated 2 PEDs in the parafovea (Figure, B). SRF was present with overlying thickening of the photoreceptors. The choroid was thin in each eye. Fluorescein angiography revealed punctate hyperfluorescent staining within the body of the PEDs in each eye. There was no evidence of leakage in either eye. Fundus autofluorescence displayed dispersed, speckled hyperautofluorescence corresponding to the potential vitelliform material and SRF in the right eye.

At age 23 years, he had bilateral cataract surgery, and over the last 2 years, he developed worsening stiffness and walking difficulties with frequent falls. He reported features of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome (RLS), visual daytime hallucinations, and rapid cognitive decline. He was given levodopa/benserazide (up to 200 mg/50 mg 4 times daily) without improvement on his Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale scores. Therefore, his dopaminergic medication was ceased. Family history was negative for movement or developmental disorders. His neurologic examination showed hypomimia, symmetrical bradykinesia, and rigidity of the extremities without tremors (Video).

However, the lack of additional sensory or motor symptoms usually seen in MS makes this less likely than some other causes.\n\n5. **Cerebral aneurysm** - Though it could explain sudden onset of severe headache and possibly neurological deficits from pressure or rupture, the absence of other symptoms typical of aneurysm rupture (such as photophobia, neck stiffness) makes this less likely.\n\n6. **Myasthenia gravis** - Possible, as it can present with ocular symptoms like binocular diplopia, although other common symptoms of MG like general muscle weakness are not mentioned.\n\n7. **Vasculitis** - Could potentially cause neurological symptoms including those affecting vision due to inflammation of blood vessels in the brain.

Results of a computed tomographic (CT) scan showed an ill-defined soft tissue mass, which was likely nodal disease, at the left supraclavicular (Figure 1), as well as the prevertebral and paravertebral region, which partially encased the left common carotid, left subclavian, and left vertebral arteries.

Emergency department evaluation noted a heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 173/90 mm Hg, and a temperature of 37.1 °C. An electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm with complete heart block (CHB) and a narrow QRS junctional escape at 65 beats per minute (Figure, A). Investigation revealed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 30 mm/h (normal limits, 0-15 mm/h) and a C-reactive protein level of 6.3 mg/dL (reference range, 0.0-1.0 mg/dL [to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10.0]). Tests for kidney function, hepatic function, a complete blood cell count, troponin T levels, creatine kinase levels, thyrotropin levels, antinuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor had normal results, and tests for anti–streptolysin O and anti–DNAse B titers, Lyme IgG and IgM titers, Coxiella burnetti and Bartonella serologies, Epstein-Barr virus serology, and cytomegalovirus quantification had negative results. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no structural abnormalities, while fluorine 18–labeledfluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG-PET–CT) showed a small focal area of FDG uptake in the region of the membranous septum (Figure, B). Systemic FDG uptake was absent. A CT showed no hilar adenopathy or pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities. Over the next 48 hours, the patient’s junctional rhythm accelerated to 90 beats per minute with ventriculoatrial block before acutely degenerating to a narrow complex escape rhythm of 45 beats per minutes associated with lightheadedness (Figure, C). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Viral myocarditis", "predict": "### Step 1: Myocarditis\n- **Reasoning:** The patient's history of recent fever, myalgias, and respiratory symptoms, followed by symptoms indicative of cardiac involvement such as palpitations and dyspnea on exertion, suggests myocarditis. This condition can also lead to CHB as seen on the ECG. Elevated inflammatory markers like ESR and CRP further support this possibility.\n\n### Step 2: Lyme Disease\n- **Reasoning:** Given the complete heart block and systemic symptoms, Lyme disease could be a consideration, particularly if the patient has had potential tick exposures. Lyme carditis can present with similar cardiac electrical disturbances. However, this is less likely given negative Lyme serologies.\n\n### Step 3: Sarcoidosis\n- **Reasoning:** Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease that can affect the heart and manifest as heart block. The fact that FDG-PET–CT shows localized FDG uptake in the septal region could suggest granulomatous activity, although no hilar adenopathy or pulmonary findings typically associated with sarcoidosis were reported.\n\n### Step 4: Giant Cell Myocarditis\n- **Reasoning:** A more aggressive form of myocarditis that could rapidly progress and present with heart block. It is typically associated with severe cardiac dysfunction, but initial echocardiography showed no structural abnormalities in this case.\n\n### Step 5: Cardiac Tumor\n- **Reasoning:** A primary cardiac tumor, or metastasis, might cause localized FDG uptake and could potentially lead to electrical conduction disturbances including complete heart block.\n\n### Step 6: Rheumatic Fever\n- **Reasoning:** While more common in children, rheumatic fever could follow pharyngitis and lead to myocardial involvement. However, the absence of valvular abnormalities and negative anti-streptolysin O and anti-DNAse B titers makes this diagnosis less likely.\n\n### Step 7: Lupus\n- **Reasoning:** Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) could cause myocarditis and other cardiac involvements such as heart block. But normal ANA and rheumatoid factor tests make lupus less likely.\n\n### Step 8: Chagas Disease\n- **Reasoning:** Chagas disease can lead to cardiac abnormalities including heart block. It's more prevalent in Central and South America but should be considered depending on the patient’s travel or residency history.\n\n### Step 9: Cardiac Amyloidosis\n- **Reasoning:** This typically presents in older adults, but if present can involve the conduction system and lead to heart block. Lack of other typical signs like proteinuria, and echocardiographic findings of infiltrative cardiomyopathy minimizes likelihood.\n\n### Step 10: Infective Endocarditis\n- **Reasoning:** While infective endocarditis can lead to heart block, especially if involving the aortic valve, the absence of valvular lesions on echocardiogram and negative systemic infection signs (other than elevated ESR/CRP) make this less likely.\n\n### Reranked Differential Diagnosis:\n1. **Myocarditis** – Strongest diagnosis given recent symptomatic profile, ECG changes, and FDG-PET findings.\n2. **Sarcoidosis** – Possible, considering localized FDG uptake, although typical pulmonary involvement is absent.\n3. **Giant Cell Myocarditis** – Less likely than typical myocarditis due to lack of severe echocardiographic abnormalities, but possible given the rapid deterioration.\n4. **Cardiac Tumor** – Localized FDG uptake might hint at this, requiring further investigation.\n5. **Lyme Disease** – Negative serologies make this less likely but was initially considered due to symptom profile and heart block.\n6. **Rheumatic Fever** – Lower likelihood due to negative serological tests and missing typical manifestations.\n7. **Lupus** – Unlikely due to negative specific autoantibodies but considered due to cardiac involvement.\n8. **Chagas Disease** – Considered based on clinical presentation, though epidemiological likelihood is low.\n9. **Cardiac Amyloidosis** – Unlikely in a young patient without typical features of infiltrative disease.\n10. **Infective Endocarditis** – Least likely given the clinical and echocardiographic findings presented.\n\nThis reevaluation considers the clinical presentation, test results, and commonality of the conditions in the differential diagnosis.", "topic": "['Cardiology', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Rhythm Disorders']"}

Clinical examination revealed 180° of left interior subconjunctival hemorrhage with overlying conjunctival elevation and mild fullness of the left lower eyelid (Figure 1A). Fixation was central, steady, and maintained bilaterally, with full ocular motility and absence of appreciable proptosis. Penlight anterior segment examination demonstrated normally formed anterior segment structures without inflammation or hyphema in either eye, although the left eye exhibited a small intraocular lightly pigmented lesion at the 5-o'clock limbus.

The lesions initially started over the trunk and subsequently progressed to involve the face, hands, and feet. The episodes of skin blisters were accompanied by pruritus and redness all over the body. There was no history of oral erosions or difficulty in feeding. Bowel and bladder movements were normal. The child had an older sibling who had no skin ailments, and none of the other family members were affected. On examination, multiple tense, angulated vesicles and bullae on a background of erythema were seen over the face, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A and B). Few urticated papules and wheals were seen in isolation over the trunk. The ruptured bullae were healing with hypopigmentation with accompanying scarring and discrete milia formation. The mucosae and nails were normal. No contractures or webbing of fingers was noted. There was no organomegaly.

Epidermolysis bullosa - Presence of tense, angulated vesicles and bullae, pruritus, redness, scarring, hypopigmentation, and milia formation clearly point towards genetic causes seen in epidermolysis bullosa.\n2. Bullous pemphigoid - Characterized by tense blisters, typically in infants and older adults, but less common than epidermolysis bullosa in infants without history of drug intake or other underlying disease.\n3. Linear IgA bullous dermatosis - Considering the distribution and type of lesions, this can be a differential, more so if biopsy shows linear IgA deposition at the basement membrane.\n4. Pemphigus vulgaris - Less likely in infants and typically involves mucosal areas, which are not affected in this case.\n5. Bullous impetigo - Needs to be considered because of the recurrent blisters, but presence of milia and scarring are less typical.\n6. Dermatitis herpetiformis - It often comes with intense itching and a rash in older children and adults, and less common in infants.\n7. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) - Typical for infants and young children but usually presents with more widespread erythema and skin sloughing.\n8. Erythema multiforme - Consists of target lesions, often triggered by infection or medications, not fitting well with current symptomatology.\n9. Incontinentia pigmenti - Typically seen in females due to lethal effect in males when X-linked dominant, less consistent without characteristic early vesicular stage that progresses to verrucous, and then hyperpigmented stages.\n10. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection - HSV should be considered because of the vesicular nature of the rash, though systemic signs and the chronic, progressive nature in this case make it less likely.\n\nThe most prioritized diagnosis based on the current clinical presentation and findings would be epidermolysis bullosa, and further confirmatory genetic testing or advanced immunofluorescence studies could be considered to support this diagnosis.", "topic": "['Allergy and Clinical Immunology', 'Pediatrics', 'Dermatology']"}

When emergency responders arrived, the patient was responsive but groggy. An electrocardiogram (ECG) in the field demonstrated a regular wide complex tachycardia. En route to the hospital, 6 mg of adenosine followed by 12 mg of adenosine were administered intravenously, without a change in her rhythm. On arrival to the emergency department, she was in a regular wide complex tachycardia with a heart rate of 225 beats per minute (Figure, A), with an initial blood pressure of 108/77 mm Hg. She was oriented but slow to respond. After sedation, a synchronized, biphasic, 200-J shock converted her to sinus rhythm with bigeminy (Figure, B), which settled to normal sinus rhythm.

The patient had a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome with insulin resistance and a migraine disorder and reported experiencing 1 to 2 migraine episodes per week since early high school. She believed that the neck mass made these episodes worse than normal. The patient was otherwise previously healthy until she developed an upper respiratory infection. Her physician noted visible swelling in the right neck and clinically interpreted the finding as enlarged lymph nodes associated with the infection. After 2 weeks, the neck swelling persisted despite the resolution of other symptoms. She was subsequently treated with a course of antibiotics, which did not result in any improvement. The mass slowly enlarged over the next 6 months. The patient reported new symptoms, including waxing and waning pain that radiated to the back of her neck, headaches, and intermittent dysphagia. She also noted periods during which the mass would fluctuate in size. Otolaryngologic examination findings were within normal limits except for a single, nontender, compressible right neck mass deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and extending into level V. The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan prior to presentation at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center’s otolaryngology clinic. The scan showed a fatty-appearing tumor within the right carotid space. The patient underwent surgical excision, and a mass measuring 8.0 × 6.5 × 4.7–cm was removed from the carotid space (Figure, A). Additional material from the mass was excised at the level of the base of the skull. Gross pathologic examination demonstrated yellowish-brown, homogenous, lobular adipose tissue covered by a thin, tan, transparent membrane (Figure, A). Histopathologic examination showed relatively uniform univacuolar and multivacuolated, granular eosinophilic cells with centrally placed nucleoli (Figure, B and C).

This finding is consistent with the gross examination of the mass as yellowish-brown, homogenous, lobular adipose tissue.\n\n- **Neurofibroma**: Although less likely given the characteristics of the tumor described, neurofibroma could present as a neck mass, but usually features nerve bundle infiltration, which was not indicated in the histopathological findings.\n\n- **Branchial Cleft Cyst**: This differential is considered due to its common location in the lateral aspect of the neck, but the cystic component typically expected in BC cysts was not described.\n\n- **Lymphadenopathy**: Initially suspected by her physician as an enlarged lymph node associated with infection, but the benign lymph nodes and the nature of the mass do not support this.\n\n- **Carotid Body Tumor**: Location in the carotid space could suggest this, but the histology and fatty nature of the mass make it less likely.\n\n- **Cystic Hygroma**: Typically presents earlier in life and commonly has a multiloculated appearance on imaging, which was not described here.\n\n- **Lymphoma**: Typically would not present as a fatty tumor, and the histological appearance of the excised tissue does not support this.\n\n- **Thyroid Nodule**: This diagnosis is less likely considering the mass's location relative to the thyroid and the lack of related findings in histopathology.\n\n- **Metastatic Carcinoma**: Given the lack of primary known malignancy and typical presentation, along with histopathological findings, this would be lower on the differential list.\n\n- **Migraine**: Mentioned by the patient as possibly exacerbated by the mass, but it is a separate condition not related directly to the physical characteristics of the neck mass.\n\nThis reranking places a greater emphasis on diagnosing based on the imaging and histopathological findings, suggesting that a lipoma is the primary diagnosis, with other considerations being less likely based on the evidence.", "topic": "['Otolaryngology']"}

Her mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of her father. After a period living alone, she had returned to the family home 4 months prior to her presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. Her family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. Her family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to herself, expressing concerns about people meaning her harm, and professing the belief that she could hear other peoples’ thoughts. The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with her family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, her family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, she had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. She left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. She left this job about a year prior to her referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of her father. She was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness. On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and she presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. Her speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. She denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding her neighbors. She reflected that over the preceding few months, she had experienced a sensation of detachment from her immediate environment, as though it was not real, making her world similar to that of a video game. She reported that in the apartment where she had previously been living, she had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of her neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant her harm. She explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. She reported hearing her neighbors commenting negatively about her appearance. These distressing experiences prompted her to return to her family home, but she continued to hear her neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about her appearance and began to hear them commenting on her actions and thoughts in the third person as well.

Given the clinical presentation, it is crucial to consider ACS broadly until further differentiation can be made by angiography and other investigations.\n\n**Step 3: Aortic dissection**\n- The severe, sudden onset of chest pain could also be indicative of aortic dissection, particularly given the high blood pressure history. However, the ECG findings favor a coronary event.\n\n**Step 4: Pulmonary embolism (PE)**\n- Although less likely due to the specific ECG changes, PE should still be considered in the differential, as it can present with chest pain, shortness of breath, and elevated cardiac biomarkers.\n\n**Step 5: Pericarditis**\n- This condition might present with chest pain and ECG changes, including ST-segment elevations, although these are generally more diffuse than in AMI.\n\n**Step 6: Prinzmetal's angina**\n- Prinzmetal's angina involves transient ST-segment elevations typically due to coronary artery vasospasm. It’s generally not associated with elevated troponin unless there is resultant myocardial injury.\n\n**Step 7: Stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy)**\n- Often precipitated by physical or emotional stress, presenting with chest pain and changes on ECG, sometimes mimicking STEMI, but typically without coronary artery blockage.\n\n**Step 8: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**\n- GERD can cause chest pain that may mimic cardiac pain, though it would not typically account for the ECG changes or elevated troponin.\n\n**Step 9: Costochondritis**\n- This is an inflammation of the rib cage that could cause chest pain, but without the ECG changes or troponin elevation.\n\n**Step 10: Esophageal spasm**\n- Can present with chest pain mimicking cardiac origins but lacks the specific cardiac biomarker elevations and ECG changes seen in acute cardiac events.\n\n### Rerank Based on Patient Presentation and Tests\n\n1. **Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)**\n   - Most consistent with the symptomatology, ECG findings, and elevated troponin.\n\n2. **Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**\n   - Broader category that includes AMI, fitting the clinical picture until definitive angiographic differentiation.\n\n3. **Prinzmetal's angina**\n   - Possible due to coronary vasospasm considering past mild coronary irregularities, but less likely due to troponin elevation.\n\n4. **Stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy)**\n   - Could present very similarly to AMI, but coronary angiography typically doesn’t show significant blockages.\n\n5. **Aortic dissection**\n   - While the initial presentation might suggest this, the ECG findings and angiography likely rule it out.\n\n6. **Pulmonary embolism (PE)**\n   - Considering the cardiac specific findings, PE is less likely though initially part of the differential.\n\n7. **Pericarditis**\n   - Typically has more diffuse ST changes on ECG.\n\n8. **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**\n   - Could still be taken as a potential non-cardiac source of pain, though the other cardiac findings are more compelling.\n\n9. **Esophageal spasm**\n   - Less likely given the clear cardiac findings.\n\n10. **Costochondritis**\n   - Least likely given the ECG changes and troponin elevation, normally absent in musculoskeletal conditions.", "topic": "['Obstetrics and Gynecology', 'Pregnancy', 'Obstetrics', \"Women's Health\", 'Cardiology']"}

He stated that “I think I have a kidney stone blocking my kidney” but denied nausea, vomiting, fever, dysuria, hematuria, or weight loss. He had no history of chronic abdominal pain. Past surgical history was noteworthy for emergency exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy for blunt trauma 14 years prior. Physical examination revealed a comfortable-appearing patient in no acute distress. His temperature was 36.8°C; pulse, 77/min; and blood pressure, 125/86 mm Hg. Abdominal palpation elicited only mild epigastric tenderness without masses or rebound. There was no costovertebral angle tenderness. Laboratory data revealed normal levels of serum urea nitrogen and creatinine and normal liver function. A complete blood cell count showed leukocytosis (15 300/μL with 54% neutrophils, 38% lymphocytes, 8% monocytes); hemoglobin level, 15.5 g/dL; and hematocrit, 45.2%. Urinalysis revealed no red or white blood cells and was negative for leukocyte esterase and nitrate.

His comorbidities included congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and a 50-pack-year history of tobacco abuse. Physical examination revealed a firm, nonmobile, nontender, bulging mass situated over the right frontal sinus, which expanded to the upper right eyelid. The mass covered the globe completely, resulting in total vision obstruction (Figure, A). However, the patient’s vision remained intact when the mass was elevated off the eye with great effort. His right pupil was round and reactive to light without afferent pupillary defect. No palpable lymphadenopathy was noted. A non–contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a large, right supraorbital mass with bony destruction of the anterior table of the right frontal sinus (Figure, B). It extended into the superior aspect of the orbit, displacing the right globe inferiorly. Air was seen within the mass (Figure, C). A fine-needle aspiration biopsy yielded inconclusive results.

The lesion was itchy but without generalized pruritus. The patient reported a weight loss of 10 pounds over the preceding 3 months. In addition, he reported a longer history of vague, nonspecific, intermittent abdominal pain without nausea, vomiting, or fever starting about 3 years prior to presentation. Previous work-up had revealed minimal abdominal adenopathy, but the patient declined further workup. On examination, he had no other cutaneous lesions, but he did have cervical lymphadenopathy. All other physical findings were within normal limits. Laboratory findings were unremarkable, save for a mild normochromic normocytic anemia and a mildly elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase. A biopsy specimen from the skin lesion is shown in Figure 1B. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ", "true": "Follicular lymphoma", "predict": "### Step 1: Basal Cell Carcinoma\nBasal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) is a common type of skin cancer, often appearing as a lesion that can rapidly increase in size and may have a pearly appearance. Considering the patient's age and the description of the lesion, it's a plausible initial differential diagnosis.\n\n### Step 2: Squamous Cell Carcinoma\nSquamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) is another common type of skin cancer in older adults. Like BCC, SCC can manifest as a rapidly enlarging lesion. It can be more aggressive than BCC and associated with symptoms like itching.\n\n### Step 3: Cutaneous Lymphoma\nGiven the presence of cervical lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms like weight loss and unexplained anemia, a cutaneous lymphoma such as mycosis fungoides or other T-cell lymphomas could be considered.\n\n### Step 4: Metastatic Cancer\nThe patient’s weight loss and vague abdominal pains may indicate an underlying metastatic cancer with secondary skin involvement. This could suggest a primary origin from organs like the pancreas or lung.\n\n### Step 5: Kaposi Sarcoma\nKaposi sarcoma generally presents in immunocompromised patients but can appear in the elderly and often results in lesions that could be initially mistaken for more benign skin conditions.\n\n### Step 6: Merkel Cell Carcinoma\nMerkel Cell Carcinoma is a rare, aggressive cancer typically presenting in the elderly as rapidly growing, firm, nodular lesions. It can also be associated with systemic symptoms.\n\n### Step 7: Amelanotic Melanoma\nThis type of melanoma lacks the pigment melanin that usually colors melanoma lesions and can initially appear as a simple, non-pigmented “pimple.”\n\n### Step 8: Sebaceous Carcinoma\nAn uncommon and aggressive malignancy, sebaceous carcinoma can originate in the oil glands of the skin and may not always exhibit typical features.\n\n### Step 9: Pyogenic Granuloma\nThis is a benign vascular lesion that can rapidly increase in size and is prone to bleeding. Its benign nature but aggressive appearance makes it a differential to consider.\n\n### Step 10: Atypical Fibroxanthoma\nThis is a rare benign skin tumor that predominantly occurs in the older population and could clinically resemble more aggressive malignancies.\n\n### Reranking Based On All Patient Information:\n1. **Cutaneous Lymphoma** - The systemic symptoms, lymphadenopathy, weight loss, and nonspecific abdominal symptoms align closely, especially considering the lymph node involvement and the image shown.\n2. **Metastatic Cancer** - Given the patient's systemic signs like weight loss and abdominal pain, a primary cancer with skin metastasis could be plausible.\n3. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** - Fits the description of a rapidly enlarging itchy lesion with the capability of regional metastasis such as to cervical lymph nodes.\n4. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma** - Matches the rapid growth, elderly age group; systemic signs could potentially be related.\n5. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** - Common and fits the initial presentation but less likely due to the systemic symptoms.\n6. **Amelanotic Melanoma** - Possible given an unusual presentation and aggressive nature, though less typical without pigment.\n7. **Sebaceous Carcinoma** - Its rarity and aggressive nature keep it in the differential but lower due to less commonality.\n8. **Kaposi Sarcoma** - Less likely in the absence of immunosuppression but could present similarly.\n9. **Atypical Fibroxanthoma** - Possible but rarer and usually less aggressive systemically.\n10. **Pyogenic Granuloma** - Least likely given the systemic symptoms and rapid progression, though its appearance might fit.", "topic": "['Dermatology', 'Oncology']"}
