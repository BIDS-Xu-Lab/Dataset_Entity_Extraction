Per her history, the lesion was noted over 18 years in the past by her optometrist. She reported no noticeable growth or changes to the lesion but was sent for evaluation with ocular oncology. Visual acuity with correction was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 14 mm Hg in the right eye and 16 mm Hg in the left eye. Anterior segment examination results were within normal limits for the left eye, and dilated fundus examination results for both eyes did not reveal concerning pathology. The conjunctiva of the right eye was notable for a small elevated pigmented lesion measuring approximately 2 × 2 mm with sentinel vessels (Figure 1A). Fundus photographs and autofluorescence (Figure 1B) as well as optical coherence tomography (OCT) were normal bilaterally. An anterior-segment OCT was performed and revealed a small elevated subepithelial lesion with shadowing vs possible scleral extension (Figure 1B). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ",

Ophthalmology was consulted to evaluate for a conjunctival foreign body of the left eye. At the time of the examination, his symptoms had resolved; however, he had a photograph from a cellular phone taken during the episode (Figure 1). The photograph shows an irregular, serpiginous extension from beneath the plica semilunaris toward the corneal limbus with localized conjunctival hyperemia. He reported a similar sensation of movement in his left eye that occurred for 1 night about 5 years ago for which he visited an urgent care center where he was diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis. He also reported recent swelling of the left side of his face with associated numbness and occasional swelling of his left hand, all of which resolved after a few days. He had immigrated from Nigeria 10 years prior, had not returned since, and was working as a traveling nurse. A slitlamp examination did not reveal any conjunctival hyperemia, foreign bodies, or other abnormalities like those shown in the photograph. His uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20, extraocular movements were full and without pain or abnormal sensation, and intraocular pressure was normal. His dilated fundus examination was unremarkable.

Local antiglaucoma therapy with a fixed-combination prostaglandin and β-blocker was used regularly in both eyes owing to long-standing primary open-angle glaucoma. Uneventful cataract surgery with phacoemulsification and in-the-bag insertion of an intraocular lens was performed 10 years earlier in both eyes.  Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 1.0 and 0.5 (Snellen equivalent, 20/20 and 20/40) OD and OS, respectively. His manifest refraction revealed a difference of −0.75 D sphere compared with his own preexisting glasses in the right eye. IOP was 24 mm Hg in the right eye and 18 mm Hg in the left eye. Slitlamp examination revealed a milky substance in the retrolental space, more pronounced in the right eye (Figure) but evident in both. The rest of the slitlamp examination was unremarkable with moderate superficial punctate keratitis owing to ocular surface disease, an anterior chamber depth of Van Herick grade 4 (peripheral anterior chamber depth >1 corneal thickness), an absence of anterior chamber inflammation, and a moderate amount of Elschnig pearls in both eyes. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ",

She denied a history of fever, otorrhea, prior ear infections, vertigo, or otologic surgery. The patient first saw her primary care physician, who visualized a mass in the right ear canal and attempted needle aspiration, which led to self-resolved bleeding. She was given ciprofloxacin ear drops and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, which did not improve her symptoms. On examination, her right external auditory canal (EAC) was completely obstructed by a fleshy, pulsatile mass with a red hue (Figure 1A). Results of Weber tuning fork examination lateralized to the right ear and a Rinne examination suggested a conductive hearing loss. Formal audiogram results confirmed conductive hearing loss in the right ear and type B tympanometry, which was indicative of poor eardrum mobility. Computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone without contrast showed a well-circumscribed 9-mm lesion in the EAC with bony erosion along the junction of the anterior wall and floor (Figure 1, B and C).

He reported receiving anticoagulation therapy in the past for a mitral valve problem. His visual acuity was 20/200 OD and 20/20 OS. The examination of the left eye was unremarkable. Slitlamp examination of his right eye revealed 3+ anterior chamber inflammation with vitreous cells. An examination of the dilated fundus showed optic nerve edema with an overlying white infiltrate. In addition, there was inferior retinal whitening consistent with an artery occlusion (Figure 1A). The whitening was attributable to inner retina ischemia, with sparing in the distribution of the cilioretinal artery. An inferior hemicentral retinal artery occlusion was confirmed on intravenous fluorescein angiography (Figure 1B). No embolus was noted at any retinal artery branch points.

No lymphadenopathy was noted. Laboratory results showed normal serum calcium levels and leukocyte counts. Initial ultrasonography showed a 4.2-cm solid nodule adjacent to the lower pole of the right thyroid. Computed tomography results of the neck showed a 3.4-cm circumscribed, heterogenous, hypodense, enhancing mass that was abutting the inferior right thyroid and at the right lateral margin of the trachea. The mass was just medial to the right common carotid, causing left lateral displacement of the trachea (Figure 1). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ",

The lesions started as an erythematous papule on the face, which had progressed to larger plaques within 10 years. There was involvement of the upper respiratory tract, causing palatal perforation and stridor, necessitating a tracheostomy a year ago. In addition, there was history of wheezing and breathlessness. There was no history of preceding trauma, fever, malaise, joint pain, cough, epistaxis, hemoptysis, or hematuria. Examination revealed multiple well-defined brown erythematous scaly plaques with central scarring measuring 2 × 1 to 8 × 7 cm on the face, arm, and thighs. The patient also had saddle nose deformity, perforation of the hard palate, and necrotic plaques on the ear, causing destruction of ear cartilage (Figure, A and B).

Two months prior to presentation, the patient had awoken with bilateral linear “gashes” in her mandibular vestibule that were accompanied by bilateral buccal facial swellings. Since that day, the facial swelling remained unchanged, and although the mucosal lesions healed, the oral pain persisted. The patient’s medical history was noteworthy for depression, for which she was taking bupropion and fluoxetine, and prior alcohol use disorder, for which she was 3 years sober. She denied any smokeless tobacco use but endorsed daily electronic cigarette use. The extraoral examination detected bilateral buccal facial swelling of the lower facial third without associated trismus or lymphadenopathy (Figure, A). Intraorally, bilateral scarring of the mandibular buccal vestibule was noted with focal areas of ulceration. Small aphthous ulcerations were also present on the right buccal mucosa (Figure, B). An incisional biopsy of the right vestibular lesion was performed, and the specimen showed diffuse plasmalymphocytic infiltrates within the lamina propria. On higher magnification, noncaseating granulomatous inflammation was observed (Figure, C). Staining for acid-fast bacilli was negative. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ",

He had occasional nonbloody loose stools but no fevers or vomiting. Although he was otherwise well, his growth had fallen from the 75th to the 25th percentile for height and weight over the preceding 9 months, and he could speak only 2 words. His medical history was notable for atopic dermatitis and diarrhea in infancy that prompted allergy testing at age 6 months; he was subsequently diagnosed with milk, egg, and peanut allergies. His parents avoided feeding him these foods, providing him only soy-based milk and formula, with improvement of dermatitis, until age 1 year. Since then his diet had consisted of multiple rice milk feeds daily, supplemented only with pureed fruits and vegetables, pasta, snack puffs, and sunflower butter. The patient had no history of meconium ileus or family history of cystic fibrosis. There was no recent travel and no changes to the home environment. On presentation, the patient was irritable, with normal vital signs. He displayed prominent scrotal swelling and pitting edema of the legs bilaterally. Skin examination was notable for erythematous, denuded patches with peeling scale and reticulate hyperpigmentation, accentuated on the abdomen, back, diaper area, and extensor extremities (Figure; left panel). Notably, his skin also demonstrated widespread patches of hypopigmentation, with an accompanying band of hypopigmentation proximally at the site of newest hair growth (Figure; right panel). \n### OUTPUT:\n    ",

Previously, he had been well, with morphological remission found on a recent bone marrow biopsy. The patient had no significant dermatological history, except an allergy to cashew nuts and a prior episode (6 mo) of urticaria during a platelet transfusion that had resolved with 1 dose of oral antihistamine. The patient’s medications included ondansetron, aprepitant, prednisolone, and oxycodone (supportive care initiated with chemotherapy), and long-term posaconazole and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole treatment. Lesions were noted on day 2 of the fourth cycle of a chemotherapy regimen comprising fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim (G-CSF). Initially present over the distal limbs, palms, and soles, the lesions progressed to the proximal limbs and lower trunk during 24 hours (Figure, A and B). The patient developed a fever, which we extensively investigated. Intravenous cefotaxime was commenced, but because no infectious source was identified, the fever was thought to be secondary to cytarabine. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ",

He had emigrated from Ghana 2 years before but denied any illness there. His visual acuity without correction was 20/20 OD and 20/20 OS, although he had to manually elevate his eyelids to see the Snellen chart. He had no movement of the right eye past midline in elevation, adduction, depression, and abduction and no movement of the left eye past midline in elevation, depression, and abduction, with 50% deficit of adduction. His external examination results were notable for a margin reflex distance 1 of −4 mm OU and a levator function of 0 OU. On funduscopic examination, his optic nerves were sharp and pink without atrophy, maculae and retinal vasculature were normal, and peripheral retina appeared normal without pigment abnormalities.

She self-presented 6 days later with intermittent visual blurring, mild eyelid swelling, and conjunctival chemosis. The IOP remained raised (24 mm Hg). An inflammatory or allergic etiology was suspected; therefore, topical corticosteroids and a prostaglandin analogue were also prescribed. One week later at planned follow-up, the patient had dilated and tortuous bulbar blood vessels (Figure 1).

Multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists during which eyes were dilated showed normal results. Clinical examination revealed 180° of left interior subconjunctival hemorrhage with overlying conjunctival elevation and mild fullness of the left lower eyelid (Figure 1A). Fixation was central, steady, and maintained bilaterally, with full ocular motility and absence of appreciable proptosis. Penlight anterior segment examination demonstrated normally formed anterior segment structures without inflammation or hyphema in either eye, although the left eye exhibited a small intraocular lightly pigmented lesion at the 5-o'clock limbus. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) was deemed appropriate and further demonstrated normal intraocular pressures bilaterally. Handheld slitlamp examination localized the left eye 2-mm limbal lesion on the posterior corneal surface. The surrounding corneal and iris structures were normal appearing without evidence of vascularization. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was used to further evaluate both the intraocular lesion and better characterize the left lower eyelid fullness. This demonstrated no iris, angle, or ciliary body involvement by the intraocular lesion. A 10-MHz contact B-scan examination showed a large inferior orbital lesion measuring more than 17 mm in the anterior-to-posterior dimension (Figure 1B). Doppler ultrasonography did not demonstrate significant flow to suggest a vascular cause. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ",

There was a family history of cutaneous melanoma in his 2 sisters, daughter, and nephew and breast cancer in his mother and sister. We completed genetic testing of family members and found no genetic mutations in sera samples to predispose them to melanoma skin cancer or breast cancer. The main genes tested were the breast cancer type 1 susceptibility (BRCA1), breast cancer 2–DNA repair associated (BRCA2), partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2), and tumor protein p53 (TP53) genes. A dermoscopic examination of the patient showed a translucent lesion with arborizing vessels and erosion (Figure, B). A punch biopsy was performed. \n### OUTPUT:\n    ",
