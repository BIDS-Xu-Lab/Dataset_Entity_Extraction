The patient had been in his usual state of health until approximately 1 week before admission, in midsummer, when subjective fevers and increasing urinary frequency developed. He contacted his physicians office; nitrofurantoin was prescribed, and he was advised to hydrate well. During the following week, there was partial improvement of his symptoms. He continued to be physically active until 2 days before admission, when fatigue and increasing somnolence developed. He slept most of the next day. In the evening, he appeared slightly confused and had difficulty placing a thermometer in his mouth. The temperature was 39.1C. He was taken to the emergency department of another hospital. Shortly after arrival, the patient became nauseated, with vomiting and progressive somnolence. On examination, the temperature was 38.5C, the blood pressure 142/48 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while he was breathing ambient air. He appeared confused and did not follow commands. The remainder of the examination was normal; the patient did not have slurred speech, and there were no focal neurologic findings. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and blood levels of glucose, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, calcium, magnesium, and lactic acid were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis reportedly revealed cloudy yellow urine, with a dipstick test showing moderate occult blood, a small amount of leukocyte esterase, protein 30 mg per deciliter, and no nitrites and sediment examination revealing 15 to 20 white cells and 10 to 15 red cells per high-power field, with occasional bacteria and epithelial cells. A chest radiograph reportedly was normal. Cultures of the blood and urine were obtained. Computed tomography CT of the brain showed no evidence of an acute intracranial process. Vancomycin and ciprofloxa-cin were administered for possible urosepsis, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. After admission, the patient was noted to be persistently febrile, speaking incoherently, and unable to follow a conversation. Renal ultrasonography, in a limited study, reportedly revealed possible mild hydronephrosis of the left kidney and a cyst, 2.1 cm by 2.9 cm, in the left kidney. An indwelling Foley catheter was placed. Later that day, he was transferred to this hospital. Relatives reported that the patients perceived work of breathing and nonproductive cough had increased since admission to the other hospital. There was evidence of recent bilateral hydrone-phrosis, with worsening chronic renal failure blood level of creatinine, 2.9 mg per deciliter 260 mol per liter, prostatitis, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of the prostate gland had revealed hypertrophy and inflammation. Two months before admission, photoselective vaporization of the prostate had been performed with a laser, after which the creatinine level decreased to 1.8 mg per deciliter 160 mol per liter. The patient had hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, premature ventricular contractions, and allergic rhinitis. He had had basal-cell carcinoma; he also had had orthopedic injuries, including chest-wall trauma and reconstruction, after a motor vehicle accident. Medications before admission included meto-prolol, nitrofurantoin, aspirin, and doxazosin. He was allergic to penicillin and sulfa drugs. He was married and worked in an office. He lived in an urban area of New England and had recently visited a forested region of New England, which reportedly had heavy tick and mosquito burdens; his wife reported no known tick exposures. He drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. His father and paternal grandfather had had heart disease, and his mother had died in her 30s of an intracerebral hemorrhage. On examination, the patient was warm, dia-phoretic, and obtunded, with nonverbal moaning. The temperature was 38.4C, the blood pressure 158/67 mm Hg, the pulse 52 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 25 to 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while he was breathing oxygen by nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The conjunctivae were injected. He was unable to follow commands or track his eyes in response to his name. A lesion on the right side of the tongue was consistent with a possible bite. His neck was stiff, without pain elicited on passive movement. Bronchial breath sounds throughout all lung fields obscured the heart sounds. Palpation of the right lower quadrant induced wincing; examination of the abdomen was otherwise normal. The extremities were warm and well perfused, without edema. Distal pulses were symmetric and normal. On neurologic examination, the pupils were 4 mm in diameter and constricted to 3 mm with light. Extraocular movements were difficult to assess, but they appeared intact, without nystagmus. Pinching the right arm induced grimacing, pinching the right great toe induced minimal withdrawal of the right leg, and there was no response to pinching the left arm or leg. Move-ment of all limbs was otherwise nonpurposeful and spontaneous. The tone was increased in the arms, with cogwheel rigidity and myoclonus. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, and lactic acid and results of coagulation and liver-function tests; other results are shown in Table 1. Review of a peripheral-blood smear revealed thrombocytope-nia. Urinalysis revealed cloudy, yellow urine with a pH of 5.5 and a specific gravity of 1.015. The urine had trace ketones, 2 occult blood, and 2 protein and was positive for leukocyte esterase; there were 3 to 5 red cells, few white cells, few bacteria, few squamous cells, and very few transitional cells per high-power field and 10 to 20 granular casts and mucin per low-power field. An electrocardiogram showed ventricular bi-geminy, at a rate of approximately 100 beats per minute, but a true ventricular rate of 55 beats per minute; the native QRS complex was narrow, without a prolonged PR interval. A chest radiograph showed low lung volumes and increased opacity at the left lung base, which were thought to represent atelectasis, pneumonia, or pleural fluid. A lumbar puncture was performed, requiring multiple attempts because of the patients rigidity and movement; results of cerebrospinal fluid CSF analysis are shown in Table 1. Specimens of blood, sputum, urine, and CSF were cultured. Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: CT of the brain performed without the administration of contrast material revealed mild, nonspecific periventricu-lar hypoattenuation. There was no evidence of an acute intracranial process. An extraaxial mass 9 mm in greatest dimension that was consistent with a meningioma was noted overlying the left sylvian fissure. Dr. Goldstein: Ceftriaxone, meropenem, and acyclovir were administered. During the second night, the patient became increasingly tachypneic and required increasing suction to clear his airway. He was transferred to the intensive care unit ICU, and the trachea was intubated for airway protection. CT of the abdomen revealed moderate bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter, findings that were not changed from studies 2 months earlier. Dr. Gonzalez: The next day, magnetic resonance imaging MRI and magnetic resonance arteri-ography revealed a small amount of material with restricted diffusion layering in the occipital horns of the right and left lateral ventricles Fig. 1, which was thought to be most consistent with purulence and ventriculitis. The mass noted previously was visualized, with no evidence of infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, or a hemody-namically significant intracranial arterial lesion. Dr. Goldstein: During the next 3 days, episodes of hypertension to more than 200 mm Hg systolic occurred and were treated with labetalol; propofol was administered for respiratory efforts in dyssynchrony with the mechanical ventilator. On the seventh day, diagnostic test results were received.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "West Nile virus meningoencephalitis.

Pinsky Psychiatry: A 12-year-old girl was seen in the outpatient psychiatry clinic of this hospital because of severe irritability, hypersomnia, and multiple somatic symptoms. The patient had celiac disease but had been otherwise well until approximately 8 months earlier, when she became increasingly irritable and reported daily stomachaches, tingling and pain in her arms and legs, dizziness, anorexia, and severe fatigue; she also became increasingly somnolent, sleeping up to 13 hours per night. She had frequent angry outbursts directed at her mother and sister, and acted out physically on occasion. She became increasingly isolated from her friends and lost interest in activities. Her performance in school deteriorated, and she failed mathematics. Approximately 4.5 months before this presentation, red-cell indexes and results of thyroid-function tests were normal, and testing for heterophile antibody was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. She was referred to the outpatient gastroenterology, neurology, and psychiatry clinics of this hospital. The patient was born to a 39-year-old mother by cesarean section because of maternal preeclampsia, and her childhood development was normal. A diagnosis of celiac disease had been made at the age of 8 years, when she presented with abdominal pain and constipation; elevated levels of tissue transglutaminase antibody 70 U per milliliter and endomysial antibody 80 U per milliliter were detected, and examination of a biopsy specimen of the duodenum showed changes consistent with celiac disease. She adhered to a gluten-free diet and had been otherwise well. She had a history of anxiety and depression; she had no response to a trial of sertraline but did have a response to both escitalopram, begun 2 years before this evaluation, and 7 months of cognitive behavioral therapy. Sixteen months before this evaluation, the first of three episodes of severe vomiting requiring intravenous hydration occurred; subsequent episodes occurred 6 months and 4 months before this evaluation, each preceded by fever and viral symptoms. There was no associated headache, and neurologic evaluation including an electroencephalogram was reportedly normal. The patients mother noted that the patient had a long history of daydreaming. She had not begun to menstruate. She had no history of head injury, loss of consciousness, urinary symptoms, hospitalizations, or surgery. Her only medication was 10 mg daily of escitalopram. She had no known allergies. She lived with her parents and younger sister. Her mother had thyroid disease; maternal and paternal aunts, a paternal uncle, and her paternal grandmother had celiac disease; a paternal uncle had bipolar disorder; and other relatives had anxiety, depression, or attention deficithyperactivity disorder ADHD. There was no family history of cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, liver disease, pancreatitis, or diabetes mellitus. On examination, the patient was slim and appeared exhausted, without apparent physical dis-tress. The blood pressure was 83/52 mm Hg, the pulse 102 beats per minute, the head circumference 53.2 cm, the weight 35.4 kg, and the height 149.9 cm, with a body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters of 15.8 12th percentile for age. The skin was freckled, with multiple dark nevi and slight hyperpigmentation in the axillae. Results of cranial-nerve testing and funduscopic examination were normal. Strength was full throughout. Reflexes were brisk, and plantar responses were flexor. Clonus 2 to 3 beats, unsustained on the right foot occurred, but the finding was not easily repeated. The patient initially rocked on her feet during tandem gait but later skipped and jumped without difficulty. Results of sensory examination and Romberg testing were normal. When talking with the psychiatrist, the patient focused primarily on her pain and fatigue. She appeared withdrawn and disengaged, with a sad and apathetic affect. Her speech was sparse, slow, and soft at times, and eye contact and spontaneous movements were limited. Her three wishes were to have a cell phone so she could call her mother when she became nervous while waiting for her mother to pick her up at school, to have different friends, and to have school be different. There was no delusional content, suicidal ideation, or hallucinations. In the waiting area, she fell asleep, awakening to gentle shaking but not to voice. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head was normal. Diagnoses of major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder were made. Weekly therapy sessions were begun. During the next 3 weeks, the administration of escitalo-pram was changed to bedtime; the administration of bupropion was begun and gradually increased to 75 mg daily. The patient continued to have worsening dizziness, lightheadedness, headaches, stomachaches, and musculoskeletal pain. She had two episodes of vomiting at school, with nonbloody, nonbilious emesis and dry heaves, and her oral intake decreased. On repeat examination in the psychiatry clinic 6 weeks after the initial evaluation, the patient appeared listless and pallid. Her weight was 34.0 kg. She was referred to her pediatrician for further evaluation. On examination at the pediatricians office 5 days later, the weight was 32.9 kg. Blood levels of platelets, glucose, total protein, albumin, total and direct bilirubin, alanine aminotrans-ferase, and C-reactive protein were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Bupropion was stopped, and she was referred to the emergency department of another hospital. On examination, the blood pressure was 87/45 mm Hg, the pulse 92 beats per minute with the patient in a supine position and 124 beats per minute while she was standing, the tympanic temperature 36.4C, and the weight 33.5 kg. The remainder of the examination was normal. An electrocardiogram reportedly showed sinus rhythm at 100 beats per minute, with a normal axis, a prolonged QT interval corrected for heart rate of 505 msec, a T-wave inversion in lead III, and bi-phasic T waves in lead V3. Test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Major depressive disorder and high suspicion for a concurrent medical illness.

She had been well until the age of 24 years, when she began having episodes of a feeling of walking through a cloud, hearing spoken words without understanding, an inability to speak, and vertigo. A witness described events lasting less than 1 minute, during which the patient would stare at her hands, make gripping movements, and sometimes swear, and then be confused for 2 to 3 minutes. She had little memory of events after the episodes. During several episodes, she lost muscle tone and collapsed. During the next 8 years, episodes recurred at an accelerating rate, sometimes with loss of consciousness, abrupt collapse, and occasional incontinence. The frequency increased 4 to 5 days before menses. Three months before this evaluation, the patient struck her head during a typical episode. She was admitted to another hospital, where results of magnetic resonance imaging MRI, electrocardiography ECG, echocardiography, Holter monitoring, routine and 3-day ambulatory electroencephalography EEG, and multiple blood tests were reportedly normal; no episodes occurred during monitoring. There was no symptomatic improvement after the administration of triptans or beta-blockers. Subsequently, the frequency of episodes increased to at least daily. On evaluation at this hospital, she reported no fever, chills, rashes, neck pain, tinnitus, baseline vertigo, palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, cough, weakness, numbness, gastrointestinal symptoms, or changes in vision, hearing, balance, gait, or bladder habits. Between the ages of 9 and 22 years, she had had occasional episodes of syncope after painful stimuli such as immunizations or blood draws. She took no medications and had no known drug allergies. She lived with her husband and children and worked in a pharmacy. She drank alcohol infrequently, had stopped drinking caffeinated beverages after the onset of these symptoms, and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her mother had a history of headaches and drug abuse, and her father was healthy; there was no family history of neurologic diseases. On examination, the blood pressure and pulse were normal, with appropriate orthostatic changes. A detailed neurologic examination and the general physical examination were normal. A diagnosis of probable complex partial seizures with secondary generalization was made, and the patient was advised to stop driving. Two months later, a 72-hour ambulatory EEG captured 10 seizures arising from the left temporal lobe, all of which were noted by the patient. Lamotrigine was administered and the dosage was increased to 150 mg twice daily, with reduction in the frequency of events from three times daily to approximately once every 3 days. One month later, MRI of the brain was performed. Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: MRI was performed with and without the administration of contrast material Fig. 1, in accordance with an epilepsy protocol. On T2-weighted images, there is a well-demarcated focus of increased signal intensity in the left inferomedial temporal lobe. The mass does not enhance with gadolinium. It has heterogeneous signal intensity that is predominantly hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. The mass involves the occipitotemporal fusiform gyrus and causes mild local mass effect. The appearance is most suggestive of a primary brain neoplasm, such as a low-grade glioma. In retrospect, the same finding is present on the study from 6 months earlier, although it is harder to identify because of the positioning of the slices. Dr. Lyons: During the next 7 months, the patient continued to have staring spells, some of which were associated with sudden loss of postural tone and collapse. Antiseizure medications, including lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbaze-pine, and clonazepam, were aggressively adjusted without a clinically significant effect. Ten months after her initial outpatient evaluation, the patient was admitted to this hospital, and additional diagnostic testing was performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Left-temporal-lobe epilepsy due to a tumor in the left fusiform gyrus, most likely a glioma, complicated by ictal asystole in a patient with a predisposition to neurocardiogenic syncope.

The patient had been well until she was 16 years of age, when bilateral thyroid nodularity developed, with normal thyroid function. Pathological examination of tissue obtained by fine-needle aspiration at another hospital reportedly showed cyto-logic features that were suspicious for a follicular neoplasm. Near-total thyroidectomy 100 of the right lobe and 80 of the left lobe was performed. Postoperatively, levothyroxine was administered. Fourteen years later, a mass developed in the left side of the neck. Ultrasonogra-phy performed at a second hospital reportedly showed a nodule, 9 cm in diameter, in the left lobe of the thyroid. On cytologic examination, a sample of the nodule obtained by core needle biopsy reportedly was suspicious for a follicular neoplasm. A completion thyroidectomy with dissection of the strap muscles was performed. Pathological examination of the tissue reportedly showed no evidence of cancer. Postoperatively, hypoparathyroidism developed. Six months later, a mass recurred in the left side of the neck. During the next year, hot flashes developed, and a diagnosis of primary ovarian failure was made when the patient was 32 years of age. When the patient was 33.5 years of age, ultrasonography of the thyroid reportedly revealed a small amount of thyroid tissue on the right side and a new echo-genic thyroid nodule on the left side, which displaced the carotid artery. Cytologic examination of fine-needle aspirate from the nodule was reportedly suspicious for a follicular neoplasm. She was referred to the endocrinology clinic at this hospital. The patient reported no hoarseness, dysphagia, shortness of breath, or neck pain. She had a history of fibrocystic breast disease and had undergone multiple, benign breast biopsies, and she had been exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero. She had undergone a right ovarian cystectomy, stripping of varicose veins, and tonsillectomy, as well as excision of skin lesions on the face, with unknown histopatho-logical findings. There was no history of neck irradiation. Medications included levothyroxine, calcitriol, estradiol administered by a transdermal patch, and oral progesterone 12 days per month. She had an allergy to shellfish manifested by angioedema and had no known allergies to medications. She was married, had no children, and worked in an office. She drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her mother had thyroiditis, her father had had colonic polyps, and a sister had had a small goiter at 31 years of age. On examination, the blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg, the pulse 78 beats per minute, and the weight 95.3 kg. The patient was obese, with facial acne. There was a healed surgical scar on the neck and a mobile, rubbery nodule, 4 cm in diameter, in the upper left thyroid bed. A positive Chvosteks sign brisk twitching of the lips was elicited on percussion of the homolateral masse-ter region, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, thyrotropin, thyroglobulin, and thyroglobulin antibody were normal. Eight months later, the left thyroid nodule measured 6 cm in diameter on examination; computed tomography CT of the neck, performed without the administration of contrast material, and ultrasonography revealed a heterogeneous mass, 48 mm in diameter, with central calcification at the level of the left thyroid bed. Completion thyroidectomy of the left lobe with partial strap-muscle resection was performed. Pathological examination showed an adenomatous goiter and no evidence of cancer. Postoperatively, liothyronine l-isomer of triio-dothyronine T3 was administered. The blood level of thyrotropin was 26.4 U per milliliter normal range, 0.4 to 5.0 and the level of thyroglobulin 1.8 ng per milliliter normal range, 4 to 40. The thyroglobulin antibody and urinary iodine levels were normal. The 24-hour uptake of radioactive iodine iodine-123 was 9, and the scan of the thyroid with iodine-123 showed a single focus of intense uptake in the left thyroid bed and a subtle focus of uptake in the right thyroid bed. Whole-body scanning performed 3 days after an oral dose of 49.9 mCi of iodine-131 and immediately after the intravenous injection of 39.6 MBq of technetium-99m pertechnetate, with multiple dual-photon images of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, showed iodine uptake in the midline and the right side of the neck, findings suggestive of a remnant of thyroid tissue. When the patient was 35.5 years old, analogue mammography performed at another hospital revealed abnormalities in the left breast. Pathological examination of fine-needle aspiration biopsy and core-biopsy specimens of separate lesions in the left breast reportedly showed intraductal scle-rosing papilloma and benign ductal hyperplasia. One month later, the patient returned to this hospital. The blood level of thyroglobulin was less than 0.2 ng per milliliter. Blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, thyrotropin, and thyroglobulin antibody were normal. Focused ultrasound examination of the left breast showed a dilated duct 5 mm by 8 mm in cross section that consisted of mixed echotex-tures. During the next 5 months, four excisional biopsies of lesions in the left breast were performed. Pathological examination of the specimens showed ductal carcinoma in situ grade 2 spanning at least 1.2 cm; a low-grade phyllodes tumor, 1.1 cm; a hamartoma, 1 cm, with benign ductal hyperplasia; intraductal pap-illoma; atypical ductal hyperplasia; atypical lobular hyperplasia; atypical apocrine hyperplasia; and proliferative fibrocystic changes. The ductal carcinoma in situ cells expressed both estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor proteins. Treatment with estrogen and progesterone was stopped, and a course of radiation therapy was administered to the left breast. At the age of 36.5 years, the patient returned to the endocrinology clinic at this hospital for follow-up. On examination, there were micronodular lesions on the gingiva and tongue Fig. 1A and 1B; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Thyroid ultrasonography revealed a small hypoechoic region of the left thyroid bed that measured 6 mm in maximal dimension, an increase from 3 mm 1.5 years earlier. The blood level of thyroglobulin was less than 0.2 ng per milliliter. Blood levels of calcium, thyrotropin, and thyroglobulin antibody were normal. Additional diagnostic testing was performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome, phenotypically consistent with the Cowden syndrome.

Brown Medicine: A 29-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of anemia and jaundice. The patient had been in his usual health until 4 days before admission, when increasing fatigue, malaise, headache, intermittent testicular discomfort, yellowed eyes, dark urine, nausea, and diffuse body aches developed and chronic leg pain worsened. No fever, rash, hematuria, dysuria, melena, or neurologic symptoms were present. On the day of admission, he came to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient had been generally well, with intermittent asthma, acne, and chronic leg pain until 4 months earlier, when he traveled from an urban area of New England to his familys home in North Africa and stayed for 3 months. While he was there, a prolonged cough productive of green sputum developed, associated with fatigue, subjective fevers, chills, drenching night sweats, and intermittent dyspnea at rest, and he reportedly had a weight loss of 9.1 kg. Ten days after his return to New England, and 20 days before this admission, he was seen in the medical clinic at this hospital. On evaluation at that time, the patient appeared well. The weight was 92.7 kg, the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 23.6, and the pulse 101 beats per minute; the blood pressure and respirations were normal. Evaluation revealed mild acne, nasal turbinates that were boggy and pale and had clear secretions, slight tonsillar enlargement, inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and expiratory wheezes in both lung apexes, and surgical scars on the right leg. The level of platelets and results of hemoglobin electrophoresis were normal, and testing for human immunodeficiency virus HIV was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was normal. A Mantoux tuberculin skin test was negative. The patient was advised to continue the administration of fluticasone and albuterol by inhalers, which had been prescribed as treatment for asthma. He returned home. On the day of admission, he called his physicians office and was advised to go to the emergency department for evaluation. He was subsequently admitted to the hospital. The patient had a history of fractures of the right leg after a motor-vehicle acci-dent 3 years earlier, which required internal fixation of the tibia for nonunion, as well as bone and skin grafting; he had persistent chronic leg pain and venous swelling. One year before this admission, after tibial surgery, the hemato-crit decreased to 34.4, with a mean corpuscular volume of 77 fl normal range, 80 to 100; the anemia resolved within 4 months. Other medications included ginkgo biloba, a multivitamin, and nicotine patches for smoking cessation. He had no known allergies to medication. The patient had emigrated from North Africa to the United States 9 years earlier. He was a student, smoked marijuana and cigarettes, and reported no current alcohol or intravenous drug use. He was sexually active with his girlfriend. While the patient was visiting his family in North Africa, his 14-year-old brother died of an unspecified disease. During that trip, the patient was exposed to sheep and drank unpasteurized cows milk. His mother had osteopenia; his father and four other siblings were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 123/85 mm Hg and the pulse 115 beats per minute; the temperature, respirations, and oxygen saturation were normal. The patient appeared tired, with conjunctival icterus and jaundiced skin. The second heart sounds were loud, without murmurs. The abdomen was soft, with diffuse tenderness that was greatest in the right lower and left upper quadrants; the testicles were diffusely tender, without masses. Mild tenderness was present over the right knee and anterior shin, with healed surgical scars; the remainder of the examination was normal. The platelet count, white-cell differential count, and red-cell indexes mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were normal, as were the results of coagulation tests and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, lipase, thyrotropin, folate, and vitamin B12. Thick and thin peripheral-blood smears and rapid testing for malaria antigen, antibodies to HIV, and hetero-phile antibodies were negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. A direct antiglobulin test Coombs test was negative. Cultures of the blood were obtained. The results of urinalysis were normal, and the stool was guaiac-negative. An electrocardiogram was normal. A chest radio-graph showed clear lungs. Narcotic analgesia, ondansetron, dalteparin, phosphorus supplementation, and intravenous fluids were administered. Toxicologic examination of the urine revealed the presence of opiates and cannabi-noids. During the next 2 days, jaundice gradually improved. Blood cultures remained sterile. Additional test results are shown in Table 1. An ultrasound examination of the abdomen revealed mild hepatic steatosis; ultrasonography of the scrotum was normal. On the fourth day, a diagnostic test was performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Acute hemolytic anemia due to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.

Arias-Urdaneta Medicine: A 51-year-old woman was seen in the rheumatol-ogy clinic of this hospital because of recurrent bloody nasal discharge and oral ulcers. The patient had been well until 3.3 years before this presentation, when episodic bilateral epistaxis developed, associated with intermittent sore throat, blood-tinged sputum, and nasal crusting, without rhinorrhea. Two months after the onset of symptoms, examination by an otolaryngologist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary revealed a straight septum, with active bleeding bilaterally. Cauterization with silver nitrate was performed, followed by packing; nasal dryness and intermittent bleeding persisted. Six months after the onset of symptoms, fiberoptic nasal endoscopic examination revealed crusting in the nose, mucosal inflammation, and synechiae in the left nasal cavity, without masses or polyps. Amoxicillin with clavu-lanate was prescribed. Three months later, surgical repair of bilateral nasal vestibular stenosis, with polymeric-silicone splints, and biopsies were performed. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimens showed superficial fragments of squamous mucosa with mild atypia, hyperkeratosis, a prominent granular layer, and no evidence of cancer. A tapering course of prednisone starting at 40 mg daily and topical triamcinolone acetonide cream were administered, with partial improvement. During the next year, symptoms persisted despite multiple fiberoptic nasal endoscopic examinations, debridement of the crusted tissue, the application of topical antibiotic unguent, and nasal rinses. Approximately 20 months after the onset of symptoms, examination revealed complete obstruction of the nasal passages, with scab formation and no polyps or discharge; nasal cultures grew normal flora. Additional debridement was followed by the application of mupirocin ointment. Follow-up cultures grew moderate anaerobes and few Staphylococcus aureus. A 2-week course of clindamycin was prescribed. Approximately 1 year before this evaluation, painful ulcers developed on the buccal mucosa and tongue. Multiple courses of prednisone up to 40 mg daily, rapidly tapering over a period of 1 week were administered, with transient improvement during each course. Testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ANCA and antinuclear antibodies was negative. A chest radiograph and results of computed tomography CT of the sinuses were normal. During the next 4 months, episodes of epistaxis increased in frequency, in association with nasal crusting and sinus congestion. Eight months before this evaluation, on evaluation by a rheumatologist at this hospital, the patient reported dyspnea, cough, fatigue, ear fullness, and weight loss of 7 kg. Examination revealed normal vital signs and an ulceration on the tip of the tongue; the remainder of the examination was normal. The blood level of thyroid peroxidase antibody was 291.0 IU per milliliter reference range, 35.0, and antibodies to double-stranded DNA were positive at 1:40 dilution reference, negative at 1:10. The complete blood count was normal, as were the levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, creatine kinase, C-reactive protein, and immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, and IgM; results of tests of renal and liver function and serum protein electrophoresis were normal. Testing for syphilis with the use of rapid plasma reagin, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, and ANCA was negative, as was testing for antibodies to Ro, La, Sm, and ribonuclear protein. Colchicine, 0.6 mg twice daily, was administered for 1 week but was stopped because of diarrhea. The patient began to use dexa-methasone elixir mouthwash, with improvement in the oral lesions. CT of the chest revealed a hia-tal hernia. Approximately 5 months before this evaluation, intermittent rectal bleeding developed. Colono-scopic examination performed at another hospital reportedly showed two ulcers, 25 cm from the anal verge, without surrounding inflammation. Pathological examination of biopsy specimens of the lesions showed no evidence of ulceration or vasculitis; there were mild nonspecific findings of focal acute cryptitis and rare lymphoid aggregates. Serologic evaluation for inflammatory bowel disease was reportedly negative except for the presence of IgG antibodies to Saccharomyces cerevisiae 34.9 ELISA enzyme-linked immunosor-bent assay units per milliliter; reference range, 17.8. Omeprazole, colchicine, and vitamin B were prescribed, without improvement. The patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. The patient rated the pain of the oral ulcers at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain, and reported recurrent epistaxis, lower gastrointestinal bleeding, fatigue, nonrestor-ative sleep, arthralgias, and intermittent pain in the elbows and legs, without swelling, erythema, or increased warmth. She did not have alopecia, uveitis, rash malar or other, genital ulcers, or anal or perianal fistulas. She had a history of Hashimotos thyroiditis, hyperlipidemia, and migraines. A transient ischemic attack had occurred 3.5 years before this evaluation, associated with tinnitus in the right ear, numbness and weakness on the left side, and possible aphasia; the symptoms had resolved after several hours. Daily medications included atenolol, cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride, levothyroxine, prednisone 20 mg, tapering from 40 mg over a period of 7 days, sim-vastatin, and aspirin 81 mg. She was allergic to trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin with clavulanate, erythromycin, and tetracycline which had caused rashes, and ciprofloxacin. The patient was married, had two grown children, and worked in an office. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her mother and sister had celiac disease, and her sister also had scleroderma. On examination, the blood pressure was 140/91 mm Hg and other vital signs were normal. The weight was 76.2 kg. The oropharynx was pink, with numerous erosions of the mucous membranes of the mouth, including the tongue, soft palate, and inner buccal mucosa, without bleeding Fig. 1. The remainder of the examination was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and level of C-reactive protein were normal. A diagnostic procedure was performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Autoimmune blistering disorder, either pemphigus vulgaris or mucous-membrane pemphigoid.

Schoenfeld Medicine: A 54-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain, vomiting, and confusion. The patient was in her usual health until approximately 3 days before admission, when she reportedly began to feel unwell, with weakness, chills, and skin that was abnormally warm to the touch. She self-administered aspirin, without improvement. During the next 2 days, her oral intake decreased. Approximately 22 hours before presentation, vomiting occurred. Nine hours before presentation, she began to travel home to Italy from the eastern United States. During the next 2 hours, increasing abdominal pain occurred, associated with vomiting and shortness of breath, and she took additional aspirin for pain. Approximately 2 hours before presentation, while the patient was in flight, abdominal pain markedly worsened, vomiting increased, and she became confused and unresponsive. The flight was diverted to Boston. On examination by emergency medical services personnel, she was nonverbal and was moaning continuously. The blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg, the pulse 52 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute. The capillary blood glucose level was 116 mg per deciliter 6.4 mmol per liter. She was brought to the emergency department at this hospital by ambulance. The patients history was obtained from her husband through an interpreter. She had noninsulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, nephro-lithiasis, and chronic kidney disease. Medications included enalapril, metformin, glimepiride, nimesulide, imipramine, aspirin, and ibuprofen. She had no known allergies. She was married and had children. She lived in Italy and did not speak English. She had vacationed in North America for 10 days, traveling to urban areas. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs, and there was no history of unusual ingestions. On examination, the patient was incoherent and appeared agitated and uncomfortable, with frequent groaning. She was oriented to person only and opened her eyes to command. The blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg, the pulse 52 beats per minute, the temperature 36.7C, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95 while she was breathing ambient air. The pupils were 3 mm in diameter and minimally reactive to light; the oral mucous membranes were dry, and the neck was supple. The abdomen was soft, without distention, rebound tenderness, or guarding. The skin was cool. The remainder of the general examination was normal. The neurologic examination was limited because of the patients inability to follow commands; she withdrew all extremities to pain, and cranial nerves and strength appeared normal. Normal saline was rapidly infused, and dextrose, insulin, on-dansetron, and morphine sulfate were administered intravenously. An electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 115 beats per minute and a QRS duration of 94 msec, with a tremulous baseline possibly obscuring ST-segment depression in the inferior leads. Blood levels of calcium, triglycerides, glycated hemoglobin, and haptoglobin were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Placement of an indwelling urinary catheter was followed by placement of intravascular catheters in the right external jugular vein and the femoral artery. Within 2 hours after the patients arrival in the emergency department, tachypnea and increasing somnolence developed; results of venous oximetry are shown in Table 1. The trachea was intubated after the administration of etomidate and rocuronium, and 100 oxygen was administered and bicarbonate was infused. A chest radiograph showed no evidence of pneumonia or pleural effusion. There were ill-defined calcifications in the soft tissue of the left breast. Approximately 3 hours after the patients arrival, the rectal temperature decreased to 31.7C and the blood pressure to 84/43 mm Hg. Norepi-nephrine bitartrate and bicarbonate were administered; fluids were warmed before infusion, and a blanket warmer was placed. Dark-brown gastric secretions that were positive for occult blood were aspirated through an orogastric tube; the gastric pH was 5.7. Dr. Raul N. Uppot: Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis without the administration of intravenous or oral contrast material Fig. 1 revealed pancreatic edema, peripancreatic fat stranding, a small amount of perihepatic and pericholecystic fluid without biliary ductal dilatation, some thickened walls in several loops of small bowel, and an atrophic left kidney containing a nonobstructing calculus. CT of the chest revealed dependent atelectasis, with no focal consolidation, masses, or effusions, and calcifications of the left breast. CT of the brain was normal. Dr. Schoenfeld: Cefepime, vancomycin, and met-ronidazole were administered intravenously. After laboratory results were known, sodium polystyrene sulfonate was given orally. Toxicologic screening of the blood and urine was negative. The patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit ICU. Vasopressin, propofol, and calcium were added, and additional bicarbonate and glucose were administered. Eight hours after her presentation, continuous venovenous hemo-filtration with bicarbonate solution was begun. Cultures of the blood and urine were obtained. Fourteen hours after presentation, the urine sodium level was 136 mmol per liter, and the urine creatinine level was 0.25 mg per milliliter. Echo-cardiography revealed normal global cardiac function, without pericardial effusion. Dr. Uppot: Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed small-volume ascites, nonspecific thickening of the gallbladder wall, and an atrophic left kidney; there was increased renal parenchymal echogenicity of both kidneys Fig. 2. Dr. Schoenfeld: During the first 17 hours, the patient had oliguria, with approximately 125 ml of urine excreted. Additional laboratory tests are shown in Table 1.

The patient had been well until approximately 18 months earlier, when a diffuse, pruritic rash developed. During the next year, the rash progressed to total-body erythema. A diagnosis of psoriasis was made; topical glucocorticoids and oral cephaloridine were administered, without improvement. Five months before admission, the rash worsened. On examination at another facility, there was reportedly an extensive erythroderma of the extremities that was thought to be psoriasis; prednisone was administered orally. Shortly thereafter, fever and leg swelling developed, and the patient was admitted to another hospital. On examination, the temperature was 38.1C, and the pulse 145 beats per minute. Over the extremities was a diffuse, scaly, erythematous rash with a small amount of serous drainage, and there was warm, nonpitting edema of the legs; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and B-natriuretic peptide were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation and liver and renal function; tests for rheumatoid factor, syphilis, and hepatitis B and C viruses were negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was normal. Pathological examination of a skin-biopsy specimen of the left leg showed psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia with parakeratosis, as well as a mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the superficial dermis, features suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction. A diagnosis of psoriasis complicated by cellulitis was made, and broad-spectrum antibiotics and prednisone were administered. Cultures of the skin grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and cultures of the blood were sterile. Fevers resolved, and the patient was discharged on the seventh day, taking dicloxacillin 10-day course, orally and topical glucocorticoids. During the next 4 months, the erythroderma persisted, with intermittent exacerbations attributed to cellulitis. Three months before admission to this hospital, while the patient was taking trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, urticaria developed, associated with peripheral-blood eosinophilia. Levels of cobalamin vitamin B12 and folate were normal; testing for antibodies to Strongyloides stercoralis IgG, tissue transglutam-inase antibody, and IgA endomysial antibody were negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. The administration of trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole was stopped, and prednisone and topical glucocorticoids were restarted, with improvement in the urticaria. Eight days before admission, fever to a temperature of 38.0C developed, with worsening pruritus, erythema, and swelling of both legs. The patient was readmitted to the other hospital. On examination, there was diffuse erythroder-ma and left axillary lymphadenopathy. Oxacillin, mupirocin ointment, and triamcinolone cream were administered. Blood cultures were sterile. Hemoglobin electrophoresis was normal; testing for antibodies to SSA Ro, SSB La, filaria, trichinella, and cysticercus was negative. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. A hematologist noted very few of what were possibly Sezary cells on a peripheral-blood smear. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells for the BCR, ABL, CHIC2, PDGFRA, and FIP1L1 gene regions was normal, and no clonal rearrangement of T-cellreceptor genes was detected. A chest radiograph was normal. Dr. Bethany L. Niell: Computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis Fig. 1 after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material revealed bilateral axillary lymph-adenopathy 3 cm in the short axis, bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy 4 cm, bilateral small pleural effusions, and stranding of the subcutaneous soft tissues of the pelvis, features consistent with the history of bilateral leg edema. No mediastinal, hilar, or intraabdominal lymph-adenopathy was identified. Dr. Larson: Cytologic examination of a fine-needle aspirate of an axillary lymph node revealed small lymphoid cells. Flow cytometry showed no evidence of an abnormal lymphocyte population. On the eighth day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. Medications on transfer included doxepin, hydroxyzine, enoxaparin, acetaminophen, and lorazepam, with topical triamcinolone and mupirocin. The patient reported pain with walking, diffuse itching, dizziness, weakness, occasional dia-phoresis and shaking chills, weight gain of approximately 9 kg in the previous 2 weeks, and chronic headaches. She had no history of blood transfusions. She was allergic to aspirin angio-edema. She was born in Puerto Rico and had moved to the Boston area 5 months earlier to live with relatives and seek medical attention. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her father had died of heart disease, her mother had Alzheimers disease and pancreatic disease, and two nieces had systemic lupus erythematosus. On examination, the temperature was 37.3C, the blood pressure 110/58 mm Hg, and the pulse 126 beats per minute; the respirations and oxygen saturation were normal. There was diffuse confluent erythroderma with superficial scaling and erosions, foci of lichenification, palmoplan-tar hyperkeratosis, and follicular prominence on the back Fig. 2A, 2B, and 2C. There was mada-rosis, bilateral small ectropion of the eyelids, and painful pitting edema of the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. Testing for syphilis, the human immunodeficiency virus, and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. Pathological examination of a skin-biopsy specimen from the left leg showed changes consistent with an eczema-tous process. Examination of a biopsy specimen of a left axillary lymph node showed dermato-pathic lymphadenitis; flow cytometry showed no abnormal lymphocyte populations. Flow cytom-etry on a specimen of peripheral blood showed 35 T cells with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 10, with 7 CD3CD7 cells, which also expressed CD4, and normal expression of other antigens see Fig. 1A in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Clobeta-sol ointment and urea 40 cream were applied topically, with some improvement. Examination of skin-biopsy specimens of the left and right legs, obtained on the sixth day, showed eczema-tous and interface dermatitis, dyskeratotic cells, and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. The patient was discharged later that day. During the next year, the patient had persistent erythroderma, progressive alopecia, and recurrent infections requiring hospitalization and treatment with antibiotics, topical glucocorti-coids, and intermittent high-dose prednisone. Further evaluation included extensive patch test-ing, which revealed no positive allergens, and multiple additional skin biopsies, which were nondiagnostic. Test results from this period are shown in Table 1; other tests for autoantibodies were negative, and levels of tryptase, IgG, and IgA were normal, as were the results of other screening tests. Eleven months after the patients initial admission to this hospital, pain and swelling developed around an intravenous catheter site while she was receiving nafcillin intravenously and taking oral prednisone 60 mg daily, and she was readmitted to this hospital. The catheter was removed, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered. Cultures of the blood were negative. Additional diagnostic procedures were performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "The Sézary syndrome. ", "predict": "1. Sezary syndrome\n2. Erythrodermic psoriasis\n3. Atopic dermatitis\n4.

Kaufman: A 71-year-old man was seen in the outpatient cancer center of this hospital because of gross hematuria and a mass in the bladder. The patient had been well until 6 weeks earlier, when painless hematuria had developed, with passage of clots, while he was traveling in a wilderness area. After 2 days, he saw a nurse practitioner at a local facility. Attempts at passing a catheter into his bladder were unsuccessful, and he was referred to a hospital in a larger city. Computed tomography CT performed without the administration of contrast material reportedly revealed a multilobulated mass isodense to hyper-dense and measuring 8 cm by 7.5 cm by 6.5 cm in the urinary bladder, diffuse fat stranding in the perivesical and left periurethral regions, and bilateral intrarenal calculi and cysts. The next day, cystoscopic examination revealed an open pros-tatic urethra and brisk bleeding, making visualization of the bladder difficult. A fungating lesion at the anterior bladder neck at the 12 oclock position, with an adherent clot, was partially excised. Laser ablation resulted in hemostasis. Pathological examination of the tissue reportedly showed focal adenocarcinoma in situ that was thought to be of bladder origin and was associated with bland papillary and glandular epithelium, with no evidence of invasion. Five days later, bleeding persisted, and the patient was transferred to a second hospital, near his home. Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed bilateral renal cysts and bilateral nonobstructing nephrolithiasis. The next day, repeat cystoscopy reportedly revealed a large fungating lesion and clot at the anterior bladder neck at the 12 oclock position. Flushing of the bladder and biopsies were performed. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimens reportedly showed adenocarcinoma; consultation with outside experts was pending. CT of the abdomen, performed the next day, reportedly revealed no evidence of metastatic disease. After decompression of the bladder with a catheter, irregular thickening of the bladder wall was seen, with an irregular, multiloculated gas collection, 2.5 cm by 3.5 cm, in the suprapubic region. The patient was discharged on the fifth day to follow up with his urologist. Nineteen days before this evaluation, trans-rectal biopsies of the prostate were performed with ultrasonographic guidance. Pathological examination of the specimens revealed adeno-carcinoma in one of two cores from the right base, with a Gleason score of 7 grade 3 plus grade 4 on a scale of 1 to 10 with higher scores indicating a worse prognosis, involving 30 of the tissue, and adenocarcinoma in a core from the left lateral midportion, with a Gleason score of 6 33, involving 10 of the tissue. The patient was referred to the cancer center of this hospital. He reported that hematuria and clot passage had resolved and that he felt well. He had a history of lower urinary tract symptoms and urinary retention, for which a trans-urethral resection of the prostate had been performed elsewhere 12 years earlier. Pathological examination of the tissue reportedly had shown an area of focal high-grade prostate intraepithe-lial neoplasia. Four subsequent prostatic biopsies, the most recent performed 4 years before this evaluation, were negative for cancer. Levels of prostate-specific antigen PSA, measured annually, had been normal until 5 days after the second cystoscopy, 1 month before this evaluation, when the level was 13.0 ng per milliliter reference range, 4.0. The patient also had erectile dysfunction, hy-pertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, hyper-lipidemia, diverticulosis, mild obstructive sleep apnea for which he used continuous positive air pressure at night, and nephrolithiasis, which was treated with lithotripsy. Results of a colonoscopy performed 1 year earlier were normal. Medications included atorvastatin and verapamil; other medications doxazosin, amlodipine, val-sartan, telmisartan, hydrochlorothiazide, potassium aminobenzoic acid, oxybutynin chloride, and potassium chloride supplement had recently been stopped. He was married, had adult children, and was retired from the shipping industry, where he had been exposed to asbestos. He was physically active in outdoor activities. He did not smoke or drink alcohol. There was no family history of urologic cancers. On examination, the pulse was 50 beats per minute and the blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were normal. The body-mass index the weight in ki-lograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 30.0. Rectal examination was not performed, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The blood potassium level was 3.3 mmol per liter reference range, 3.4 to 4.8, the creatinine level 1.3 mg per deciliter 115 mol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter 53 to 133 mol per liter, and the urea nitrogen level 15 mg per deciliter 5.4 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter 2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter; the estimated glo-merular filtration rate was 59 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area reference range, 60. The complete blood count and levels of other electrolytes, calcium, and glucose were normal. A diagnostic test was performed, and management decisions were made.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder neck, the prostatic urethra, or both.

Neilans Medicine: A 46-year-old woman was seen in the emergency department at this hospital because of muscle pain and swelling in her arms and lower legs. The patient had been well until approximately 3 weeks before admission, when a deep ache developed in her left triceps, in the absence of trauma. During the following weeks, the pain persisted, gradually spreading to both arms and both legs, and was exacerbated by movement; she began having difficulty rising from chairs and climbing stairs because of pain. Two weeks before admission, examination by her primary care physician at another hospital reportedly revealed no focal muscle weakness. Red-cell indexes and blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, and glucose were normal, as were renal-function tests; testing for parvovirus B19 IgG and IgM antibodies was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Three days before admission, pain and swelling in the left arm worsened. She returned to the other hospital. Blood levels of alkaline phosphatase, direct and total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, and thyrotropin were normal, and testing for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus and Borrelia burgdorferi were negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. The patient returned home, with persistent symptoms. Three days later, she came to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient reported restricted range of motion of her arms because of pain, as well as stiffness in her proximal arm muscles that was worse in the morning. She also reported intermittent nondrenching night sweats that she attributed to menopause. She reported no muscle weakness, fever, chills, malaise, dysphagia, nasal regurgitation, synovitis, weight loss, numbness or tingling in her hands, shortness of breath, chest pain, changes in bowel or bladder function, nausea, vomiting, photosensitivity, or rash. A diagnosis of uterine fibroids with menorrhagia had been made 2 years earlier. Routine mammograms had been normal. Her only medication was megestrol acetate, taken midcycle 10 days per month. She had no known allergies. She was single, physically active, and had traveled widely. She drank alcohol in moderation, and she did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her mother had had breast cancer at age 65 years, and her father had had a myocardial infarction at age 57 years. There was no family history of rheumatologic or neuromuscular disorders. On examination, the blood pressure was 113/82 mm Hg, the pulse 101 beats per minute, the temperature 36.7C, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. When she was standing, her pulse increased to 120 beats per minute, without symptoms of dyspnea or light-headedness. Her voice was slightly gravelly, which she reported was unchanged. There was firm, nonpitting swelling and tenderness to palpation on the right shoulder and from the left shoulder to the hand. Both calves were tender to palpation, without visible swelling. Gait and muscle strength were normal, and she could easily squat, stand, and rise up on either foot on tiptoe. There was no rash, evidence of nail-bed infarcts, or impairment of respiratory excursions; the remainder of the examination was normal. The activated partial-thromboplastin time was normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glu-cose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, direct and total bilirubin, and thyrotropin. Results of renal-function tests were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed positive nitrites, 3 ketones, and trace occult blood and albumin; few bacteria, few squamous cells, and very few transitional cells were seen per high-power field. Screening of the urine for human chorionic gonadotropin hCG and toxins was negative. Ultrasonography of the left arm and right leg showed no deep venous thrombosis. Dr. Carol C. Wu: A chest radiograph showed a soft-tissue opacity, 9.0 cm by 9.0 cm by 12.4 cm, in the right lower hemithorax that obscured the right heart border, with no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema Fig. 1A. The opacity was seen anteriorly on the lateral view. The appearance was suggestive of an anterior mediastinal mass. Computed tomography CT after the administra-tion of intravenous contrast material Fig. 1B and 1C confirmed the presence of a large, anterior mediastinal soft-tissue mass with a smooth margin and heterogeneous density but with no evi-dence of internal calcification or fat. The mass abutted the right pericardium, with no distinct fat plane between the mass and the pericardium. There was no evidence of invasion into the pericardium. There was a small pericardial effusion. The superior vena cava was patent, but there was compression of the right atrium. There was no evidence of intrathoracic lymphadenopathy. There was no connection between the mass and the thyroid gland. The differential diagnosis included a thymic neoplasm, lymphoma, and a germ-cell tumor. In view of the absence of connection to the thyroid gland, a thyroid origin was unlikely. Lymphoma was considered to be unlikely in the absence of any other evidence of lymphadenopathy. Dr. Neilans: An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 111 beats per minute, left atrial enlargement, and minor, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Blood levels of parathyroid hormone, hCG, and alpha-fetoprotein were normal, and testing for antibodies to Ro, La, Sm, RNP, and Jo-1 was negative. On the third day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Inflammatory, necrotizing myopathy and myas-thenia gravis associated with thymoma.

Patil Medicine: A 6.5-month-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of fever, rash, and thrombocytopenia. The patient was well until the day before admission, when his mother noted bruising on both medial thighs, which she attributed to use of a jumping chair. On the morning of admission, she noted increased bruising on his thighs and broken capillaries on his cheeks and eyelids. On examination at another hospital, he was active and behaviorally appropriate. The rectal temperature was 37.4C, the pulse 146 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 45 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. There were multiple scattered petechiae on the face, chest, and legs; the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory results are shown in Table 1. He was transferred to this hospital. The patient was active and developmentally normal. At 3 months of age, intermittent urticaria had developed when small amounts of a milk-based formula were given, mixed with breast milk. There was no history of trauma, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, or blood in the urine or stool. He was born to a primigravida by cesarean section because of preeclampsia, after full-term gestation. Immunizations were current, excluding influenza A H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccines. Acetaminophen had been administered for teething pain until 2 days before this presentation. He had no known allergies. He lived with his parents and two dogs, did not attend day care, and had no exposures to sick persons. A cousin of his mother had splenomegaly of unknown cause; there was no known family history of hematologic disorders. The vital signs and physical examination were unchanged. The ABO blood type was A, Rh-positive, with negative screening for antibodies to red cells. Blood levels of electrolytes, phosphorus, magnesium, urea nitrogen, direct and total bilirubin, glucose, amylase, and lipase were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation and liver function; other test results are shown in Table 1. Anti-RhD immune globulin referred to as anti-D 550 g 50 g per kilogram of body weight was administered intravenously. Test results from the next day are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures drawn at the other hospital remained sterile, and the patient was discharged home. Subsequent outpatient evaluation revealed platelet counts of 120,000 per cubic millimeter on the second day after discharge and 32,000 per cubic millimeter on the sixth day after discharge; the hematocrit was 28.1, the hemoglobin level 9.6 g per deciliter, and reticulocytes 16.6. Ten days after discharge, the platelet count was 1000 per cubic millimeter. The patient was readmitted to this hospital. The pulse was 139 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the weight 11.2 kg; other vital signs were normal. There were isolated petechiae on the tongue and fine petechiae on the face and thighs. Test results are shown in Table 1. Intravenous immune globulin was infused, and the patient was discharged the next day. During the next 9 days, testing for antinuclear antibody was positive at a 1:40 dilution and negative at 1:80 and 1:160 dilutions normal, negative at 1:40 and 1:160 dilutions with a speckled pattern, and testing for anti-granulocyte antibodies was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. When the patient was 8 months of age, a diagnosis of milk allergy was made based on the presence of urticaria, diarrhea, and radioallergo-sorbent testing, and soy-based formula was begun. Diarrhea resolved, but he vomited frequently. Two months after the first admission, when the patient was 8.5 months of age, fever to a temperature of 38.9C developed that was unresponsive to outpatient ceftriaxone therapy. This was followed by worsening diarrhea, nonbilious emesis, and increasing lethargy over a period of several days, as well as fever to a temperature of 40C. Blood cultures were sterile. He was readmitted to this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 40C, the pulse 160 beats per minute, the blood pressure 101/56 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 11.7 kg. Nasopharyngeal tests for influenza A and B viruses were negative, as were stool tests for enteric pathogens, Clostridium difficile toxin, rotavirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, and ova and parasites. Testing for reducing substances in the stool and urine was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Blood and urine cultures were sterile. Results of renal ultrasonography were normal. Ibuprofen, intravenous fluids, and ceftriaxone were administered. Parenteral nutrition was administered for 3 days; fever and diarrhea resolved. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. A hypoallergenic formula was introduced. The patient was discharged home on the sixth day to take cefixime a 2-week course and acetaminophen as needed. Results of additional laboratory tests performed during the next 3 weeks are shown in Table 1.

Wong Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital: A 32-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus HIV infection was admitted to a hospital in Durban, South Africa, because of dyspnea and cough. The hospital is associated with Massachusetts General Hospital. Five months before admission, the patient was seen in an outpatient clinic in South Africa for evaluation of a lesion on his left upper eyelid. On examination, violaceous, raised lesions were present on the left eyelid and right side of the chest Fig. 1A. Dr. Pratistadevi K. Ramdial: Pathological examination of an excisional biopsy specimen of the chest lesion showed a malignant vasoformative tumor of the dermis. The tumor was composed of a nodular spindle-cell infiltrate arranged in short, interlacing bundles, with intervening slitlike vasculature and angiomatous foci. Intratumoral hemosiderin pigment, erythrocyte extravasation, hyaline globules, and a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate were conspicuous findings Fig. 1B. Immuno-histochemical staining for human herpesvirus 8 HHV-8 confirmed nuclear im-munoreactivity in the spindle cells Fig. 1C. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of Kaposis sarcoma. Dr. Wong: An antibody test was positive for HIV type 1 HIV-1, and the CD4 T-lymphocyte count was 330 per cubic millimeter reference range, 500 to 2010. In preparation for the initiation of antiretroviral therapy ART, the patient completed pretreatment classes. During the next 3 months, new skin lesions appeared on the thighs. Sixteen weeks before admission, a productive cough developed. Two weeks later, a specimen of sputum was negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis by polymerase-chain-reaction PCR testing and acid-fast bacilli staining and culture. The CD4 T-lymphocyte count was 268 per cubic millimeter. Dr. Pumersha Naidoo: A chest radiograph obtained 14 weeks before admission showed nodular opacities, 5 to 7 mm in diameter, in both lungs, most prominently in the middle and lower zones; there was loss of definition of the right hilum, with irregular peribronchovascular thickening and air bronchograms. No pleural effusions, hilar lymphadenopathy, or paraspinal masses were seen Fig. 2A. Dr. Wong: Eleven weeks before admission, therapy with tenofovir, lamivudine, and efavirenz was begun. A chest radiograph at the time of the initiation of ART revealed no changes. One week later, the patient was seen in the infectious diseases clinic at the hospital for evaluation of worsening productive cough, daily fevers of 2 weeks duration, weight loss of 2 kg, and night sweats. He reported full adherence with the ART regimen and noted no change in his skin lesions during the week he was receiving therapy. On examination, the temperature was normal. Small, violaceous lesions were noted on the left upper eyelid and thighs, with a healed surgical scar on the right side of the chest. The lungs and the remainder of the examination were normal. Additional sputum specimens were obtained; PCR testing and acid-fast bacilli staining and cultures for M. tuberculosis were negative. The patient returned home. Symptoms persisted, and a presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was made. Seven weeks before admission, the administration of rifampin, pyrazinamide, etham-butol, and isoniazid was begun. Worsening dyspnea, cough, malaise, anorexia, and an additional weight loss of 8 kg developed during the next 7 weeks, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. He reported increased numbers of skin lesions since his last visit, 10 weeks earlier. He had had a painless mass in the left inguinal region for the past 5 years, which he thought was a hernia caused by lifting weights. Approximately 3 weeks after the initiation of ART, the mass erupted and drained purulent material. Medications on admission included antiretroviral and antituberculous medications. The patient was born and lived in South Africa. He reported being heterosexual and monogamous with his wife. He had drunk alcohol socially until the onset of this illness; he did not smoke or use illicit drugs. His parents reportedly died of old age; his five siblings were healthy. He had no known exposure to tuberculosis. On examination, the patient appeared cachec-tic, with temporal wasting. The oxygen saturation ranged between 93 and 96 while he was breathing ambient air, and dyspnea developed with minimal exertion. The blood pressure was 95/63 mm Hg, and the pulse 120 beats per minute. There were crepitations over the left middle and lower lung fields; the liver edge was palpable 2 cm below the costal margin, and the spleen tip was palpable. Violaceous skin lesions were present on the legs, arms, torso, palate, and left eyelid. There was lymphadenopathy in the cervical and axillary regions, with a draining lymph node and a groove sign visible separation of enlarged inguinal and femoral lymph nodes by the inguinal ligament in the left groin. The blood levels of electrolytes, bilirubin, phosphorus, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal, as were the platelet count, red-cell indexes, and results of renal-function tests. The results of screening tests for hepatitis A and B viruses were consistent with immunity from previous exposure, and the results of screening for hepatitis C virus were negative; other results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Naidoo: A chest radiograph showed marked progression of previous radiographic findings Fig. 2B. There was extensive central perihilar and peribronchovascular confluent consolidation. Irregular nodular opacities were seen in the periphery of both lung fields, with some in the left upper lobe showing possible cavitation or air bronchograms. There were no pleural effusions. Dr. Wong: Grams staining of a sputum specimen revealed scanty gram-positive cocci, and a culture grew normal respiratory flora; Ziehl Neelsen and auramine staining, direct fluorescence antibody testing for P. jirovecii, and a myco-bacterial culture were negative. Theadministration of antiretroviral and antituberculous medications was continued, and doxycycline, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, prednisone, and oxygen 40, administered through a nonrebreather face mask were added. Diagnostic procedures were performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Cutaneous and visceral (pulmonary) Kaposi’s sarcoma. Kaposi’s sarcoma–associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.

Bogoch Infectious Diseases: A 19-year-old man was admitted to this hospital in early spring because of otalgia, slurred speech, and ataxia. The patient had been well until approximately 1 month before admission, when fatigue, fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy developed. Twenty-five days before admission, he went to another medical facility, where a test for streptococcal pharyngitis was negative. Eight days later, a heterophile antibody test was positive and the hematocrit, hemoglobin, and blood levels of total protein, albumin, and total and direct bilirubin were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis due to EpsteinBarr virus EBV infection was made. Two weeks before admission, dysphagia developed and pain and decreased hearing occurred in the right ear. On repeat evaluation, a diagnosis of otitis media was made, and prednisone 45 mg daily, for 5 days and amoxicillin for 2 days were administered, followed by azithromycin for 3 days. Eight days before admission, severe otalgia developed. On examination by an otolaryngologist, there was perforation of the right tympanic membrane, with bloody purulent material in the external ear canal. Oral cefuroxime 500 mg twice daily and an otic suspension of topical ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone were prescribed. Two days later, increasing unsteadiness developed; the patient fell several times during the next 5 days. The day before admission, he returned to the otolaryngologist; on examination, there was an effusion in the right middle ear. Myringotomy, with fluid aspiration, was performed. After the procedure, transient unsteadiness occurred, with vomiting; ear pain lessened, and hearing partially improved. After returning home, the patient noted slurred speech, clumsiness with movements, and increasing gait imbalance. Later that night, he went to the emergency department at another hospital. Ceftriaxone 1 g was administered, and he was transferred to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient reported fullness and decreased hearing in the right ear, weight loss of 4.5 kg, and persistent fatigue during the previous month, without neck stiffness, headache, photophobia, changes in vision, tinnitus, vertigo, sensory abnormalities, or difficulty with comprehension. He had a history of acne, asthma, and otitis media during childhood; he had undergone an inguinal herniorrhaphy as an infant. Medications at home included a combination of oxycodone and acetaminophen for otalgia and topical benzoyl peroxide. He had no known allergies. He attended college. He did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His paternal grandfather had polymyalgia rheumatica at 75 years of age and a stroke at 80 years of age; there was no other family history of neurologic or rheumatologic diseases. On examination, the patient was thin, alert, and oriented, with an appropriate affect. The vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. The right tympanic membrane was perforated, with dried blood in the external canal. The tonsils were enlarged 3 and erythematous. His speech was fluent and mildly dysarthric. Extraocular movements revealed slight saccadic undershoot, normal pursuit, and no nystagmus. Hearing comprehension of whispered words was slightly diminished in the right ear. He had dysmetria bilaterally on finger-to-nose testing, with end-point tremor; rapid alternating movements were irregular, and there was overshooting bilaterally when the patient attempted to follow the rapid finger movements of the examiner. Heel-to-shin testing was intact, but there was marked truncal ataxia with standing and walking. The remainder of the general and neurologic examinations was normal, including repetition and naming, strength, deep-tendon and plantar reflexes, and sensory examinations. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and platelet count were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, total protein, albumin, lipase, total and indirect bilirubin, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, vitamin B12, cholesterol, and lipo-proteins. Results of renal-function tests were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Mary E. Cunnane: Computed tomography CT of the brain and temporal bones, performed without the administration of contrast material Fig. 1A and 1B, reveals fluid in the right middle ear and mastoid air cells and hemorrhage within the right external auditory canal, findings that are consistent with the recent tympanostomy. There is no associated bony destruction, and both the roof of the middle ear and the roof of the mastoid are intact. The brain is normal in appearance. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the brain, performed without the administration of gadolinium, reveals opacification of the right mastoid air cells and middle ear, as well as prominent adenoids and cervical lymph nodes. No abnormality is evident in the brain, and the findings are otherwise normal. Dr. Bogoch: The patient was admitted to the hospital. Results of a lumbar puncture are shown in Table 1. The oral administration of cefurox-ime 250 mg twice daily was started by the admitting service. Dr. Cunnane: On the second day, repeat MRI of the brain with the administration of gadolinium was performed. Images from the MRI scan show unchanged opacification in the right mastoid air cells and middle ear Fig. 1C and 1D. There is no extraaxial fluid collection, acute infarction, mass lesion or mass effect, or signal abnormality or enhancement in the brain parenchyma. A magnetic resonance venogram shows normal flow-related enhancement in the dural venous sinuses, without evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or stenosis. A CT scan of the skull base, obtained after the administration of contrast material, shows opacification of the right middle ear and mastoid air cells, with no destruction of bony mastoid septa. The tegmen tympani and tegmen mastoideum are intact. Dr. Bogoch: Cefuroxime was stopped, vanco-mycin and ceftriaxone were administered intravenously, and antihistamines and metoclopramide were also administered. The patients symptoms persisted. On neurologic examination on the fourth hospital day, the patient was awake and cooperative but inattentive, with mild anomia and impaired verbal fluency and verbal working memory. Comprehension was normal. The ability to perform simple arithmetic was impaired, and he persever-ated when performing the Luria fist-palm-side test of alternating motor sequencing, which is sensitive to executive dysfunction from lesions of the prefrontal cortex.1 Eye movements showed continued hypometric saccades and catch-up to both the left and the right sides. Speech was mildly dysarthric. He had hypotonia throughout. There was dysdiadochokinesia in both arms and dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing. There was proximal overshoot on heel-to-shin testing. The gait was wide-based and unsteady, and the patient veered to either side. He was unable to perform tandem walking and lost his balance when standing with his feet together. The remainder of the examination, which included Weber and Rinne tests and tests of visual fields, strength, deep-tendon and plantar reflexes, and sensation, was normal. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Acute infectious mononucleosis due to Epstein– Barr virus infection, complicated by acute otitis media and postinfectious cerebellitis.

The patient was reportedly well until unintentional weight loss occurred approximately 6 weeks before presentation. Three weeks before presentation, upper abdominal pain developed that the patient rated at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The pain radiated to his throat, increased after eating and drinking, and did not diminish with ibuprofen. At the outpatient clinic, the patient reported nausea, occasional vomiting, decreased food intake, and a loss of 10 kg from his usual weight of 64.4 kg. He reported no headaches, visual changes, neck stiffness, dyspnea, substernal chest pain, lower abdominal pain, diarrhea, back pain, dysuria, rashes, or joint pain. He had had a respiratory illness approximately 2 years before this evaluation. He had no known allergies. He was born in Central America and had been living in the United States for 4 years. He worked in agriculture and did not speak English. He smoked cigars occasionally, drank alcohol infrequently, and did not use illicit drugs. On examination, the patient appeared cachectic. The temperature was 37.3C, the blood pressure 101/68 mm Hg, the pulse 114 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while he was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds and without tenderness or distention. There was macular hyperpigmentation of the feet and legs that reportedly had not changed for 10 years. The remainder of the examination was normal. Urinalysis revealed 1 protein and was otherwise normal. Ranitidine was prescribed, and the patient returned home with instructions to follow up the next day when test results were available. Blood levels of glucose, calcium, phosphorus, lipase, and amylase were normal, as were the results of tests of liver and renal function. Testing for antibodies to hepatitis C virus was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Carol C. Wu: A frontal chest radiograph showed subtle, tiny nodules throughout both lungs, without focal consolidation Fig. 1A. There was no evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Dr. Reza: Two days later, the patient returned to the outpatient clinic. He reported persistent abdominal pain that he rated at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, as well as sore throat, fever, and one episode of hematemesis that had occurred the day before. He reported no cough, congestion, or improvement with ranitidine. The temperature was 38.3C, the blood pressure 105/65 mm Hg, the pulse 119 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. There were coarse breath sounds at both lung bases. The abdomen was firm, without distention, masses, guarding, or rebound; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Airborne precautions were instituted, and a face mask was placed. Acetaminophen was administered, and a tuberculin skin test was performed. The patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital. He was heterosexual and reported having no more than eight partners in his lifetime and consistently using condoms. There was no known history of exposure to tuberculosis. On examination, the temperature was 35.9°C, the blood pressure 100//65 mm Hg, the pulse 68 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 47.6 kg, the height 160 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 18.6. A white exudate was present on the underside of the tongue. A nontender, mobile lymph node, 1 to 2 cm in diameter, was present in the left submandibular chain, and additional nontender, mobile lymph nodes were present in the right submental region and the right cervical region. Fine rales were scattered throughout both lungs, and the abdomen was soft; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Blood levels of glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, lipase, and amylase were normal, as were the results of tests of liver and renal function; other test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Wu: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material revealed numerous nodules, 1 to 3 mm in diameter, randomly distributed in a miliary pattern (i.e., having an appearance that is similar to millet seeds [Figure 2]) in both lungs, without mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy (Figure 1B and 1C). To help evaluate the patient's abdominal pain, a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained that showed multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes and new, small bilateral pleural effusions. The mesenteric lymph nodes had low-attenuation centers that were suggestive of central necrosis (Figure 1D). There was no evidence of bowel dilatation or bowel-wall thickening. Dr. Reza: Specimens of blood, sputum, and urine were obtained. Intravenous saline and one dose of ceftriaxone and azithromycin were administered, followed by fluconazole, omeprazole, and nystatin suspension. Results of coagulation tests were normal. The patient was admitted to the hospital. During the first day, the temperature rose to 39.7°C. Acetaminophen was administered. Diagnostic tests and procedures were performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Gastrointestinal and disseminated histoplasmosis. The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

Desai Medicine: A 55-year-old woman with a history of autoimmune hepatitis was admitted to this hospital because of increasing lethargy, anorexia, and abdominal pain. Approximately 7 years before this admission, the patient received a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis at another hospital, and she began taking prednisone. During the next 6 years, splenomegaly, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, jaundice, and lethargy occurred, as did recurrent episodes of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and encephalopathy. A diagnosis of portal hypertension was made, and approximately 6 months before this admission, a transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt TIPS procedure was performed at another hospital. Approximately 3.5 months before this admission, the patient moved to Massachusetts. The following week, she was seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of intermittent headaches, weakness, dizziness, fatigue, and increasing abdominal and ankle swelling. She also had a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her medications included pred-nisone, lactulose, omeprazole, rifaximin, neomycin, ursodiol, lisinopril, folate, potassium chloride, and insulin. On examination, the patients vital signs were normal. Conjunctival injection and icterus, subconjunctival hemorrhages, and 2 pedal edema were present bilaterally, and the abdomen was soft, without tenderness or guarding; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of urea nitrogen, globulin, magnesium, amylase, and N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Ultrasonography of the abdomen with noninvasive Doppler evaluation of the abdominal vasculature revealed splenomegaly, 19 cm in maximal diameter normal range, 14 cm, and patency of the TIPS. The patient was advised to continue her medications at home, and referrals to a primary care physician and a hepatologist were made. Nine days later, the patient was found unresponsive on the floor at home. On examination by emergency medical services personnel, the capillary blood glucose level ranged from 30 to 39 mg per deciliter 1.7 to 2.2 mmol per liter; a glucose infusion was administered, and her condition improved. She was admitted to this hospital. Her physical and laboratory evaluations and imaging studies had not changed from previous examinations. She was discharged home on the second day. During the next month, testing for antinuclear antibody was positive at 1:40 and 1:160 dilutions, with a speckled pattern, and tests for antibodies to smooth muscle and viral hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Eight weeks before the current admission, she was readmitted to this hospital because of increasing fatigue and confusion of 1 weeks duration; she reportedly had stopped taking many of her medications. On examination, she was oriented only to self. The vital signs were normal, the skin jaundiced, the conjunctivae hyperemic, and the abdomen distended and soft, without tenderness. There was 1 peripheral edema, and the remainder of the general and neurologic examination, except mental status, was normal. An electrocardiogram ECG showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities. The glycated hemoglobin level was normal, testing for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus and parvovirus B19 was negative, and the result of a test for EpsteinBarr virus suggested past infection; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed 3 glucose 1000 mg per deciliter and 1 bilirubin, with 20 to 50 white cells, 3 to 5 red cells, few bacteria and squamous cells, and very few transitional cells per high-power field; calcium oxalate and mucin were present. Abdominal ultrasonogra-phy did not reveal a substantial amount of ascites. The patients medications were readministered and her mental status improved. A urine culture grew moderate mixed bacteria, and ciprofloxa-cin was administered for 3 days. The patient was discharged on the fourth day. On follow-up examination on an outpatient basis, increasing peripheral edema was treated with spironolactone and a short course of furosemide, and the condition improved. Insulin was administered on a sliding scale for glucose levels that were as high as 512 mg per deciliter 28.4 mmol per liter. The thyrotropin level was 6.17 U per milliliter reference range, 0.40 to 5.00, and the level of free thyroxine T4 was normal. Five days before the current admission, the patient returned to this hospital because of confusion, increasing lethargy, nonradiating mid-abdominal pain, and vomiting. An abdominal ultrasound examination was performed to as-sess the patency of the TIPS. Transverse images, obtained with and without the use of color-flow Doppler techniques, showed a patent TIPS, with normal velocities and hepatopetal flow in the main portal vein. Splenomegaly was also noted, with the spleen measuring 19.5 cm in maximal diameter. Furosemide was administered intravenously and then orally, and other medications were continued, with symptomatic improvement. Hepatology consultants calculated a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease MELD score of 20 on a scale of 6 to 40, with higher scores indicating more severe disease, and an outpatient evaluation for liver transplantation was recommended. The blood level of IgA was 561 mg per deciliter reference range, 69 to 309; blood levels of IgG and IgM were normal, with a normal pattern and without a detectable M component, and a follow-up measurement of blood levels of lactic acid was also normal. Dr. Sheela Agarwal: Magnetic resonance imaging of the liver performed after the intravenous administration of gadolinium revealed marked morphologic features of nodular cirrhosis and signs of portal hypertension, including spleno-megaly 19 cm in maximal diameter, upper abdominal varices, and a small amount of ascites. The main portal vein appeared patent, with proper positioning of the TIPS Fig. 1. Dr. Desai: The patient was discharged on the fourth day, with the plan that a visiting nurse would follow up. The next day, the patients anorexia and leg edema were exacerbated, and her oral intake decreased. Constant, ill-defined midabdominal pain occurred, without fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematuria, hematochezia, melena, chest pain, dyspnea, lightheadedness, or syncope. She returned to this hospital the following day. The patients medications included prednisone, lactulose, rifaximin, furosemide, spironolactone, glimepiride, insulin, neomycin, potassium chloride, folic acid, lisinopril, ursodiol, calcium and vitamin D supplements, and omeprazole. She was allergic to intravenous contrast material, which caused angioedema. She was born in Central America, spoke only Spanish, and immigrated to the United States more than 25 years previously. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There was no family history of liver or other gastrointestinal disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or cardiac disease. On examination, the temperature was 37.1C; the other vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. The patient had a depressed affect. There were bilateral subconjunctival hemorrhages and diffuse jaundice. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds and epigastric and mild lower abdominal tenderness during deep palpation and without distention, hepatomegaly, or a palpable spleen. There was no evidence of as-terixis, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. An ECG was unchanged, as compared with the ECG obtained 8 weeks before this admission. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Outpatient medications were continued; ceftriaxone and metronidazole were administered intravenously, and nutritional supplements were provided. Dr. Agarwal: On the second day, computed tomography CT of the abdomen performed after the oral administration of contrast material revealed cirrhosis with splenomegaly span, 16.2 cm and a TIPS in the proper position. In addition, diffuse wall thickening within the cecum and ascending colon, pericolonic fat stranding, and surrounding subcentimeter lymph nodes were present Fig. 2. The differential diagnosis for these findings includes ischemic, infectious, and inflammatory causes, although the right-sidedness is suggestive of neutropenic colitis. Dr. Desai: Hypotension, to 75/45 mm Hg, developed 2.5 hours after CT was performed. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Normal saline was infused, albumin and 4 units of red cells were transfused, and antihypertensive agents and diuretics were stopped; there was gradual improvement in blood pressure. Blood specimens were obtained for culture, and vancomycin, linezo-lid, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime were administered. Later that day, melena occurred. On the fifth day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Invasive fungal infection of the stomach. ", "predict": "### 10-Step Differential Diagnosis:\n\n1.

The patient was in her usual health until approximately 15 months earlier, when abdominal bloating and intermittent rectal pain and bleeding developed. On examination by a colorectal surgeon, palpation of the levator ani muscle replicated the pain. Flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed internal hemorrhoids. Diagnoses of levator ani muscle spasm and irritable bowel syndrome were made. Five months before presentation, intermittent nausea and eructation developed; rectal pain and constipation persisted, with occasional blood in the stool after straining. Four months later, repeat flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed no new findings. Nausea with coughing up or vomiting a small amount of blood, anorexia, epigastric and left upper quadrant pain, increased bloating, and gas developed, with one episode of diarrhea. The patient went to the emergency department at another hospital, where computed tomography CT reportedly revealed a possible fullness in the body and tail of the pancreas i.e., the distal pancreas. During the next week, constipation alternated with diarrhea, without melena or hematochezia. Nausea was most severe 20 minutes after eating; she took antacids and famotidine, without improvement. Two days before this evaluation, anorexia developed, and she stopped eating. Her husband brought her to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient reported pain in the epigastrium, left upper quadrant, midback, and left lower flank, as well as a 4.5-kg weight loss during the previous 3 weeks, decreased energy and concentration, and three episodes of small-volume hematemesis. She reported disruptive thoughts, including that she had cancer of the pancreas, stomach, or another organ and would die young; she spent most daytime hours on the Internet researching her symptoms and writing about her condition and had difficulty caring for her children. Her sleep was normal. She reported no suicidal or homicidal ideation, although her husband reported that she had said that if this was pancreatic cancer I am going to kill myself. Two years before this evaluation, postpartum mastitis had developed in the patient, along with anxiety that she had inflammatory breast cancer. She sought treatment from two primary care physicians PCPs and multiple specialists, despite advice not to do so. Laboratory-test results, magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the spine, mammography, and breast ultrasonography were reportedly negative. She was admitted to a 2-week day-treatment program at a psychiatric hospital. Sertraline up to 200 mg daily, clonaz-epam, gabapentin, and ibuprofen were administered, with partial improvement. After discharge, she reported that she was concerned about metastatic melanoma and multiple myeloma, and she consulted specialists; examination of skin-biopsy specimens and skeletal radiographs were negative. She continued outpatient counseling and behavioral therapy, and sertraline was tapered because her anxiety diminished and she had concerns about weight gain. She had a history of attention deficithyperactivity disorder ADHD, for which she had taken bupropion and a combination of dextroamphetamine and amphetamine in the past; she also had a history of uterine fibroids. Medications included sertraline 75 mg daily and clonazepam 0.5 mg twice daily. She had no known allergies. She was married, lived with her husband and two young children, and had recently moved to another state for her husbands employment. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had a history of depression with suicide attempts; her father had hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and lung and colon cancer; her paternal grandmother had colon cancer; her maternal grandmother had leukemia; and her sister and children were healthy. On examination, the vital signs were normal; the weight was 62.4 kg 10 kg less than 1 month earlier. The abdomen was soft, with epigastric and left upper quadrant tenderness, without rebound. She appeared anxious and sad and was intermittently tearful, with frequent hand-wringing and restating of a belief that she had cancer. The remainder of the examination was normal. Routine laboratory studies were normal. Urinalysis revealed 3 ketones, 1 blood, and a few squamous cells and bacteria per high-power field. Testing for urinary human chorionic gonado-tropin and for blood in the stool was negative. On review, the CT of the abdomen performed at the other hospital was interpreted as normal. Management decisions were made.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Somatic symptom disorder (hypochondriasis), generalized anxiety disorder, and attention deficit– hyperactivity disorder.

The patient had been well until 4:15 a.m. on the day of admission, when he became dizzy, diaphoretic, and weak and had sensations of rocking and counterclockwise movement after he rolled onto his stomach in bed. The symptoms improved when he rolled into the supine position, and he slept until 7 a.m.; on awakening, the symptoms recurred. When walking, he sensed he was tilting to the left but did not fall. The symptoms worsened throughout the morning; they were most severe with head movements and were associated with increasing nausea and, after 10 a.m., vomiting. He called his doctors office because of concern that he was having a stroke. He was advised to go the hospital and called emergency medical services. On examination, his skin was pale and dry and the blood pressure was 148/60 mm Hg; the other vital signs and the remainder of the examination were normal. He was brought to the emergency department at this hospital, arriving approximately 9 hours after the onset of symptoms. The patient reported facial tingling in the area surrounding the eyes, including the malar eminence, and a mild headache. He noted that his visual perception momentarily lagged behind his eye movements, and the lag was more severe when looking to the right than to the left. He had no diplopia, blurred vision, tinnitus, decreased hearing, difficulty swallowing, changes in sensation or strength, palpitations, chest pain, fever, or shortness of breath. He reported an episode of self-limited positional vertigo that had occurred several years earlier. He had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, asthma, sleep apnea for which he intermittently used continuous positive airway pressure at night, depression, meralgia paresthetica a painful mononeuropathy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, erectile dysfunction, and recurrent localized herpes simplex virus infection. He was left-handed. His daily medications included rosuvastatin, valsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, duloxetine, aspirin, and a multivitamin. He also received, as needed, a topical lidocaine patch for meralgia paresthetica; gabapentin for pain; vardenafil though he had not taken it recently; fluticasone propionate nasal spray and inhaler, albuterol, and loratadine for wheezing and asthma; and vala-cyclovir. He swam regularly, drank wine daily, and did not smoke. His siblings had arthritis and hypercholesterolemia, and his children and grandchildren were healthy. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented. The skin was pale and diaphoretic. The blood pressure was 123/89 mm Hg, and the pulse 58 beats per minute; the other vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. The sensation of light touch was slightly decreased over the malar eminence and the jaw on the left side and was normal over the eyelids, frontalis muscle, and upper neck. There was nystagmus on left lateral gaze, and sustaining left lateral gaze required some effort; the eye movements were slower from midline to the left than from midline to the right. He was able to reproduce the sensation of delayed visual return, which was more severe when moving his head to the right than to the left. When he was not supported, he tilted to the left. He walked cautiously and slowly, with a slightly broad-based gait, and was unable to perform tandem walking. Deep-tendon reflexes were slightly more brisk on the right side than on the left side. The remainder of the neuro-logic and general examinations was normal. The blood level of carbon dioxide was 21.9 mmol per liter reference range, 23.0 to 31.9, the level of glucose was 164 mg per deciliter 9.1 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter 3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter, the level of phosphorus was 1.2 mg per deciliter 0.4 mmol per liter; reference range, 2.6 to 4.5 mg per deciliter 0.8 to 1.5 mmol per liter, and the anion gap was 16 mmol per liter reference range, 3 to 15. Blood levels of other electrolytes, calcium, and magnesium were normal, as were results of the complete blood count and tests of coagulation, renal function, and liver function; screening for troponin I was negative. An electrocardiogram ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 59 beats per minute and no acute ischemic changes. Lo-razepam, ondansetron, and intravenous fluids were administered, and the patients condition partially improved. Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: Approximately 2 hours after the patients arrival, computed tomography CT of the brain, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed normal brain parenchyma and an extraaxial calcified lesion, 9 mm by 16 mm by 6 mm, in the left parafalcine area over the high parietal convexity; there was no intracranial hemorrhage, extraaxial collection, mass effect, or midline shift. Dr. Kim: The patient was admitted to the observation unit at this hospital.

The patient was in his usual health, with a history of prostate cancer, until approximately 2 months before admission, when urinary frequency and urgency developed. On digital rectal examination at another hospital, the prostate gland was normal. The blood level of prostate-specific antigen PSA was 0.07 ng per milliliter reference range, 0 to 4.0 ng per milliliter. Urinalysis revealed microscopic hematuria. Five weeks before admission, he saw his primary care provider for routine follow-up; the physical examination was unchanged. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Shortly thereafter, pain in a left lower tooth developed, with numbness of the face and jaw on the lower left side. His dentist prescribed 10 days of amoxicillin, but symptoms persisted. One month before admission, his dentist performed a root canal on a left lower molar, which was completed 10 days before admission. Nine days before admission, the patient returned to his internist; he reported persistent numbness of the lower lip and chin bilaterally, with shooting pain into the area of the left ear. On examination, cranial nerves II through XII were normal; there was slightly decreased sensation to light touch over the chin and lower lip bilaterally. The remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. Eight days before admission, cystoscopy was performed at the other hospital, with resection of an identified bladder tumor. Pathological examination of the tissue reportedly revealed low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, associated with inflammation. After the procedure, the patients family reported that he was depressed, with increasing lethargy, weakness, and anorexia. Two days later, extraction of the left lower molar was performed because of presumed infection. The next day, he was seen in the emergency department of the other hospital because of persistent hematuria, dysuria, and night sweats. He reported abdominal pain, which he rated at 6 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. Vital signs, oxygen saturation, and the physical examination were normal. Test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was positive for occult blood 3, protein 2, and nitrites. A urine culture was sterile. Narcotic analgesia and ciprofloxacin were begun, and he returned home. On the morning of admission, his wife noted increasing confusion, and his family brought him to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient had hypertension, mitral-valve prolapse, and a history of carcinoma of the prostate Gleason score of 6 on a scale of 1 to 10, with higher scores indicating a worse prognosis that had been treated with brachytherapy 10 years earlier; PSA levels remained normal after therapy. He had had nephrolithiasis decades earlier and a hip replacement. Medications included ciprofloxacin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, phenazopyridine, dutasteride, tamsulosin, and aspirin 81 mg daily. He had no known allergies. He was married, lived with his wife, and worked in an office. He exercised daily and did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His father had died of lung cancer at 59 years of age, and his mother at 89 years of age from natural causes; a brother had prostate cancer and alcoholism. On examination, the patient was somnolent but arousable, and oriented to person and time. The temperature was 36.0C, the blood pressure 140/61 mm Hg, the pulse 93 beats per minute and irregular, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93 while he was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft, without tenderness or distention. There was no peripheral lymphadenopathy and no palpable organomegaly. There was trace edema in both legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, total and direct bilirubin, lipase, amylase, troponin I, and cardiac isoenzymes were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation; other results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was positive for occult blood 2, protein 1, and nitrites. There was no occult blood in the stool. A chest radiograph was normal. An electrocardiogram showed a wandering atrial pacemaker with occasional nonconducted P waves, a ventricular rate of 91 beats per minute, first-degree atrioventricular block, and premature ventricular complexes; the rhythm was new as compared with 2 weeks earlier. In the emergency department, the patients temperature rose to 38.3C. Specimens of blood and urine were cultured. Metronidazole, cefepime, vancomycin, dalteparin, magnesium sulfate, and acetaminophen were administered, as well as intravenous normal saline and oxygen by nasal cannula. He was admitted to this hospital. Ultrasonography of the kidneys revealed left hydronephrosis and a cyst in the left upper pole. On the second day, computed tomography CT of the brain, performed without the administration of contrast material, was unchanged from previous studies. Testing for Clostridium difficile toxin in the stool was negative. Dr. James A. Scott: On the third day, CT scans of the chest and abdomen were obtained after the administration of contrast material. CT images of the chest Fig. 1A and 1B show right axillary lymphadenopathy, a subcarinal mass 5.6 cm in diameter, and superior mediastinal lymphade-nopathy, all showing heterogeneous enhancement. CT images of the abdomen Fig. 1C and 1D show extensive mesenteric, retroperitoneal, periceliac, peripancreatic, periportal, bilateral iliac, and right inguinal lymphadenopathy. Left hydroureteronephrosis is a result of obstruction by left-sided pelvic lymphadenopathy. In the left kidney is an enhancing, exophytic, lobulated mass, 2.5 cm in diameter. There is no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. Dr. Lindsley: The patients mental status improved, and the temperature returned to normal. During the next 6 days, drenching sweats occurred daily. Hypercalcemia resolved, cultures of the blood were sterile, and the administration of antibiotics was stopped. Additional test results are shown in Table 1.

The patient had been well until approximately 3 months before admission, when fatigue, malaise, and light-headedness developed that she attributed to a viral illness. Three weeks before admission, fatigue worsened, and dyspnea on exertion, bruising on the legs, dark urine, and headache developed. She reported that she felt like staying in a bed all day and needed assistance with showering. Two days before admission, she went to another hospital. The physical examination was reportedly normal, as were the results of coagulation tests. Screening for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus HIV and a rapid plasma reagin test were negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. She was admitted to the other hospital. Examination of the peripheral-blood smear reportedly revealed normal morphologic features of the white cells, a reduced platelet count, spherocytes, and polychromatic red cells. A direct antiglobulin test Coombs test was positive, and warm-reacting and cold-reacting autoantibodies were reportedly present. Results of serum and urinary protein electrophoresis were normal. Glucocorticoids methyl-prednisolone at a dose of 150 mg twice daily for 2 days, followed by prednisone at a dose of 70 mg twice daily were administered, as were ondansetron and folate, but the patients condition did not improve Table 1. Computed tomographic CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained after the intravenous administration of contrast material, were normal. On the second night, hypotension developed but improved after the intravenous administration of fluids. On the third day, the hematocrit was 16.8. One unit of packed red cells was transfused, and pantopra-zole was administered. The patient was transferred to this hospital because of difficulty finding additional red-cell units that were compatible with her antibody screen. On admission, the patient reported a weight loss of 2.3 kg during the previous week, intermittent blurred or double vision in both eyes, and for the previous 3 months, transient vesicular lesions on the thighs that resolved spontaneously within 2 or 3 days. She did not have hematuria, dysuria, chest pain, abdominal pain, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, arthralgias, myalgias, melena, or hematochezia. Approximately 3 years earlier, she had had a similar illness, with dyspnea, light-headedness, and an unintentional weight loss of 18 kg, which had gradually resolved spontaneously. She had a history of depression, anemia a hematocrit 6 years before admission was reportedly normal, and during childhood and pregnancy, epistaxis; she had had a hysterectomy at 22 years of age because of metrorrhagia after a cesarean section. Medications at home included bupropion, a multivitamin, and occasionally flax-seeds. She had no known allergies. She was born in South America, moved to the United States more than 10 years earlier, and worked with children. She had recently traveled to Central America and the Caribbean. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her father had hyperthyroidism, and her mother had diabetes mellitus; her siblings and child were healthy. On examination, the patients blood pressure was 105/55 mm Hg, and the other vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. She had mild conjunctival icterus and a single vesicular lesion 1 cm in diameter with an erythematous base on the posterior right thigh. The remainder of the examination was normal. The red-cell indexes mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were normal, as were the pro-thrombin time, the prothrombin-time international normalized ratio, results of renal-function tests, and blood levels of electrolytes, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, C-reactive protein, lipase, amylase, folate, and vitamin B12. Testing for partial-thromboplastin time to detect a lupus anticoagulant was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Examination of the peripheral-blood smear revealed macrocytes, poly-chromatocytes, microspherocytes, very few meta-myelocytes, predominantly normal platelets, and no schistocytes or malignant cells. Urinalysis revealed 3 urobilinogen and was otherwise normal. The blood type was O, Rh-positive; an antibody screen indirect antiglobulin test and a direct antiglobulin test were positive. The administration of prednisone, folate, and bupro-pion were continued. A swab of the lesion on the right thigh was sent for culture. Transfusion of 1 unit of leukoreduced red cells was begun, but pain and burning developed immediately at the site of the infusion. Another attempt was made, on the contralateral side; however, after the infusion of a few milliliters, pain, burning, and facial flushing occurred, and the systolic blood pressure fell from 94 to 84 mm Hg within 15 minutes. The transfusion was stopped, and the symptoms resolved. The culture of the lesion on the right thigh revealed herpes simplex virus type 2 HSV-2, a urine culture grew more than 100,000 mixed flora, and blood cultures were sterile. Additional test results are shown in Table 1. Diagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Autoimmune hemolytic anemia and thrombocy-topenia (Evans syndrome) due to systemic lupus erythematosus.

The patient had been well until approximately 2 weeks before presentation, when fatigue and malaise gradually developed. One week before presentation, she was seen in the outpatient clinic at this hospital for routine HIV follow-up. She reported having had unprotected intercourse with a new HIV-positive male partner 1 month earlier and was concerned about sexually transmitted diseases. Physical examination was normal. A complete blood count, measurement of electrolyte levels including calcium, and results of renal-function tests were normal; nucleic acid testing of a urine specimen was negative for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; other laboratory results are shown in Table 1. Immunizations for hepatitis A and B, influenza, pneumococcus, and combined tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis were administered. During the next week, an erythematous, nonpruritic, nonpainful rash developed over the patients chest and abdomen and then resolved spontaneously within hours. She reported episodes of epigastric and periumbilical abdominal pain, more severe at night, that awakened her from sleep; she had occasional brief, sharp abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant. Nausea occurred intermittently after eating, without alteration in the pain. Approximately 2 days before admission, episodes of right-sided chest pain developed, which increased with hiccups and deep inspiration and lasted up to 12 minutes. On the morning of admission, she awoke with right-sided chest pain that radiated to her left arm. The pain was associated with transient diaphoresis, nausea, and shortness of breath. She came to this hospital for evaluation. The patient reported unintentional weight loss of approximately 5 kg during the previous 2 months and mild constipation during the previous 2 weeks. Eight years before admission, a diagnosis of HIV type 1 HIV-1 infection was made during an evaluation of wasting, thrush, hair loss, and malaise; she has been receiving treatment with antiretroviral medications since then. Four months before admission, she transferred her care to this hospital, and baseline test results were obtained Table 1. She also had dyslipidemia, obesity, anxiety, depression, recurrent sinusitis, alcohol and opiate dependence, candidal vaginitis, chronic neuropathy in a glove-and-stocking distribution, gastroesophageal reflux disease, a history of herpes simplex virus type 2 HSV-2 and chlamydia infections, and a remote history of surgical procedures for a femur fracture and endometriosis. Medications included methadone, ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, a tenofoviremtricitabine combination, valacyclovir, trazodone, quetiapine, and bupropion. She was allergic to sulfa drugs and levofloxacin. She was a student and lived in a drug-free group home. She smoked cigarettes. She reported no ingestion of raw food, exposure to sick contacts or animals, or recent travel. On examination, the patient was obese; the vi-tal signs and examination were otherwise normal. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm at a rate of 61 beats per minute, with anterior ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities similar to those seen on a previous tracing. A complete blood count and a white-cell differential count were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, iron, iron-binding capacity, creatine kinase isoenzymes, troponin I, and troponin T; testing for antinuclear and antimitochondrial antibodies was negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Toxicologic screening of the blood and the urine was negative. Results of ultrasonography of the abdomen showed a dilated common bile duct but were otherwise normal, without evidence of intra-hepatic biliary-duct dilatation or sonographic Murphys sign localized tenderness over the gallbladder. Urinary human chorionic gonadotropin testing was negative. Urinalysis revealed orange, cloudy fluid with 1 bilirubin, 1 albumin, 2 urobilinogen, and 3 to 5 red cells and 0 to 2 white cells per high-power field, with mucin, few squamous cells, and bacteria present.

Rosenbluth Medicine: A 30-year-old man was seen in an outpatient clinic at this hospital because of fever and lymphadenopathy. The patient had been well until approximately 2 weeks before presentation, when an enlarging, tender lump developed at the posterior base of the neck on the right side. Two days before presentation, fever to a temperature of 39.4C, a mild headache, myalgias, chills, and fatigue developed. He took ibuprofen, but his condition did not improve, and he came to this hospital for evaluation. The patient reported no history of sore throat, coryza, or earache. He had had a low hemoglobin level in the past but was otherwise healthy. He reportedly had had a negative tuberculin skin test in the past, and he had not received an influenza vaccine during the previous year. He took no other medications and had no known allergies. He was born in India and came to the United States 4 years previously to attend school; his most recent visit to India was 6 months before presentation. He worked in an office and lived with a roommate. He was not sexually active and had no known exposures to sick contacts, animals, or blood products. He had stopped smoking 2 years before this presentation, drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. His parents had diabetes mellitus; there was no family history of autoimmune or connective-tissue diseases. On examination, the temperature was 38.9C, the blood pressure 129/80 mm Hg, and the pulse 104 beats per minute. A group of five tender lymph nodes, each approximately 1 cm in diameter, was present in the posteroinferior cervical chain on the right side; the lymph nodes in the posterior cervical chain on the left side and in both inguinal regions were nontender, and there were no abnormal lymph nodes in the supraclavicular or axillary regions. A systolic ejection murmur grade 1 out of 6 was heard at the cardiac base; the remainder of the examination was normal. During evaluation, the temperature rose to 39.5C and was associated with chills. Blood levels of glucose, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were results of tests of liver and renal function; testing for heterophile antibodies and rapid tests for streptococcal pharyngitis and influenza virus were negative. Additional test results are shown in Table 1. A blood culture was sterile. The administration of acetaminophen alternating with ibuprofen was recommended, as were fluids and rest. The patient returned home but was advised to return to the outpatient clinic if his condition did not improve. Two days later, the patient returned to the clinic. He reported decreased appetite, chills, sweats related to fevers, mild headaches and body aches, and a new nonproductive cough. On examination, the lymph nodes on the right side were slightly larger than on the previous examination and were slightly confluent; the lymph nodes on the left side and a submental lymph node were soft and mobile. Bronchial breath sounds were heard over the right side of the chest anteriorly, and the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Hemoglobin electrophoresis and DNA sequence analysis revealed hemoglobin D Punjab, an abnormal variant of the -globin chain of hemoglobin, at a level of 91.8, as well as a hemoglobin A level of 0 reference range, 95.8 to 98.0, a hemoglobin A2 level of 7.0 reference range, 2.0 to 3.3, and a hemoglobin F level of 1.2 reference range, 0.0 to 0.9; other test results are shown in Table 1. The patient declined testing for the human immunodeficiency virus HIV. Dr. Daniel F. Boyer: A fine-needle aspiration biopsy of an enlarged cervical lymph node was performed, and the aspirate showed a mixed population of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and occasional plasma cells. Some of the histiocytes contained cellular debris and angular, crescentic nuclei. The polymorphous composition of the aspirate and the mature appearance of the lymphocytes were suggestive of a reactive process Fig. 1. Grams and acid-fast staining of the aspirate revealed no organisms. Flow cytometry of the aspirate showed no immunophenotypic abnormalities. Dr. Rosenbluth: A blood culture and a culture of the aspirate were sterile. A chest radiograph was normal. The patient returned home again, with instructions to return to the clinic if fevers persisted. Two days later, the patient reported persistent fevers and a dull headache and was admitted to the hospital. He reported no night sweats, weight loss, rhinorrhea, neck rigidity, neck pain, vision changes, weakness, or numbness and no respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary symptoms. On examination, the blood pressure was 106/58 mm Hg, and the pulse 104 beats per minute; the respirations were 20 breaths per minute, with an oxygen saturation of 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air. There was a superficial ulcer on the right side of the lower lip, and the spleen tip was palpable approximately 3 cm below the costal margin; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Blood levels of lactic acid, C3, C4, haptoglobin, creatine kinase, and thyrotropin were normal; testing for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies was negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed yellow, clear fluid, with 1 occult blood, trace albumin, and few squamous cells per high-power field, and was otherwise normal. Fluids were administered intravenously, and another blood sample was obtained for culture. The maximal daily temperature was 40.7C on the first day. On the second day, the temperature rose to 40.8C. Dr. Victorine V. Muse: Computed tomographic CT scans of the neck and chest obtained after the administration of contrast material Fig. 2 showed lymph nodes measuring up to 9 mm in diameter in the submental, submandibular, and jugular chains and at the posterior cervical level; mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, the largest, at the subcarinal level, measuring 9 mm in diameter; bilateral, clustered axillary lymph nodes measuring up to 10 mm in diameter; a small, anterior peri-cardial effusion; a soft-tissue nodule, 4 mm in diameter, in the left lower lobe; mild centrilobular emphysema, predominantly in the upper lobe; and occasional subcentimeter cystic lucencies, predominantly in the paramediastinal lingula and right upper lobe. CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis obtained after the administration of contrast material showed spleno megaly, measuring 16.5 cm in the maximal craniocaudal dimension normal range, 14 cm; a cystic structure, 3.5 cm by 2.6 cm, in the interpolar region of the right kidney; and no evidence of lymphadenopathy in the abdomen or pelvis. Dr. Rosenbluth: Additional test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures remained sterile. Fevers recurred daily. A tuberculin skin test was negative after 48 hours.

Approximately 19 months before admission, 1 week after the patient had begun taking citalopram, the development of oral erosions, tongue swelling, and urti-carial lesions, approximately 1 cm in diameter, on her torso occurred. These symptoms were followed during the next several weeks by joint pain and swelling in her hands, fatigue, and low-grade fevers. Citalopram was stopped, and antihistamines were prescribed, which the patient reported that she did not take for religious reasons; during the next month, the lesions worsened. She was admitted to this hospital. The patient reported difficulty eating because of oral ulcers; she also reported pain on urination and defecation because of vaginal and anal lesions. She had a history of obesity, hypertension, and depression. Nine months before that admission 27 months before the current admission, she had an episode of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia associated with a tubo-ovarian abscess and complicated by bacterial endocarditis, infectious endophthalmitis causing near-total blindness, and a myocardial infarction due to a septic embolus from valvular vegetation. Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed at that time. Medications included furosemide, metoprolol tartrate, aspirin 81 mg daily, diphenhydramine as needed for itching, and a multivitamin. She was divorced and lived alone; she did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. For religious reasons, she was reluctant to take medications and was distrustful of the medical system. She was of African-American descent and had one adult child; her father had died in an accident, her mother had hypertension, and an aunt had breast cancer. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable because of oral lesions. The temperature was 38.7C. There were erosions on the inner lips and buccal mucosa, and there was edema of the lips. There were erythematous plaques with dusky centers on the abdomen; coalescent, erythematous, mildly scaly symmetric plaques on the back; and small oval erosions in the perianal area and vagina. The wrist, metacarpal, and proximal interphalangeal joints were tender, without swell-ing or erythema. Pathological examination of a cutaneous-biopsy specimen revealed interface dermatitis a finding consistent with erythema multiforme and a mild increase in dermal mucin deposition. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and acyclovir were administered; acyclovir was stopped when cultures for herpes simplex virus were negative. Screening for cold agglutinins was negative. When the course of antibiotics was completed, prednisone 40 mg daily and hydroxychloroquine were prescribed, but she refused the medication. She was discharged on the 12th day. Discharge medications included prednisone 40 mg daily, hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily, di-phenhydramine as needed, fluocinolone ointment 0.025, and betamethasone dipropionate ointment 0.05. Eighteen days later 17 months before this admission, the patient was readmitted because of a persistent and increasingly painful erosive, pruritic rash on her back; the oral and anogeni-tal lesions had resolved. She reported not taking prednisone or hydroxychloroquine. Examination revealed erythematous scaly plaques with central erosions on the back, chest, thighs, and buttocks. Laboratory results are shown in Table 1. A second skin-biopsy specimen showed findings consistent with bullous lupus erythematosus. Hydroxy-chloroquine and prednisone were prescribed, but the patient declined the medications. She was discharged on the seventh day. Six weeks later, the patient was admitted to Brigham and Womens Hospital BWH because of worsening blistering and erosive skin lesions during the past week. The temperature was 39.4C. Erythroderma of the face and torso was present Fig. 1A and 1B; there were erosions and large flakes of desquamation and scattered, fragile flaccid bullae and open blisters covering approximately 70 of the body-surface area, predominantly on the upper chest and breasts, with only a few plaques on the lower body and legs, and no lesions on the palms, soles, oral mucosa, or genitalia. Pathological examination of a third skin-biopsy specimen reportedly showed findings consistent with pemphigus foliaceus. Methylprednisolone 125 mg daily was administered intravenously for 3 days, followed by a tapering course of prednisone 60 mg daily for 3 days, then 50 mg daily and topical clobeta-sol, with rapid improvement in the skin lesions. The patient was discharged on the eighth day first to a rehabilitation hospital, then home, and she indicated that she would adhere to hy-droxychloroquine and prednisone therapy. The administration of hydroxychloroquine was begun, and prednisone was tapered. At a follow-up examination at BWH 10 days after discharge, there were no active skin lesions. After 3 months, the patient stopped keeping follow-up appointments with the dermatology service at BWH and declined follow-up with rheumatology. Seven months before admission, at a follow-up appointment with her internist at this hospital, she reported taking hydroxychlo-roquine 200 mg twice daily, prednisone 5 mg daily, furosemide, metoprolol, aspirin, diphen-hydramine, and topical glucocorticoid ointments, and she had no active skin lesions. Sometime thereafter, she stopped taking hydroxychloro-quine and prednisone. Eight days before this admission, the patient returned to her internist because of recurrent skin lesions and alopecia. There were tender, pruritic skin lesions on her scalp that were ulcerated and excoriated and in the periumbilical area. She declined admission but resumed using hy-droxychloroquine and topical betamethasone valerate lotion 0.1; the administration of vitamin A and D ointment was added. She declined oral prednisone therapy because of concern about diabetes mellitus and weight gain. On the day of admission, the patient was brought to the emergency department at this hospital because of worsening skin lesions and increasing pain rated at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. On examination, the vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. There were multiple flaccid bullous lesions and superficial erosions, with crusting and mild oozing on the chest, back, abdomen, and both arms and shoulders Fig. 1C and 1D. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, total and direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation and renal function; other results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was normal. Oxycodone 5 mg was administered, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. A diagnostic procedure was performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Pemphigus erythematosus.

Heath Medicine: A 32-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of loss of vision. The patient was in his usual health until 3 weeks before admission, when painless conjunctival injection developed in the left eye, associated with dryness. He self-administered ophthalmic tetrahydrozoline solution, and the condition resolved. Approximately 1 week before admission, the symptoms recurred and progressively worsened. Discharge with crusting was present in both eyes in the mornings. Three days before admission, he noted loss of vision on awakening, with light perception in the left eye and blurred vision in the right eye; vision in the right eye reportedly improved slightly after the administration of ophthalmic tetrahydrozoline solution. Discharge from the eyes and crusting on the eyelashes persisted. On the morning of admission, a relative visited the patient at his home and took him to the emergency department at another hospital. On examination, the vital signs were normal. Ophthalmic abnormalities were reportedly noted. Laboratory results are shown in Table 1. A metal eye protector was placed over the left eye and normal saline was administered intravenously. He was transferred by ambulance to this hospital, for coordination of ophthalmic care with Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, which is affiliated with this hospital. The patient reported that he had no ocular pain, pruritus, or grittiness and therefore had not sought evaluation earlier; reportedly it had been 1 week since he had looked in the mirror. He reported a 1-week history of pain in the right hip joint with radiation to the knee, a 3-week history of an acneiform rash on his face, and a 4-week history of rash on his lower legs. He reported no fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, oral ulcers, direct eye inoculation, or injury. He had hypertension and a history of alcohol and illicit inhalational drug use. He took no other medications and had no known allergies. He smoked cigarettes until the onset of this illness, when he also stopped alcohol intake; he reported no illicit drug use for 3 months. He lived alone and was unemployed. He reported that his father had spine fusion disease and that an aunt had had transient blindness. On examination, the patient appeared older than his stated age. He was alert, oriented, pale, and thin, with temporal wasting. The vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. The height was 181 cm, the weight 63.5 kg, and the body-mass index BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 19.4. Ophthalmologic examination revealed con-junctival injection in both eyes 2 ciliary flush on the right, and diffuse 3 injection on the left, with purulent crusting and discharge on the lashes, which was worse on the left eye Fig. 1. Punctate epithelial erosions also known as superficial punctate keratitis were seen diffusely on the right cornea worse inferiorly. On the nasal side of the left cornea, there was a perforated descemetocele corneal thinning down to the innermost layer of Descemets membrane measuring 8 mm by 6 mm with exposure of the uvea, as well as a suppurative corneal ulcer adjacent to the perforation temporally that measured 9 mm by 2 mm; the temporal edge of the cornea appeared hazy and edematous, without thinning. Visual acuity measured 20200 on the right tested with a visual acuity card held at a specific distance from the patients face and was graded as light perception on the left the patient could not detect hand motion but could tell when a flashlight was turned on or off. The right pupil was 3 mm in diameter, reactive to 2 mm, with no relative afferent pupillary defect; the left pupil was obscured by purulence. Extraocular movements were full. The intraocular pressure in the right eye was 13 mm Hg. On general physical examination, there were petechiae on the soft palate; follicular horny pap-ules, perifollicular erythema, corkscrew hairs, and nonscarring alopecia on the arms; and perifol-licular and nonfollicular purpuric macules and papules on the legs. A mental-status examination revealed lack of insight and a flat affect. The remainder of the examination was normal. The platelet count, red-cell indexes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, phosphorus, globulin, alanine and aspar-tate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and angiotensin-converting enzyme; toxicologic screening was negative. Other laboratory results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Dr. Javier M. Romero: Computed tomography CT of the head performed with the administration of contrast material revealed multiple sub-centimeter rim-enhancing lesions, predominantly in the submental subcutaneous tissue Fig. 2A; there was substantial fat stranding surrounding these lesions, a feature that most likely represented multiple fluid collections and raised suspicion for microabscesses. There was swelling and fat stranding in the medial canthus of the left globe. There was also left preseptal soft-tissue swelling associated with scleral thickening Fig. 2B. These findings were compatible with periorbital cellulitis and scleritis. CT of the brain without the administration of contrast material revealed mild soft-tissue swelling and fat stranding overlying the left eye. There was no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial acute infarction, or intracranial mass lesion. Dr. Heath: Vancomycin, cefepime, magnesium sulfate, potassium chloride, and normal saline were administered intravenously, and folate, thiamine, and a multivitamin were given orally. On the second day, testing for rheumatoid factor and antibodies to double-stranded DNA, Ro, La, Sm, RNP, and treponema syphilis was negative, as was testing for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies and antigen.

The patient had been well until approximately 3 weeks before admission, when vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, arthralgias, and episodes of epigastric pain of increasing frequency and severity developed, which she attributed to a viral gastroenteritis. Two weeks before admission, epigastric and midabdominal pain worsened, with diarrhea and one episode of vomiting. The next day, she came to the emergency department at this hospital. She rated the pain at 4 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain and reported that it was worse when she was lying flat. The blood pressure was 150/82 mm Hg, and the pulse 101 beats per minute; other vital signs were normal. The abdomen was soft, and there was mild epigastric tenderness without rebound; the remainder of the examination was normal. A stool specimen revealed occult blood. The red-cell indexes, platelet count, and blood levels of total and direct bilirubin were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram was normal. The patient returned home taking ranitidine, simethicone, and antacids. Three days later, upper endoscopic examination revealed a small hiatus hernia and was otherwise normal. Results of Helicobacter pylori antibody testing were reported as representing either infection or immunity; the blood level of haptoglobin was normal. Other test results are shown in Table 1. The next day, she was admitted to this hospital. The patient reported no history of melena or hematochezia. She had labile hypertension for which triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide in combination and metoprolol had been prescribed at different times and discontinued because of hypotension and gastrointestinal symptoms, respectively, hypercholesterolemia with normal lipid profile 2 months earlier, allergic rhinitis, and possible gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and she had had a urinary tract infection in the past. Imaging studies in the past had revealed ovarian cysts and bilateral pulmonary nodules, suggestive of old granulomatous disease. Medications included ranitidine, atorvastatin, and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. She had no history of allergies to medications. She was married, retired, and physically active. She drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. She had done no recent foreign traveling; her husband and friends had recently had transient gastroenteritis. The patients father had died at 72 years of age from esophageal cancer, a grandfather and a paternal aunt had had lymphoma, and maternal cousins had sarcoma and lung cancer; her mother and children were healthy, and there was no family history of renal or rheumatologic diseases. On examination, the blood pressure was 160/77 mm Hg, the pulse 89 beats per minute, and the temperature 37.7C; the respirations and the remainder of the examination were normal. Blood levels of haptoglobin, glucose, folic acid, vitamin B12, ferritin, phosphorus, magnesium, amylase, and lipase were normal, as were the results of coagulation tests; serum protein electrophoresis revealed a normal pattern, and im-munofixation showed no M component. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Review of the peripheral-blood smear revealed occasional reactive-appearing atypical lymphocytes. On the second day, a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration were performed. Pathological examination of the specimen revealed trilineage hemato-poiesis with normal morphologic features; a karyo-type was normal. A small, clonal B-cell population 3 of B cells expressing CD19 CD20 CD5 CD10 kappa was detected with the use of flow cytometry; immunohistochemical staining revealed scattered T cells, occasional B cells, and occasional polyclonal plasma cells. Serologic testing for celiac disease was negative, as was examination of the stool for H. pylori antigen, leukocytes, rotavirus, enteric pathogens, ova, and parasites. On the third day, the hematocrit fell to 24.5. The ABO blood type was O, Rh positive, with negative antibody screening and a negative direct antiglobulin test, and 2 units of red cells irradiated and leukocyte-reduced were transfused; the hematocrit rose to 30.4. The patient was discharged from the hospital. Two days after discharge, diarrhea developed, and 3 days later, anorexia, nausea, epigastric pain constant, rated at 7 out of 10, and recurrent bilious and occasionally blood-streaked emesis occurred. The patient took bismuth subsalicylate, but her condition did not improve. The next day, she returned to the emergency department. She reported fevers a temperature of 38.1C, with chills and diaphoresis. On examination, the blood pressure was 179/92 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, and the temperature 37.0C, with normal respi-rations and oxygen saturation. The abdomen was soft, with mild epigastric tenderness, without rebound or masses; the remainder of the examination was normal. The stool was black and positive for occult blood trace. Test results are shown in Table 1. Ondansetron and intravenous fluids were administered. Within 3.5 hours, the systolic blood pressure rose to 200 mm Hg, and the pulse to 94 beats per minute. The temperature later rose to 38.1C. Oxygen supplementation, ondansetron, antacids, oxycodone, acetaminophen, and irbesartan were administered. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed trace asci-tes and small pleural effusions. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Results of testing for antinuclear antibodies ANA and antibodies to double-stranded DNA were negative. The next day, renal vascular ultra-sonography revealed no evidence of renal-artery stenosis. Methylprednisolone 1 g daily, intravenously and labetalol were administered. Cyto-logic examination of the urine showed red-cell casts, hyaline casts, oxalate crystals, and no malignant cells. Culture of the urine grew few colonies 1000 to 10,000 of mixed bacteria. On the fifth day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Type II cryoglobulinemia with glomerulone-phritis, possibly due to an underlying B-cell lymphoma.

Strom Medicine: A 39-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of night sweats and abdominal pain. The patient had been well until 1 week before admission, when night sweats developed, which he attributed to the summer heat. Three days before admission, episodes of sharp abdominal pain developed; the pain was greatest at the costal margin on the right side, and the patient rated it at up to 7 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The pain lasted up to 2.5 hours, increased with deep breaths, was worse 1 to 2 hours after meals, and was associated with mild nausea, belching, hiccups, bloating, and loose, gray stools. The symptoms did not improve with simethicone or ibuprofen. On the day of admission, the pain recurred with increased severity, and the patient came to the emergency department at this hospital. Two weeks before admission, the patient had had a sharp frontal headache for several days after having traveled to a coastal region in the northeastern United States. He had had psoriasis since 10 years of age and, during the previous year, a few episodes of vertigo with ear fullness, for which he took meclizine, with improvement. A diagnosis of erythema nodosum had been made 3 years before admission, when he presented with raised, painful nodules on the shins and ankle pain; 1 month later, he had an episode of pain and erythema in the right knee a synovial-fluid aspirate reportedly showed low cell counts and negative cultures. He also had had cellulitis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, an appendectomy, a herniorrhaphy, and a turbinectomy. He reported no fevers, chills, chest pain, dyspnea, vomiting, melena, hematochezia, new rashes, or bruises. His only medication was topical clobetasol. He was allergic to trimethoprimsulfa-methoxazole and hydrocodone. He drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. He was married and worked in a medical facility. His mother had diverticulitis, and his father had hypertension. His siblings were healthy; he had no children. On examination, the vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. The abdomen was soft, without distention and with tenderness in the right upper quadrant. The spleen tip was palpable. There were matted, firm lymph nodes in the inguinal region and hyperpigmented, scaly plaques on the lower legs and waist; the remainder of the examination was normal. The white-cell count was 5800 per cubic millimeter reference range, 4500 to 11,000, with 73 neutrophils reference range, 40 to 70, 14 lymphocytes reference range, 22 to 44, 6 monocytes reference range, 4 to 11, and 7 eosinophils reference range, 0 to 8; the blood level of C-reactive protein was 9.7 mg per liter reference range, 8.0, negative for inflammation, and the blood level of angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE was 55 U per liter reference range, 8 to 53. The remainder of the complete blood count, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a urinalysis were normal, as were results of coagulation and renal- and liver-function tests and blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, amylase, and lipase. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, hepatitis C virus antibodies, and hepatitis B virus surface antigen was negative; testing for hepatitis B virus surface antibodies was positive. An electrocardiogram ECG showed normal sinus rhythm, with a borderline early-repolarization abnormality and T-wave inversions in leads V1 and V2. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed multiple rounded, hy-poechoic areas in the spleen, which was not enlarged, with no evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Dr. Victorine V. Muse: Computed tomographic CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained after the administration of contrast material, showed numerous ill-defined, hypoattenuating lesions, 1 to 2 cm in diameter, in the spleen Fig. 1, as well as bilateral, dependent atelectasis in the lungs. A hypoattenuating lesion in the liver, measuring less than 1 cm in diameter, was slightly increased in size from a study 8 years earlier and was thought to represent a cyst; small, nonspecific retroperitoneal and mesen-teric lymph nodes were also seen. A chest radio-graph showed an ill-defined opacity in the left apex, overlying the end of the first rib, and a rounded opacity in the left hilar region. An ultrasound examination of the legs revealed benign-appearing enlarged inguinal lymph nodes, the largest of which was 1.5 cm by 0.6 cm. Dr. Strom: The patients abdominal pain improved, and he was discharged on the second hospital day. Dr. Muse: At a follow-up visit 2 days after discharge, a CT scan of the chest, obtained after the administration of contrast material, showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy, with lymph nodes as large as 1.8 cm in diameter. The CT scan also showed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, an enlarged anterior diaphragmatic lymph node 1.2 cm in diameter, clustered nodular opacities within the lung in a perilymphatic distribution Fig. 2, multiple splenic lesions, a hypervascular lesion in the posterior right lobe of the liver, and a hypodense lesion 0.6 cm in diameter in the left lobe of the liver, which was thought to represent a hepatic cyst. Dr. Strom: Several days later, a diagnostic test was performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Non-necrotizing granulomas compatible with sarcoidosis.

Johnson Medicine: A 59-year-old-man was admitted to this hospital because of fever, confusion, thrombocytopenia, rash, and renal failure. The patient had been well until 3 days before admission, when vomiting, dia-phoresis, and increasing fatigue developed while he was traveling. The next day, the patient reportedly felt feverish and took ibuprofen and over-the-counter medications for influenza-like symptoms. During the afternoon and evening before admission, his family was unable to contact him by telephone. That night, his wife contacted emergency personnel, who went to the hotel where he was staying. They found him seated in his room, where he was nonverbal, unable to stand, but able to respond to painful stimuli. The blood pressure was 132/82 mm Hg, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94 while he was breathing supplemental oxygen at 2 liters per minute by nasal cannula. The pupils were 3 mm and nonreactive. The skin was warm. A capillary glucose level was 148 mg per deciliter 8.2 mmol per liter. An electrocardiogram ECG revealed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 132 beats per minute. Naloxone was administered nasally, but the patients condition did not improve. He was transported to another hospital. On examination at the other hospital, the temperature was 40.1C, the blood pressure 103/71 mm Hg, the pulse 130 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 36 breaths per minute while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared withdrawn and confused and thought he was in his home state of Nevada. The Glasgow Coma Scale score was 14 on a scale of 3 indicating coma to 15 indicating normal. Speech was slow. He obeyed commands. Toxicologic screening was negative. Reportedly, the hematocrit and white-cell count were normal, the platelet count was decreased, and the percentage of band forms was elevated; blood levels of sodium, potassium, chloride, and glucose were normal, the lactate level was elevated, and the bicarbonate level was decreased. Results of tests of renal and liver function were elevated. Testing for occult blood in the stool was positive. A chest radiograph was normal; computed tomographic images of the brain, abdomen, and pelvis, obtained without the administration of contrast material, reportedly showed no acute abnormality. A presumptive diagnosis of meningitis was made. Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, normal saline, and diaze-pam were administered intravenously, and acetaminophen was given rectally. Lumbar puncture was deferred because of thrombocytopenia. An indwelling urinary catheter drained 40 ml of amber, cloudy urine. Cultures of the blood and urine were obtained. The patient was transported to this hospital. On arrival at this hospital, the patient re-ported having little recollection of the previous week. Additional history was obtained from his wife. He reported feeling awful, with diffuse muscle pain, neck stiffness, and pain with swallowing, without headache or rash. He had gout; he took no medications before this illness and had no known allergies. He drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. The patient resided in the Southwest with his wife. He owned two dogs that were healthy and vaccinated. He enjoyed gardening, had gone hunting and walking in brush in Nevada 10 days before admission, and had traveled to Ireland 1 month earlier; on the day before the onset of symptoms, he had arrived in New England for business. He reported no recent dental work and no unusual exposures, such as tick or mosquito bites. On examination, the temperature was 36.1C, the blood pressure 125/81 mm Hg, the pulse 101 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94 while the patient was breathing supplemental oxygen at 2 liters per minute. He was lethargic, diaphoretic, and flushed and was unable to sit up. The first and second heart sounds were normal, without murmurs, rubs, or bruits. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft, without tenderness, distention, or organo-megaly. The skin was mottled, and there was a rash in a livedo pattern on the arms, legs, chest, and abdomen Fig. 1A and a purpuric rash on the hands Fig. 1B. The hands and feet were initially cold, and the muscles were diffusely tender. On neurologic examination, the patient was oriented, but his memory of recent events was impaired. He could follow only one-step commands. Speech was fluent, without paraphasic errors. There was diffuse, generalized weakness. Deep-tendon reflexes were mute in the ankle and otherwise 1 to 2, plantar reflexes were flexor, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Red-cell indexes and blood levels of phosphorus, magnesium, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, lipase, amylase, haptoglobin, and lactic acid were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. No intracellular or extracellular organisms were seen on examination of a peripheral-blood smear. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine; the specific gravity was 1.025, and the pH 5.5, with 1 bilirubin, 2 albumin, and 3 occult blood by dipstick. Examination of the sediment revealed 3 to 5 red cells, 3 to 5 white cells, few bacteria, very few renal tubular cells, and amorphous crystals per high-power field and 20 to 100 granular casts per low-power field. Screening tests for the human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 and antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi were negative. Four hours after his arrival, the patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit. Doxycycline, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin were administered intravenously, and platelets were transfused. Diagnostic procedures were performed, and diagnostic test results were received from the other hospital.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Infective endocarditis, cannot rule out Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

Cook Pediatrics: A 35-day-old boy was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit ICU of this hospital because of fever, vomiting, mottled skin, and severe anemia. The patient was born at another hospital, after an uncomplicated 37.5-week gestation, by cesarean section for breech presentation with a fraternal twin. His mother had received prenatal care, and prenatal screening tests for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, group B streptococcus, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis B virus had been negative; screening for immunity to rubella virus was positive. Placental membranes had ruptured less than 24 hours before birth, and antibiotic drugs were administered before delivery. The 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were both 9. The first hepatitis B immunization was administered to the patient before he was discharged. Two days before presentation, at a routine 1-month examination by his pediatrician, he was well, and the second hepatitis B immunization was administered. The day before admission, the patients mother noted increased fussiness, with pale and warm skin; one episode of vomiting occurred. On the morning of admission, tachycardia was noted and vomiting increased. On examination at the pediatricians office, the patient was pale, with mottled skin; the temperature was 38.6C. He was referred immediately to the emergency department of a second hospital. On examination, the weight was 3.61 kg, the rectal temperature 38.0C, the blood pressure 113/63 mm Hg, the pulse 172 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 64 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while he was breathing ambient air. He was pale, listless, and fussy, with mild suprasternal and intercostal retractions, without grunting or nasal flaring. The remainder of the examination was normal. A lumbar puncture was performed. Samples of the blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid were obtained for culture. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed dark red, cloudy urine, with a pH of 7.0, a specific gravity of 1.015, a large amount of blood, 100 mg per deciliter of protein, and trace leukocyte esterase by dipstick, as well as 0 to 5 red cells and white cells per high-power field and a small amount of bacteria, a moderate number of epithelial cells, and 15 to 20 granular casts per low-power field. Ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and a bolus of normal saline were administered intravenously, and a transfusion of leukocyte-depleted, packed red cells type O, Rh-negative was begun. Less than 4 hours after presentation, the patient was transferred to this hospital; en route, clindamycin, crystalloid solution, and the remainder of the red-cell transfusion were administered intravenously, and oxygen was given through a nasal cannula. The patient had previously been well, consuming both breast milk and formula. He lived with his parents, his twin, and an older sibling in a suburban, forested neighborhood, where the mother frequently walked. Approximately 2.5 months before the admission, the parents had vacationed on an island off the coast of Massachusetts; years earlier, they had visited the Caribbean, which has been their only international travel. The parents reported that they recently had upper respiratory tract symptoms; the family had a pet dog. On examination, the patient was crying vigorously and had pale and mottled skin. The temperature was 39.1C, the blood pressure 101/69 mm Hg, and the pulse 176 beats per minute; the respiratory rate was 68 breaths per minute, with supraclavicular, intercostal, and subcostal retractions, and the oxygen saturation was 97 while the patient was breathing 1 liter of oxygen through a nasal cannula. The anterior fontanelle was soft and flat, and there was no scleral icterus. A holosystolic-flow murmur, grade 26, was heard. The abdomen was soft, without tenderness or distention, and the spleen was palpated 2 to 3 cm below the costal margin. The arms and legs were mottled and slightly cool. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, phosphorus, ionized calcium, and cre-atine kinase were normal, as were the results of coagulation tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, a finding consistent with pulmonary edema, and a hazy opacity in the left upper abdomen, a finding consistent with splenomegaly Fig. 1. Results of ultrasonography of the head were normal. A transthoracic echocardiogram was normal for the patients age, with a patent foramen ovale and left-to-right shunting.

The patient had been in good health until 2 weeks before admission, when fatigue developed. Eleven days before presentation, he had moved to the United States from Indonesia. After his arrival, he had bloating and nonbloody, loose bowel movements, without fever, chills, vomiting, cramping, or abdominal pain. One week later, the diarrhea persisted and his exercise tolerance sharply decreased. The day before admission, he was seen at his local health center. Testing included a complete blood count Table 1 and stool examination. He was referred to this hospital for admission. The patient reported weight loss of approximately 4.5 kg in recent weeks, without dyspnea, night sweats, fevers, chills, rash, arthritis, cough, pruritus, alcohol intolerance, or hypersensitivity to insect bites. Two years earlier, the patient had presented with intermittent diarrhea, abdominal cramping, tenesmus, nausea, and weight loss 9 kg; there had been microscopic blood in the stool, and a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis had been confirmed by colonoscopy and biopsy. Symptoms had responded to treatment with mesalamine. Complete blood counts at the time of the diagnosis and 7 months before this admission had been normal. On his admission to this hospital, the patients medications included mesalamine 1.2 g daily and acetaminophen as needed for headache. He had no known allergies. He was born in India and had lived in Indonesia and Australia during the previous 25 years. He had traveled to a rural area in India in the previous month. He was married, reported being monogamous with his wife, and had no children. He had moved to the United States to attend graduate school. He was a vegetarian, drank alcohol infrequently, had a remote history of light smoking, and did not use illicit drugs. His parents and brother were healthy. There was no family history of cancer or autoimmune disease. On examination of the patient, the vital signs were normal. The spleen tip was palpable, and an erythematous papular rash was seen on the anterior thorax; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of creatinine, magnesium, total and direct bilirubin, amylase, lipase, uric acid, fibrino-gen, creatine kinase, vitamin B12, and tryptase were normal, as were the activated partial-throm-boplastin time and results of d-dimer testing; testing for total antibodies to hepatitis A virus was positive; and testing for hepatitis A virus IgM, antibodies to hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, and hepatitis B virus surface antibodies was negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was normal, and a chest radiograph was normal. Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed numerous enlarged mesen-teric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, as large as 1.4 cm by 2.2 cm by 3.1 cm. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of contrast material, was normal. Four days later, positron-emission tomography with the use of 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose 18F-FDG-PET revealed intense uptake of FDG throughout the skeleton and in an enlarged spleen, with low-to-moderate uptake in retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes. A CT-guided core biopsy of a retroperitoneal lymph node was performed, and the specimen showed reactive hyperplasia with increased eosinophils and plasma cells but no evidence of lymphoma on morphologic studies or flow cytometry. Stool specimens were negative for Clostridium difficile toxin, protozoa, helminth ova, and enteric pathogens. Testing was negative for antibodies to strongyloides, toxocara, trichinella, and human immunodeficiency virus HIV and for cytomega-lovirus nucleic acids. Cultures of the blood and urine were sterile.

The patient had been well until 3 weeks before admission, when headaches, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting developed, followed by anorexia and weight loss 7.3 kg. Evaluation at a student health center, including computed tomography CT of the brain, reportedly revealed no abnormalities. Three days before admission, photophobia, diplopia, neck stiffness, tremulousness of the left hand, and somnolence developed. On the day of admission, the patient became mute. Earlier that day, magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the brain and cervical spine was performed at another hospital after the administration of gadolinium, and a diffusion-weighted image reportedly showed hyperintensity in the cortex along the left frontoparietal region, as well as leptomeningeal enhancement most prominent along the basal cistern, pons, and cerebellum. He was transferred to this hospital. The patients history was obtained from his sister. Two months before admission, he had fallen while snowboarding and had possibly hit his head. He had had surgery at 11 years of age for eustachian-tube dysfunction. He was born in a refugee camp in Southeast Asia and possibly received vaccination with bacille Calmette Guerin; he immigrated to the northwestern United States at 5 years of age. He had traveled to Texas and the Middle East for military service more than 10 years before admission and to Texas 3 weeks before admission. His medications were an unspecified pain medicine for the headaches and suppositories for the vomiting. He had no known allergies. He was a student and lived with a roommate. He drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. While his mother was in a refugee camp, she had had a prolonged illness requiring multiple medications; his sisters were healthy, and there was no family history of autoimmune diseases or cancer. On examination, the patients vital signs were normal. He was somnolent but arousable by verbal stimuli. The neck was rigid. He was nonverbal but could write his name and current location and follow simple commands. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light from 4 to 2 mm, without a relative afferent pupillary defect, and there was no visual-field defect. He was unable to fully abduct the right eye on right lateral gaze. There was lower facial weakness on the right side. He lifted his limbs against gravity, without drift. The remainder of the neurologic and general examinations was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, platelet count, prothrombin time, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total and direct bilirubin, and C-reactive protein. Testing for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus HIV was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 64 beats per minute and ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads that were not thought to be clinically significant. Lorazepam was administered and resulted in some improvement in speech; levetiracetam was added. A lumbar puncture was performed; the results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the neurologic intensive care unit. Three sets of blood cultures were sterile, and three mycobacterial cultures of induced-sputum specimens were negative; one sputum culture grew yeast. Dexamethasone, ethambutol, isonia-zid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, pyridoxine, vanco-mycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, dalteparin, insulin on a sliding scale, and a 2-day course of ivermectin were administered. Dr. Pamela W. Schaefer: MRI of the brain was performed after the administration of contrast material Fig. 1. T1-weighted images show diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement that is most pronounced in the left frontal region and the basal cisterns. There is a focus of restricted diffusion in the left precentral gyrus, a finding consistent with ischemia. Results of magnetic resonance angiography were normal. Thin-section, gadolinium-enhanced images of the orbits, obtained on day 4, show leptomeningeal enhancement surrounding the optic nerves, which appear normal on T2-weighted images. Dr. Cai: On day 2, an electroencephalogram showed intermittent generalized background slowing, without epileptiform activity. Ophthal-mologic examination revealed blurred optic-disk margins, bilateral abducens palsies, and decreased visual acuity 20800 in each eye. On day 3, cef-triaxone and acyclovir were discontinued, and the administration of metronidazole and ceftazi-dime was begun. Liposomal amphotericin B was administered briefly and stopped because of a rash. A tuberculin skin test and an interferon- release assay QuantiFERON-TB Gold test were negative. Myringotomy was performed because of right-sided serous otitis media; cultures of the aspirate were sterile. A repeat lumbar puncture was performed. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid CSF disclosed no malignant cells, and flow cytometry showed no abnormal lymphocyte populations; other test results are shown in Table 1. On day 7, craniectomy and biopsies of the right frontal meninges and brain were performed and an external ventricular drain was placed. Pathological examination of the specimens revealed leptomeningeal fibrosis and reactive glio-sis in the cortex. Cultures of brain tissue and CSF were sterile. A test for antinuclear antibody was positive at 1:40 and 1:160 dilutions, with a speckled pattern; a test for hepatitis B surface antibody was also positive, and tests for hepatitis C virus antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, and antibodies to double-stranded DNA, Ro, La, Sm, and RNP were negative. The levels of IgG total and subtypes were normal. During the next 3 weeks, headache, nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite persisted; postural and intention tremors and visual hallucinations developed; and low-grade fevers occurred intermittently. Ethambutol and ceftazidime were discontinued, and the administration of moxi-floxacin, aztreonam, and trimethoprimsulfa-methoxazole was begun. On day 24, a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt was placed, and the external ventricular drain was removed. Blood levels of lactate dehydrogenase and haptoglobin were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Three days later, the diplopia and abducens palsies had resolved, the visual acuity had improved 2040 in the right eye, and 2030 in the left eye, and the optic disks were flat. Vancomycin and aztreonam were discontinued. On day 34, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility. His medications included rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, moxifloxa-cin, pyridoxine, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, a 3-week tapered course of dexamethasone, trazo-done, omeprazole, and ondansetron. During the next 2.5 weeks, he was walking and interacting, with less nausea and improved oral intake. Twenty days after discharge from this hospital, the headaches and tremors worsened and he walked less. Two days later, he was brought to the neurology clinic; on examination, he was alert and oriented, with decreased speech output and impaired attention and repetition the inability to repeat others speech. There was a subtle prona-tor drift in the right hand, moderate postural and intention tremors bilaterally, and a narrow-based stance and stride, with unsteadiness and leaning to the left side. The vital signs, funduscopic examination, and remainder of the neurologic and general examinations were normal. Dr. Schaefer: CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, reveals a 3.6-cm mass in the left inferior frontal lobe with irregular margins and central necrosis. Gadolinium-enhanced, T1-weighted images that were obtained the same day show peripheral enhancement of the mass Fig. 2. There are foci of susceptibility in the mass, a feature consistent with hemorrhage, neovascularity, or both. There is also restricted diffusion in the rim of the mass. T2-weighted images show a moderate amount of associated edema. There is persistent diffuse lep-tomeningeal enhancement. Dr. Cai: The patient was readmitted to this hospital, and a diagnostic procedure was performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Tuberculous meningitis with a paradoxical response to antimycobacterial treatment.

Moore Medicine: A 34-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of increasing dyspnea. The patient had been well until approximately 4 months before admission, when shortness of breath developed. Approximately 3 months before admission, she began to awaken at night with chest tightness associated with fever, coughing, and dyspnea on exertion. She was evaluated in the emergency department at another hospital. A chest radiograph reportedly showed abnormalities in the lower lobe of the left lung, and a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was made; oral antibiotics were administered. Increasing dyspnea and cough developed 2.5 months before admission. A fluticasonesalmeterol combination inhaler and an albuterol inhaler were administered, with minimal improvement. Three weeks before admission, computed tomography CT of the chest performed at the other hospital revealed a moderate pericardial effusion, prominent pulmonary arteries, and scarring in the lower lobe of the right lung. A 2-week course of prednisone was administered, with some improvement in cough and energy, with resolution of chest tightness, but with dyspnea, which occurred with minimal activity and increased at night requiring several pillows to sleep and occasionally at rest. Other symptoms included early satiety, decreased appetite, hoarseness, and leg swelling. She referred herself to this hospitals Womens Heart Health Program outpatient clinic because of her progressive symptoms and pericardial effusion. The patient reported cough productive of white mucus, dyspnea on exertion and when lying on her back, dry mouth for 3 months, heartburn and mild dysphagia, intermittent abdominal pain and diarrhea for 3 months, and hair thinning without alopecia. She also had had symmetric pains in her knees, elbows, and metacarpal and proximal interphalangeal joints for approximately 3 years, which were worse in the morning and had recently improved with prednisone therapy. During the previous 14 months, she had an intentional weight loss of more than 45 kg; during the past 4.5 months, she had a weight gain of 10 kg. She had had Raynauds phenomenon for 1.5 years, eczema since the age of 14 years, and anemia of uncertain cause. On evaluation the previous year, examination of a biopsy specimen of a left axillary lymph node had been benign. She had had cellulitis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA the previous year and herpes zoster three times in the past. Other daily medications included a multivitamin, vitamin D and iron supplements, and calcium acetate. She had taken phentermine in the past. She was allergic to penicillin, latex, and mushrooms. She was married, had children, and had lived in the midwestern and southern United States and New England. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had hyperlipidemia and thyroid disease, her father was deceased, and her children were healthy. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable and had a persistent cough while speaking, which worsened when she moved from a chair to the examining table. The blood pressure was 1581/20 mm Hg, the pulse 115 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while she was breathing ambient air. The height was 171.5 cm, the weight 91.6 kg, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 31. The jugular veins were distended to 10 cm above the right atrium while the patient was lying in a mildly inclined position, and heart sounds were distant, without murmur, rub, or gallop. There was cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, a swollen left proximal interphalangeal joint, leg edema to the knees, a violaceous macule 1 cm by 1 cm on the left inner thigh, and no cyanosis or clubbing; the remainder of the examination was normal. An electrocardiogram ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 115 beats per minute, right-axis deviation, left atrial enlargement, Q waves in the inferior leads, low voltage, and nonspecific ST-segment changes. Dr. Timothy C. Tan: Transthoracic echocardiog-raphy was performed. The parasternal long-axis view of the echocardiogram Fig. 1A reveals a mild-to-moderate pericardial effusion and thickening of the left ventricular walls, features consistent with concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular function was within the normal range. Color Doppler imaging shows the absence of aortic-valve and mitral-valve disease. The para-sternal short-axis view at the base of the heart reveals a dilated pulmonary artery and branches. Color Doppler imaging of the pulmonary valve shows mild regurgitation. M-mode imaging of the pulmonic valve Fig. 1B shows systolic notching, also known as the flying W sign, a feature that suggests pulmonary hypertension. The para-sternal short-axis view at the level of the midven-tricle Fig. 1C shows flattening of the ventricular septum, also known as the D sign, a feature that suggests elevated right ventricular pressures. The apical four-chamber view Fig. 1D shows an enlarged right atrium and right ventricle. The right ventricle was hypokinetic. Color Doppler imaging reveals mild tricuspid-valve regurgitation. The right ventricular systolic pressure was estimated to be 91 mm Hg. The echocardiogram also shows no physiological evidence of tamponade and no congenital lesions that may give rise to a left-to-right shunt. See Videos 1 through 4, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Dr. Moore: The patient was transferred from the clinic to the emergency department at this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 37.8C, the blood pressure 2011/47 mm Hg, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was able to speak in complete sentences. The complete blood count showed a red-cell distribution width of 18.1 reference range, 11.5 to 14.5 and was otherwise normal; the peripheral-blood smear revealed 2 anisocytosis and hypo-chromasia; the white-cell differential count, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and results of tests of coagulation and liver function were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, thyrotropin, troponin T, iron, iron-binding capacity, ferritin, vitamin B12, and folate; testing for troponin I, rheumatoid factor, and antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus HIV types 1 and 2 was negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed 2 blood and trace protein by dipstick and 0 to 2 red cells and few bacteria per high-power field and was otherwise normal; urine pregnancy testing was negative. The patient was admitted to this hospital, and additional imaging studies were performed. Dr. Amita Sharma: The chest radiograph shows enlargement of the right, left, and main pulmonary arteries Fig. 2A. A CT scan of the chest and a subsequent pulmonary CT angiogram confirm enlargement of the main pulmonary artery and no evidence of pulmonary emboli. The right ventricle is enlarged; the wall of the right ventricle is thick 5 mm, with flattening of the interventricular septum. The right atrium is di-lated, and there is reflux of intravenous contrast material into the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins. A small pericardial effusion is present. There is bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy but no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. The lungs are clear, with no evidence of interstitial lung disease or emphysema. The airways appear normal Fig. 2B, 2C, and 2D. A ventilationperfusion lung scan was normal. Dr. Moore: During the patients first 3 days in the hospital, metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide, and furosemide were administered; systolic blood pressures decreased to between 120 mm Hg and 140 mm Hg. On the third hospital day, diagnostic right heart catheterization was performed. Dr. Richard N. Channick: The right heart catheter-ization revealed severe pulmonary hypertension, with elevated right atrial pressure and markedly reduced cardiac output and mixed venous oxygen saturation, features indicating right ventricular failure Table 2. The pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure was normal, making left heart disease unlikely.

Micalizzi Medicine: A 45-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of a new rash. The patient had been well until 2 p.m. on the day before admission, when nausea, epigastric pain, and vomiting developed. The next morning, he was seen at another hospital, where he reported increasing asthma and right-sided back pain, which he rated at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain. On examination, he was in moderate distress. The temperature was 36.5C, the blood pressure 112/69 mm Hg, the pulse 125 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 35 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94 while he was breathing ambient air. The mucous membranes were dry, and he had scattered inspiratory wheezes, pallor and decreased skin turgor, and puncture wounds on his arms and hands. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was normal. Ipra-tropium and albuterol were given by inhalation, and famotidine, ondansetron, normal saline, metoclopramide, and methylprednisolone were administered intravenously; hydromorphone was then administered because of increasing pain. Dr. Connie Y. Chang: Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed at the other hospital after the oral but not intravenous administration of contrast material, did not reveal any findings of acute disease e.g., bowel distention or bowel-wall thickening to explain the patients severe pain and vomiting. The spleen appeared small, measuring 8 cm in the maximal craniocaudal dimension normal range for adults, 12 to 14 cm, with at least two granulomas. There was also mild enlargement of the caudate lobe of the liver. Dr. Micalizzi: Shortly after CT was performed, skin mottling and livedo developed, and additional history was obtained. Three days before presentation, the patient was bitten on his hands and forearms while bathing his dog; later that day, his wife washed the wounds with hydrogen peroxide. Levofloxacin, piperacillin, and tazobactam were administered at the other hospital. He was transferred to this hospital, arriving approximately 23 hours after the onset of symptoms. On presentation, the patient reported malaise, shaking chills, a burning pins-and-needles sensation in his limbs, and diffuse body pain that he rated at 10 out of 10. He had had head trauma caused by a rusty nail a few days before presenta-tion and dental extractions 1 to 2 weeks before presentation. He also had a history of asthma, mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anxiety, depression, chronic back pain, and alcohol abuse with recent consumption of up to 18 beers daily; he had stopped drinking 3 days before admission. His medications were citalo-pram and omeprazole daily, alprazolam as needed for anxiety, and albuterol and a combination of budesonide and formoterol, which were administered by inhalation as needed for asthma. He was allergic to codeine, and trama-dol had caused auditory hallucinations. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily and had done so for 30 years, and he had used illicit drugs in the past. He reported no recent tick bites or exposures to other animals, sick persons, raw oysters, freshwater, or saltwater. He lived with his wife and his dog, which was fully vaccinated. He worked sporadically and had recently installed air-conditioning systems. His parents both died at 72 years of age from myocardial infarctions. On examination, the patient appeared ill, anxious, and diaphoretic. The temperature was 35.6C, the blood pressure 1541/02 mm Hg, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while he was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, with normal bowel sounds and mild tenderness in the lower quadrants and without guarding or rebound. Diffuse, purple, blanching livedo extended over his arms and legs, there was some mottling on his flanks and abdomen, and his fingers and ears were slightly blue Fig. 1. There were numerous lacerations with necrotic edges and scratch marks on his hands and forearms; the largest mark on his right forearm 3 to 4 cm in length had a surrounding border 5 to 7 cm in diameter with a purplish tinge and without exudate, crepitus, or bullae. Capillary refill occurred in 5 seconds. The remainder of the examination was normal, as were blood levels of glucose, direct and total bilirubin, phosphorus, globulin, lipase, alkaline phosphatase, methe-moglobin, and haptoglobin; other test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph with poor inspiratory effort showed elevation of the left hemidiaphragm that did not have an obvious cause; there was no evidence of pneumonia. An electrocardiogram ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 132 beats per minute and low-voltage QRS complexes, with Q waves and ST-segment elevations 2 mm in the anterior leads. Vanco-mycin, cefepime, metronidazole, alprazolam, and 3 liters of normal saline were administered, and calcium and magnesium were given as needed. During the first 3 hours after presentation, the level of pain decreased rated at 4 out of 10; the respiratory rate ranged from 22 to 40 breaths per minute, and wheezing developed in the anterior lung fields. The rash progressed to involve the back, chest, and abdomen, with purpura that blanched in some areas. During the next 2 hours, the patient became increasingly confused, with delirium and periods of agitation. Additional test results are shown in Table 1. Etomidate and suc-cinylcholine were administered, the trachea was intubated, and positive-pressure ventilation was begun. Penicillin, ceftazidime, doxycycline, heparin, and hydromorphone were added, vancomy-cin was continued, and cefepime and metronida-zole were stopped. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed no evidence of hemorrhage, masses, or infarction. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit. Methylprednisolone was administered. Testing for antinuclear antibodies and antibodies to double-stranded DNA was negative. opacities and bilateral hilar fullness, findings consistent with pulmonary edema, as well as a pleural effusion on the left side Fig. 2A. Dr. Micalizzi: On the second day, the temperature rose to 39.6C. Dermatologic examination revealed diffuse, symmetric, coalescing, reti-form patches of purple ecchymoses and purpura involving most of the abdomen, chest, arms, legs, and face but sparing the forehead. The rash was predominantly nonblanching. Multiple discrete bite and scratch marks were present on the hands and arms; the largest was on the left forearm. The earlobes and fingers had a bluish hue, which persisted with elevation and warming, and did not have bullae, target lesions, mucosal involvement, crepitus, or exudate. Dr. Chang: Radiographs of the right hand and forearms showed soft-tissue swelling but noDr. Chang: A frontal chest radiograph showed soft-tissue gas Fig. 2B. Noninvasive vascular studies revealed thrombosis in the right radial vein; the results were otherwise normal. Dr. Micalizzi: The plasma ammonia level was normal, and testing for antibodies to hepatitis A, B, and C viruses and hepatitis B surface antigen was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration was begun. Clindamycin, meropenem, hydromor-phone, aspirin, omeprazole, ipratropium, and al-buterol by inhalation were administered, and vancomycin and ceftazidime were stopped. Trans-thoracic echocardiography was performed at the bedside and revealed a large wall-motion abnormality in the apical two thirds of the left and right ventricles. On the third day, rigidity and cyanosis of the right arm developed. Irradiated platelets, washed red cells, and additional fresh-frozen plasma were transfused. Narcotic analgesic agents and midazolam were administered for comfort. A diagnostic test result was received.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Sepsis due to Capnocytophaga canimorsus after a dog bite.

Flannery Medicine: A 59-year-old man was seen in an outpatient clinic at this hospital because of fatigue, abdominal pain, anemia, arthralgias, and abnormal liver function. The patient had been in his usual state of health until approximately 3 days before presentation, when epigastric distress and ankle edema occurred. He also reported increased personal stress, difficulty sleeping, dysgeusia, and nausea. On presentation in an outpatient clinic at this hospital, he reported epigastric pain that he rated at 6 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain and no weight loss. He had a history of asthma, pain and effusion of the right knee associated with a Bakers cyst, occasional swelling of the right ankle, and varicose veins. He had had normal results on colonoscopy 3 years earlier. His medications were pirbuterol by inhalation as needed for asthma and sucralfate as needed for stomach discomfort; he reported no use of nonsteroidal antiinflamma-tory drugs. He lived with his partner and worked in an office. He consumed two or three glasses of wine per night and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. On examination, the temperature was 37.3C, the blood pressure 110/68 mm Hg, the weight 81.8 kg, and the body-mass index BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 25.8. There was pitting edema of the ankles and superficial varicosities of both legs; the remainder of the examination was normal. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were normal, as were results of renal-function tests and blood levels of calcium, total protein, albumin, amylase, and alkaline phosphatase. Other test results are shown in Table 1 and revealed a new anemia as compared with test results from 4 months earlier, which included a hematocrit of 42 and a mean corpuscular volume of 88 m3. Review of a peripheral-blood smear revealed 1 polychromasia and basophilic stippling Fig. 1. A diagnosis of gastroenteritis was made, with possible peptic-ulcer disease and a bleeding ulcer. Omeprazole and sucralfate were administered, tests for blood in the stool and for antibodies to Helicobacter pylori in the blood were ordered, an upper endoscopy was scheduled, and a bland diet was recommended. The patient was instructed to follow up in 3 days, or sooner if his condition worsened.The next day, the patient called his doctor's office to report pain in both legs and increasing dysgeusia. He reported that his stools were looser than usual, without hematochezia or melena. The following day, 2 days after presentation, he was seen by his primary care physician in an outpatient clinic at this hospital. He reported increased abdominal pain, pain in the right knee and both shoulders, and fatigue that had lasted for at least 1 week. On examination, the temperature was 37.2°C, the blood pressure 131//89 mm Hg, the pulse 89 beats per minute, the height 177.8 cm, the weight 80.3 kg, and the BMI 25.4. The abdomen was normal, and the right knee was tender on palpation, with a mild effusion and no erythema; the remainder of the examination was normal. Stool obtained during a rectal examination was negative for occult blood. The patient scheduled a follow-up visit and returned home.That night, the patient presented to the emergency department at this hospital because of diffuse abdominal pain that was worse with eating and radiated to the left side of the chest, neck, shoulder, and back. Pain that was initially intermittent had become constant, and he had had constipation for 2 days. On examination, the blood pressure was 187//90 mm Hg; other vital signs, the oxygen saturation, and the remainder of the examination were normal. The blood level of lactic acid and results of coagulation tests were normal, and testing for antibodies to H. pylori in the blood and for blood in the stool was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones and was otherwise normal. Abdominal ultrasonography was normal. Oxycodone and ondansetron were administered. The patient was advised to avoid acetaminophen and alcohol, and he went home in the early morning hours. Later that morning, the patient returned to the hospital for an outpatient visit and rated the pain at 4 out of 10. He had hypoactive bowel sounds and periumbilical fullness, with no epigastric pain on palpation. The blood level of C-reactive protein was normal, and testing for antibodies to hepatitis C virus, antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and HIV antigen was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. The next day, upper endoscopic examination revealed a hiatal hernia, a nonobstructing Schatzki's ring at the gastroesophageal junction, and nodularity in the duodenal bulb. That evening, the abdominal pain markedly increased. The next day, 5 days after the patient's initial presentation, he returned to the outpatient clinic. He reported pain in the lower abdomen (rated at 8 out of 10), constipation that had lasted for 4 days, nausea with dry heaves, shortness of breath, and insomnia due to pain. On examination, he was tearful and writhing in discomfort. The temperature was 37.5°C, the blood pressure 129//80 mm Hg, the pulse 103 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The bowel sounds were hypoactive, and there was diffuse tenderness in both lower quadrants. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. The patient was transported to the emergency department at this hospital by wheelchair. On examination, he appeared anxious and uncomfortable. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, and he had discomfort on palpation in the lower quadrants. The blood levels of calcium, total protein, albumin, amylase, lipase, and lactic acid were normal, and routine toxicologic screening of the blood was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Radiography of the abdomen revealed a dilated colon, with findings suggestive of stool in the right and transverse colon to a transition point in the proximal descending colon. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of contrast material, revealed a large amount of stool in the cecum and no evidence of obstruction.

Cigarroa Medicine: A 41-year-old man with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL underwent allogeneic peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation, and afterward, fever and abdominal pain developed. The patient had been well until approximately 7 months before admission, when low-grade fevers and fatigue occurred; the fevers were associated with an unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 kg. Five months before admission, pain in his right arm and leg developed. Imaging performed at another hospital revealed deep venous thromboses, and analysis of a peripheral-blood smear revealed a white-cell count of 33,000 per cubic millimeter, with 53 blasts. Pathological examination of a bone marrowbiopsy specimen reportedly revealed 74 lymphoid blasts. A diagnosis of B-cell ALL was made, and cytogenetic analysis revealed the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome BCR-ABL translocation. Induction chemotherapy with a standard multidrug regimen, including cyclophos-phamide, daunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, l-asparaginase, and dasatinib, was administered. Six weeks after the diagnosis was made, follow-up examination of another bone marrowbiopsy specimen revealed morphologically complete remission. Two weeks later, the patient was seen in the cancer center at this hospital for a consultation about allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. He underwent consolidation chemotherapy while an HLA-matched unrelated donor was identified through the National Marrow Donor Program. Plans were then made to proceed with HLA-matched unrelated-donor peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation after myeloablative conditioning. Five months after the diagnosis of ALL and 3 days before the patients admission for the transplantation, pathological examination of another bone marrowbiopsy specimen revealed continued complete remission. One day before admission, a triple-lumen tunneled catheter was placed. The next day, he was admitted to this hospital. The fevers and fatigue that had occurred before the diagnosis of ALL had resolved. The patient had a history of low-back pain and intravenous opiate use. Maintenance chemotherapy, including 6-mercaptopurine and dasatinib, was stopped 2 weeks before admission; medications on admission included enoxa-parin and oxycodone. Palifermin was administered 3 days before admission, for prevention of mucositis. The patient had no known allergies. He had smoked cigarettes for more than 25 years and continued to do so, drank alcohol rarely, and stopped opiate use after receiving the diagnosis of cancer. He lived alone in New England, had one child, and was disabled because of this illness. He was of Native American ancestry. His mother and maternal grandmother had died; both had had lung cancer. The patients maternal aunt had breast cancer, and his father had multiple sclerosis. On examination, the vital signs were normal and the weight was 98 kg. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score was 1 on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating that the patient has no symptoms, 1 indicating that the patient is ambulatory but restricted in terms of physically strenuous activity, and 5 indicating death; the score on the Karnofsky performance scale was 90 on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 indicating that the patient has no symptoms, 90 indicating that the patient is able to perform normal activities with minor signs or symptoms of disease, and 0 indicating death. The abdomen was soft, without tenderness, distention, or organo-megaly. The skin of the right arm had numerous scars and chronic superficial thromboses, features that were consistent with previous intravenous drug use. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and total and direct bilirubin; other test results are shown in Table 1. The administration of allopu-rinol, famciclovir, ursodiol, and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole was begun, and narcotic analgesic agents were continued. During the first week, the patient underwent total-body irradiation and the administration of high-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide. He also agreed to participate in a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of antithymocyte globulin ATG, administered 3 days before stem-cell transplantation, for the prevention of chronic graft-versus-host disease GVHD ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01295710. The administration of fluconazole and ciprofloxacin as infectious disease prophy-laxis was begun on the day before transplantation, as was tacrolimus for the prevention of GVHD; trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole was stopped. On hospital day 9, HLA-matched unrelated-donor peripheral-blood stem cells were infused. As expected, pancytopenia occurred and persisted for many days thereafter; test results are shown in Table 1. Severe mucositis and diarrhea developed, and total parenteral nutrition was initiated for nutritional support. On hospital day 13 day 4 after transplantation and intermittently thereafter as needed, packed red cells and platelets were transfused. On hospital day 15 day 6 after transplantation, the temperature rose to 38.4C. Fluconazole was continued, ciprofloxacin and famciclovir were stopped, and intravenous cefe-pime, vancomycin, and acyclovir were begun; the fever resolved within 32 hours. Loperamide was administered for diarrhea. Episodes of epistaxis and melena occurred on hospital day 18 day 9 after transplantation and intermittently thereafter; aminocaproic acid was administered for the prevention of bleeding due to refractory thrombo-cytopenia, despite multiple platelet transfusions. On hospital day 21 day 12 after transplantation, the temperature rose to 38.4C, and fevers with associated episodes of confusion and hallucinations persisted daily thereafter. Fluconazole was stopped, and micafungin was started. The weight was 106 kg, and there was swelling of the face, erythema and ulceration of the throat and mouth, and edema of the arms and legs. A chest radiograph showed mild pulmonary edema and small pleural effusions. Test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were sterile. Furosemide was administered, without improvement. Four days later, abdominal distention and pain that was localized to the right lower quadrant occurred and was associated with guarding and rebound. Dr. Mahan Mathur: Computed tomography CT of the chest revealed patchy ground-glass opacity in the upper lungs, opacity in the right lower lobe suggestive of atelectasis, apparent esophageal-wall thickening, mild pulmonary edema, and trace bilateral pleural effusions. CT of the abdomen, performed after the administration of contrast material, revealed changes consistent with acute retrocecal appendicitis and inflammation of the cecum, as well as hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, periportal edema, free fluid, and innumerable subcentimeter retroperitoneal lymph nodes Fig. 1. Dr. Cigarroa: Surgical consultants evaluated the patient and determined that he had a very high operative risk, and conservative therapy was recommended. All oral intake was stopped. Metro-nidazole was administered; however, pain and signs of peritonitis worsened and fevers persisted. Blood cultures remained sterile, and testing of the stool for Clostridium difficile toxin was negative. The next day, the patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit ICU. On examination in the ICU, the temperature was 38.8C, the blood pressure 126/70 mm Hg, the pulse 109 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, the oxygen saturation 90 while the patient was breathing ambient air, and the weight 108 kg. He appeared uncomfortable and inattentive. The oral mucosa was erythema-tous, and there were ulcerations of the lips, oral cavity, and throat. The jugular vein was distended above the right atrium, and the jugular venous pressure was 10 to 12 cm of water. Breath sounds were decreased at the right lung base. Bowel sounds were normal, and the abdomen was distended and slightly firm to palpation, with tenderness to percussion throughout, rebound and guarding in the right lower quadrant, and tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant. There was 3 pitting edema to the sacrum. The rest of the examination was normal. The plasma lactic acid concentration was normal. Chest radiography revealed diffuse interstitial pulmonary edema. Supplemental oxygen and additional furosemide were administered; infusion of total parenteral nutrition was stopped. On hospital day 27 day 18 after transplantation, the temperature rose to 40.6C. The blood pressure was 139/94 mm Hg, the pulse 112 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88 while the patient was breathing ambient air. A repeat CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no substantial change. Because of the patients worsening clinical status, a diagnostic procedure was performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Acute appendicitis and neutropenic enterocolitis caused by a primary infection with an angioinva-sive mold, most likely aspergillus species.

The patient's severe mucositis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and persistent fevers suggest possible involvement of the gastrointestinal tract by GVHD.\n\n**Step 3: Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome (Veno-Occlusive Disease)**  \nThe patient has hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, periportal edema, weight gain, and ascites, which are classic signs of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome following high-dose chemotherapy and irradiation.\n\n**Step 4: Invasive Fungal Infection**  \nDue to prolonged neutropenia and immunosuppression, the patient is at high risk for invasive fungal infections such as aspergillosis or candidiasis, which can cause fever, pulmonary infiltrates, and abdominal symptoms.\n\n**Step 5: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Colitis**  \nImmunosuppressed individuals are susceptible to CMV reactivation. CMV colitis can present with abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, and can lead to colonic inflammation.\n\n**Step 6: Acute Appendicitis**  \nCT findings showed changes consistent with acute retrocecal appendicitis. The patient's abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant, and signs of peritonitis support this diagnosis.\n\n**Step 7: Drug-Induced Colitis**  \nMedications used during transplantation, such as high-dose cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin, can cause mucosal damage leading to colitis and abdominal symptoms.\n\n**Step 8: Relapse of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)**  \nRelapse of ALL could present with fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and cytopenias. Though less likely due to recent complete remission, it remains a consideration.\n\n**Step 9: Bacterial Sepsis (Gram-Negative Organisms)**  \nDespite negative blood cultures, the patient is at risk for sepsis from gram-negative bacteria due to neutropenia, mucositis, and central venous catheters.\n\n**Step 10: Clostridium difficile Colitis**  \nThe patient had prior antibiotic exposure and diarrhea; however, C. difficile testing was negative.

Gastrointestinal GVHD is highly likely given the timing post-transplant and symptoms of mucositis and diarrhea. Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome is also prominent due to hepatosplenomegaly, weight gain, and periportal edema. Invasive fungal infections and CMV colitis remain significant possibilities due to immunosuppression and persistent fevers. Acute appendicitis is a consideration but less likely as typhlitis can mimic appendicitis in neutropenic patients. Drug-induced colitis, relapse of ALL, bacterial sepsis, and C. difficile colitis are considered but are lower on the differential based on the clinical findings."}

The patient was born at another hospital by vaginal delivery after induction of labor at 38 weeks gestation because of oligohydramnios. The mother had received prenatal care, including obstetrical ultrasonographic testing, the results of which were reportedly normal. Serologic screening tests during pregnancy were reportedly negative. The prenatal course was uncomplicated. The mother took ondanse-tron for nausea and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and reported that there had been less fetal movement in utero as compared with her previous pregnancy. No meconium was present at delivery. The birth weight was 3.0 kg 25th percentile, the length 48.3 cm 25th percentile, and the head circumference 32.5 cm 10th percentile; the 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were both 9. The newborn was admitted to the neonatal nursery. The results of newborn auditory screening were reportedly normal. Tests performed at the New England Newborn Screening Program were negative. She was discharged home on the third day of life. She reportedly fed well and developed and grew normally. She smiled, laughed, and interacted socially, but she vocalized little. At approximately 4 months of age, the infants parents noted that she startled in response to loud sounds. At 6 months of age, she began rolling over from her stomach to her back and vice versa, reaching out for objects, and sitting with assistance. Her length was 69.9 cm 96th percentile, her head circumference 43 cm 72nd percentile, and her weight 8.5 kg 89th percentile. By 9 months, she could grasp objects and feed herself; however, her pediatrician noted that she sat only in the tripod position back bent slightly forward, and arms placed forward with the hands near the feet. Two months later, her parents reported that she sat only briefly and then flopped over and that she had stopped reaching for objects and feeding herself. At age 11.5 months, she was referred to the neurology outpatient clinic at this hospital. The infants parents reported that she often appeared tired and less alert than she had earlier in her life. She did not crawl or pull to stand. She consumed dairy-based infant formula and soft baby foods and had maintained expected trajectories on the developmental curves for height, weight, and head circumference. She smiled, made good eye contact, and responded to her name. She drooled frequently and made occasional mouthing movements. She did not choke or have trouble swallowing, she did not have constipation, and she did not have activity suggestive of seizures. She had had an ear infection at 4 months of age. Immunizations were current. She lived with her parents and her brother 3.5 years of age, who were well. Her mother was of Russian Jewish ancestry and her father of Irish and Italian ancestry. Her mother was gravida 4, para 2, spontaneous abortion 2. The family had traveled to the Caribbean and Italy. A paternal cousin had a mild speech problem; there were no other known neurologic conditions in the family. On examination, the infants facial features were nondysmorphic. The head circumference was 45 cm 50th percentile; the anterior fontanel was soft. Funduscopic examination was unsuccessful. There were two hypopigmented spots on her left thigh; examination with a Woods lamp was negative, revealing no evidence of neurocutaneous lesions. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. On neurologic examination, she was subdued, appeared alert, and intermittently startled spontaneously. Pupillary reactions were normal, and ocular movements were full and conjugate, with horizontal and vertical eye movements that tracked the examiners face, bright objects, and light, without saccadic intrusions or nystagmus. Movements of the infants face and palate were symmetric. There were no tongue fasciculations or macro-glossia. She smiled periodically, made brief chewing movements, puckered her lips, and drooled, but she did not vocalize. She turned her head to a bell ring. She opened her hands and moved her fingers. Her legs were extended tonically, with bilateral equinus foot posture plantar flexion and curled toes. When pulled to a standing position, she rose onto her toes. Muscle tone was increased, with rigidity; the heel cords were tight. The plantar reflexes were extensor; grasp and Moro reflexes were absent. A few unsustained beats of ankle clonus were present. In the prone position, she lifted her head briefly. Her head and neck drooped anteriorly when sitting. The asymmetric tonic neck reflex was incomplete. On testing of the parachute reflex abduction of arms, extension of elbows and wrists, and spreading of fingers, elicited when an infant is held in suspension in the ventral position and is tilted abruptly forward toward the floor, she fisted both hands and did not spread her arms. The blood level of aspartate aminotransfer-ase was 159 U per liter reference range, 9 to 80. Other test results, including blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bili-rubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine amino-transferase, and creatine kinase, were normal, as were a complete panel of plasma amino acids and urinary levels of organic acids. An electroencephalogram showed the absence of sleep spindles during a relatively prolonged stage N2 sleep a stage of nonrapid-eye-movement sleep characterized by sleep spindles, infrequent low-amplitude spikes in both centroparietal regions during sleep stage N2 of uncertain clinical significance, and no electrographic or electroclini-cal features of seizures. Dr. Otto Rapalino: Seven days after initial evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head was performed without the administration of gadolinium Fig. 1. The image showed mild diffuse hypomyelination that was most conspicuous in the deep and subcortical supratentorial white matter, with relative sparing of the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. T2-weighted images of the posterior thalami and lentiform nuclei showed a subtle increase in signal. The anterior thalami appeared mildly hyperintense on T1-weighted images and hypointense on T2 -weighted images. Single-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy MRS of the left frontal white matter revealed a slight decrease in the N-acetylaspartate-to-creatine ratio; the metabolite ratios were normal on MRS of the region of the left basal ganglia.

Gandhi Medicine, MGH: A 46-year-old woman with human immunodeficiency virus HIV infection was seen by a clinician in Botswana working in collaboration with members of a Massachusetts General Hospital MGH outreach program because of postcoital bleeding. The patient had been generally well until 6 years before presentation, when weight loss and pelvic pain developed and she requested HIV testing at a government clinic. HIV-antibody testing was positive. Four years 3 months before presentation, the CD4 T-cell count was 193 cells per cubic millimeter Table 1, indicating that the patient was eligible for antiretroviral treatment ART in Botswana. The white-cell count was 3400 cells per cubic millimeter reference range, 3900 to 8600, and the blood level of creatinine was 0.41 mg per deciliter 36 mol per liter; reference range, 0.45 to 0.81 mg per deciliter 40 to 72 mol per liter. Two months later, treatment with a combination of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and efavirenz was begun. At a follow-up appointment 1 month later, a gynecologic examination was performed to evaluate vaginal discharge, urinary frequency, and dysuria. Abnormalities were reported, and administration of a 10-day course of amoxicillin was begun. Pathological examination of the specimen obtained during a screening Papanicolaou Pap test revealed a low-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesion; however, the patient never received this result. Four months after the initiation of ART, the CD4 T-cell count had improved Table 1. One month later 5 months after the initiation of ART, the patient again reported dysuria; a course of nalidixic acid was administered. During the next 18 months, she continued to have recurrent pelvic pain, dysuria, and vaginal discharge. She sought care from traditional healers for these symptoms and postponed reporting the symptoms to her medical caregivers and undergoing a repeat Pap test, since she believed that the traditional therapies would help; the symptoms did not improve. Approximately 13 months before this presentation, the patient reported vaginal pruritus. Speculum examination revealed white patches on the cervix, and a repeat Pap test revealed a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. One month later, on review of the test results, colposcopic examination with biopsy was scheduled for the next available appointment, which was 14 months later. Approximately 10 months before this presentation, a small amount of vaginal bleeding reportedly occurred each time the patient had sexual intercourse; the patient was referred for gynecologic evaluation. One month before this presentation, the complete blood count, the cre-atinine level, and tests of liver function were normal; other results are shown in Table 1. She returned to the HIV clinic for evaluation. The patient reported no dyspareunia. She had undergone menarche at 15 years of age and first had sexual intercourse after the age of 17 years, and she was gravida 7, para 5. Medications included tenofovir, emtricitabine, and efavirenz; she had no known allergies. She lived in an urban area in Botswana with her five children and their father who was also receiving ART for HIV infection. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was employed periodically in a small shop. There was no family history of cancer. On examination, the abdomen was soft, without distention, rebound, or palpable masses. On pelvic examination, there were ulcers at the introitus; a malodorous, fungating lesion, 6 cm by 2 cm, on the right lateral vaginal wall, extending from the fornix to the introitus, with minimal bleeding on contact; and a nodular cervix. The remainder of the general examination was normal. Diagnostic procedures were performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Human papillomavirus–related vaginal cancer.

Kradin: A 64-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent pleuritic chest pain and a pleural effusion. The patient had been in his usual health until 3.5 weeks before this admission, when left-sided chest pain developed suddenly; it was not associated with exertion, was worse with inspiration, and was associated with dyspnea. He came to the emergency department of this hospital. He rated the pain at 4 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain and reported that it was unlike any pain he had had before. He had not had a fever or chills. On examination, there were decreased breath sounds on the left side. There was swelling of the right calf, with 3 pitting edema, which the patient described as chronic. The white-cell count and levels of d-dimer and troponin I were normal. Dr. Subba Digumarthy: A frontal chest radiograph obtained at that time Fig. 1A shows a left basilar opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm and blunting of the left costophrenic angle. These features are indicative of a left pleural effusion and atelectasis or consolidation in the left lower lobe. Computed tomography CT of the chest, performed according to the pulmonary-embolism protocol, reveals a small loculated left pleural effusion, with thickened and enhancing pleura Fig. 1B. There is patchy consolidation in the left lower lobe Fig. 1C. These findings could represent pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration, and associated empyema. There are scattered small indeterminate lung nodules, measuring up to 4 mm in diameter. There are no pulmonary emboli. An abdominal CT scan that was obtained 1 year earlier shows no left pleural effusion or thickening Fig. 1D. Dr. Kradin: Metronidazole and levofloxacin were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital 3.5 weeks before the current admission. Fluoroscopic studies revealed normal oropharyngeal swallowing with moderate intraesophageal retrograde flow, a finding possibly consistent with postprandial aspiration. A pneumo-coccal vaccine was administered, and previous influenza vaccinations were documented. Sputum cultures grew very few colonies of yeast and normal respiratory flora. Aspiration of the loculated effusion that was seen on the CT scan was not considered feasible. A mild cough and oxygen desaturation occurred intermittently. The chest pain subsided. The patient was discharged home on day 7, with assistance from visiting nurses for administration of his medications, including a 6-week course of clindamycin and levofloxacin, with possible extension of the course, depending on the results of scheduled follow-up imaging. Seventeen days after discharge, the left-sided chest pain recurred. The patient was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital. He reported that the pain was possibly increased with inspiration, and he rated it at 10 out of 10. He had had an intermittent cough, normal bowel movements, and no recent fevers, chills, chest pain, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, dys-uria, or hematuria. The patient had a history of hypertension, hy-perlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophageal spasm, and bipolar disorder and a remote history of alcohol abuse. He had been seen in the emergency department and admitted to the hospital on multiple occasions during the preceding 9 years because of atypical chest pain, with no evidence of myocardial in-farction; cardiac catheterization that had been performed 7 years before this admission had revealed stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery, which was treated with balloon angioplasty. His pain had been attributed to gastro-esophageal reflux disease and esophageal spasm. His medications were clindamycin, levofloxacin, metformin, metoprolol, albuterol and ipratropium solutions administered by nebulizer, citalopram, olanzapine, clonazepam, lamotrigine, nabumetone, gabapentin, enteric-coated aspirin, omeprazole, simvastatin, levothyroxine, folate, and a multivitamin, and he received oxygen by nasal can-nula at a rate of 2 to 3 liters per minute as needed. He was allergic to codeine. He lived alone, had a pet dog, and was receiving disability payments after previous employment in the retail and gaming industries. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily and had done so for 40 years, had stopped drinking alcohol 20 years earlier, and did not use illicit drugs. He had never traveled out of New England, had never been homeless or in jail, and had no known exposure to tuberculosis, asbestos, or inhalants. His father had died of cardiac disease and lung cancer, and his mother of meningitis. On examination, the patient was somnolent but easily aroused by verbal stimuli. The vital signs were normal, and the oxygen saturation was 96 while he was breathing oxygen by nasal cannula at a rate of 1 liter per minute. There were decreased breath sounds, expiratory wheezing, and rhonchi at the base of both lungs. The abdomen was soft, with mild tenderness in the left upper quadrant. The right lower leg was warm and erythematous, with 3 pitting edema. The remainder of the examination was normal. A complete blood count, urinalysis, and results of tests of coagulation and renal and liver function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, troponin I, and N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide. Toxicologic screening of the blood showed evidence of the patients medications and was otherwise negative. Dr. Digumarthy: A chest radiograph Fig. 2A shows a bandlike opacity in the right lower lung, a feature consistent with subsegmental atelectasis. The left basilar opacity and left pleural effusion are unchanged from the previous study. There are findings suggestive of interstitial pulmonary edema, including indistinct pulmonary vascula-ture, peribronchial cuffing, and hilar fullness. Noninvasive Doppler ultrasonography of the legs is negative for deep venous thrombosis. Chest CT, performed according to the pulmonary-embolism protocol, is negative for pulmonary embolism. The CT scan shows the persistent loculated left pleural effusion Fig. 2B and worsening of the patchy consolidation in the left lower lobe Fig. 2C and 2D. There is a new small right pleural effusion. The previously noted small lung nodules are stable. There is atherosclerotic calcification of the left main and left anterior descending coronary arteries. Dr. Kradin: The patient was admitted to the hospital. The medications he was taking as an outpatient were continued, and morphine for pain and vancomycin were administered. Grams staining of a sputum specimen showed moderate leukocytes, moderate gram-positive bacteria in clusters, and very few colonies of yeast. During the next 5 days, a sputum culture grew enterococcus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and two candida species. A tuberculin skin test was negative at 48 hours. Intravenous ceftriax-one was administered on day 3. A rectal culture grew vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. Induced-sputum specimens were negative for acid-fast bacilli.

The patient had been well until 10 weeks before admission, when a violaceous rash developed involving the eyelids, elbows, metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints, and knees. One week later, intense generalized muscle pain and weakness developed, including difficulty walking, arising from a squat, and climbing stairs. Two weeks later, examination at another hospital revealed a heliotrope rash a red-to-purple rash on the eyelids, periungual edema, erythematous papules on the fingertips, and moderate-to-severe weakness of the deltoids, triceps, hip flexors, hamstrings, and quadriceps bilaterally. Muscle bulk and tone, deep-tendon reflexes, and the sensory examination were normal. Electrodiagnostic studies of muscle and nerve reportedly showed evidence of a chronic proximal myopa-thy with inflammatory features. Prednisone, 80 mg daily, was administered, with transient improvement in weakness and a reported decrease in the serum creatine kinase level, from 6700 U per liter to 4200 U per liter. Twenty-six days before admission, the administration of azathioprine, 150 mg per day, was begun because of the patients progressive weakness including difficulty raising his arms and tenderness on deep palpation of the proximal limbs. Two days later, tests of coagulation and the blood level of total bilirubin were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Azathioprine was stopped after 2 days because of a rise in the creatine kinase level, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. Computed tomography CT of the chest and abdomen revealed a small left pleural effusion and anasarca. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI performed after the administration of gadolinium reportedly revealed enhancement and edema throughout the major muscle groups of the right thigh. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of skeletal muscle reportedly revealed mildly increased variation in fiber size and occasional degenerating fibers, myonecrosis, vascular injury, and fibrosis. Rituximab and a 5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin were administered. Anemia and hypertension reportedly developed. Red cells 6 units were transfused and antihypertensive agents were administered. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of the bone marrow showed normal trilineage hemato-poiesis and no malignant cells. Fever developed, and a possible pulmonary infil-trate was seen on chest radiographs; vancomycin and ceftriaxone were administered. On the 19th day, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation hospital. He had progressive weakness and was unable to ambulate. During the next 5 days, worsening cough and increasing sputum production developed. On the fifth day, a modified barium-swallow examina-tion reportedly revealed aspiration of thin liquids. Oral intake was stopped and a nasogastric tube placed. The next morning, respiratory distress developed while the patient was in a supine position; the oxygen saturation decreased to 68 while he was breathing ambient air from a previous level of 90. A chest radiograph reportedly revealed air-space disease in the left lower lobe and a small, left-sided pleural effusion. Furosemide, vancomycin, piperacillin and tazobactam in combination, transdermal nitroglycerin ointment, and oxygen were administered, and the patient was transferred to this hospital. Medications on transfer included hydralazine, fondaparinux, cycloben-zaprine, furosemide, metoprolol, and methylpred-nisolone. The patient had had a meniscal repair 10 years earlier. He was married and lived with his wife and two young children and worked in a service industry. He did not smoke or use illicit drugs. His father had hypertension, and two aunts had hypothyroidism; there was no family history of muscle, skin, or other autoimmune disease. On examination, the patient was alert, oriented, and afebrile. The blood pressure was 175/90 mm Hg, the pulse 128 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93 while he was breathing oxygen that was administered through a nonrebreather face mask at a rate of 10 liters per minute. Breath sounds were diminished at both lung bases, and there was no wheezing. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. There were ery-thematous papules on the extensor surfaces of the fingers, elbows, and knees and a heliotrope rash bilaterally. Nontender erythema of the peri-ungual regions was present. There was pitting edema of the arms and legs. Grip strength and the strength of foot dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were 45, and the patient was unable to lift his arms, legs, or head against gravity 25. Red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of globulin, total and direct biliru-bin, magnesium, phosphorus, calcium, N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide, and CA 19-9; direct and indirect Coombs tests and assays for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anti-mitochondrial antibodies were negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Normal saline, metronidazole, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin were administered. CT performed according to the pulmonary-embolism protocol showed air-space opacities and diffuse stranding in the superficial soft tissues, with no evidence of embolism. In the evening on the day of admission, hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure developed Table 1. The patient was sedated, the trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was begun. During the next 2 weeks, a tracheostomy was performed and the patient was weaned from respiratory support to nocturnal pressure-support ventilation. Serum immunoglobulin levels and protein electrophoresis were normal. Examination of a specimen from a second muscle biopsy of the right quadriceps muscle showed tubulo-reticular inclusions within endothelial cells, atrophy of type 2B fibers, and a small area of inflammation. A second 5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin was administered. Stools became guaiac-positive; endoscopic examination revealed two gastric ulcers, which were cauterized. Pathological examination of biopsy specimens from the lesions showed no malignant cells or dysplasia. Testing for Helicobacter pylori was positive; metronidazole and clarithromycin in a 14-day course and a proton-pump inhibitor were administered. Red cells were transfused intermittently, the levels of creatine kinase returned to normal, and the dose of prednisone was tapered to 7.5 mg daily. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation hospital on the 50th day, breathing 40 oxygen through the tracheostomy with a tracheostomy mask during the day and receiving pressure-support ventilation at night. He was able to sit on the edge of a bed with assistance and was lifted to a chair for chair rest. Prednisone was continued at 7.5 mg per day, and the monthly administration of intravenous immunoglobulin was planned. Seven weeks after discharge from this hospital, and approximately 6 months after the onset of symptoms, new erythematous macules and papules appeared on the torso, extremities, and face. Examination of the trunk, limbs, and face revealed discrete, erythematous macules and pap-ules that were too numerous to count Fig. 1. These lesions were characterized by central, white, atrophic and sclerotic centers, violaceous borders, and peripheral hyperpigmentation. A diagnostic procedure was performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Malignant atrophic papulosis (Degos’s disease) in a patient with dermatomyositis.

Jones Neurology: A 19-year-old woman was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit of this hospital in the autumn because of headache, fever, photo-phobia, neck stiffness, and mental-status changes. The patient had been well until 7 days before admission, when headache and nausea developed. She was seen at the emergency department of a hospital in Massachusetts 6 days before admission. The physical examination and laboratory test results were normal. Intravenous fluids and ketorolac were administered, with improvement. A diagnosis of tension or migraine headache was made, and she returned to her college dormitory. Two days later, the patient reportedly vomited and fainted after standing up. She returned to the hospital that night; examination revealed a temperature of 38.4C and was otherwise normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, platelet count, and results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal. Testing for mononucleosis, streptococcal pharyngitis, and influenza was negative, and urinalysis revealed blood that was consistent with menses. Intravenous fluids, ketorolac, metoclopramide, and ondansetron were administered, with some improvement. A diagnosis of possible migraine headache was made, and the patient returned to her dormitory. The next day, the fever persisted, and the patients parents, who had traveled from their home to be with her, administered amoxicillin obtained from relatives who were physicians and ibuprofen. The day before admission, another episode of syncope occurred, without head trauma, after the patient arose from bed. She went to the emergency department of another hospital that is affiliated with this hospital. The patient reported a bilateral parietal headache that was the worst of her life, fever, photophobia, chills, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, dizziness with position changes, neck stiffness that had lasted for 2 days, a mild sore throat, and no cough or abdominal pain. On examination, the temperature was reportedly below 37.1C, the blood pressure 97/64 mm Hg, the pulse 99 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while she was breathing ambient air; the remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal. Polymerase-chain-reaction PCR testing for nu-cleic acid from Babesia microti was negative, as were tests for Anaplasma phagocytophilum, ehr-lichia species, and antibodies against Lyme disease. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Lumbar puncture was performed; results of analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid CSF are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed a moderate amount of blood, with 5 red cells per high-power field 2 days after menses; a urine pregnancy test was negative. Testing of throat specimens for group A streptococcus and of nasal specimens for influenza A and B viruses was negative. A computed tomographic CT scan of the head, obtained without the administration of contrast material, was normal, as was a chest radiograph. The patient received 3 liters of normal saline administered intravenously over a period of 3 hours, diphenhydramine, metoclopramide, and ketorolac. She was admitted to the observation unit of the second hospital. Overnight, the temperature rose to 39.0C, and intermittent double vision and increasing difficulty with ambulation and urination occurred. In the morning, she appeared drowsy and was disoriented with respect to the year. She had neck stiffness, truncal ataxia, rotatory nystagmus, numbness of the face and right arm, and an inability to perform immediate recall of three words. The strength and sensation were normal. The urethra was catheterized, and 1 liter of urine was drained; an indwelling catheter was placed. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 57 beats per minute, a PR interval of 92 msec, and nonspecific T-wave abnormalities. Measurements of venous blood gases are shown in Table 1. Dr. Sandra P. Rincon: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head was performed after the administration of gadolinium and revealed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement Fig. 1A. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR images showed diffuse sulcal hyperintensity Fig. 1B; T2-weighted images showed subtle, ill-defined signal abnormality and mild expansion of the medulla Fig. 1C. There was mild effacement of the sulci that was suggestive of cerebral edema, but the basal cisterns were intact. Dr. Jones: Acyclovir 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 8 hours, ampicillin 2 g every 4 hours, meclizine, ondansetron, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen were administered. The patient was transferred to this hospital and admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. She had a history of headache, eczema, and oral fever blisters. Two weeks before admission, she reportedly had had a diarrheal illness. Before this illness, she had taken biotin for acne; her immunizations were current. She had no known allergies. She was of East Asian descent, was raised in the southern United States, and lived in a college dormitory in Massachusetts. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was not sexually active, had not traveled recently, and reported no exposures to sick persons, farm or domestic animals, raw meats or unpasteurized dairy products, or mosquito or tick bites. There was no family history of multiple sclerosis, sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, autoimmune disease, or connective-tissue disease. On examination, the patient was awake, alert, and oriented with respect to her name and her father but not the place or time; she answered yes or no to questions but often cried out in Chinese or with unintelligible words. The vital signs were normal. There was nuchal rigidity. Her eyes were open most of the time, with constant slow upward ocular movements and predominantly upward deviation. The right pupil was normal; the left pupil was difficult to assess because of ocular movements. She closed her eyes with equal strength and resisted opening them. A sensory examination, which was limited because of her fluctuating attention span and pain from nuchal rigidity, revealed decreased sensation on the left side of the face, decreased sensation to light touch on the right arm, intact sensation to light touch on the left arm, and withdrawal from a mild noxious stimulus to the legs. Her strength was 45 in shoulder extension antigravity with little resistance and 25 in hip flexion an inability to overcome gravity, with a greater decrease in tone in the left leg than in the right leg. The reflexes were brisk throughout, with two or three beats of clonus at the right ankle. The right plantar reflex was flexor, and the left plantar reflex was absent. Cerebellar testing was not performed owing to the patients overall neurologic status. Moderate palpebral conjunctival injection and shotty non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy were seen, and the remainder of the examination was normal. During the first 30 minutes after her arrival, the patients condition worsened; she was unable to follow commands and had increasingly slurred and nonsensical speech. She was transiently se-dated and paralyzed, and the trachea was intubated. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, red-cell indexes, platelet count, and results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of phosphorus, albumin, globulin, amylase, and lipase. Additional test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Rincon: A CT scan of the head, obtained without the administration of contrast material, showed no acute intracranial abnormality. MRI images of the head were also obtained without the administration of contrast material Fig. 1D, 1E, and 1F. FLAIR images showed diffuse sul-cal hyperintensity that had increased since the previous MRI examination. FLAIR images also showed diffuse signal abnormality in the cerebellum and effacement of the cerebellar folia, findings consistent with diffuse cerebellar edema. Diffuse effacement of the sulci had increased since the previous MRI examination, and mild effacement of the basal cisterns was present; these findings are consistent with cerebral edema. Magnetic resonance angiography of the in-tracranial circulation, performed with the use of a three-dimensional time-of-flight technique, revealed no hemodynamically significant steno-sis. MRI of the spine was performed without the administration of contrast material. T2-weighted images showed diffuse, ill-defined hyperintense signal abnormality and mild expansion of the spinal cord from the cervicomedullary junction to the conus medullaris Fig. 2A. The changes in the spinal cord are most prominent in the central gray matter Fig. 2B. Dr. Jones: An arterial catheter and a right femoral central catheter were placed. A solution of 20 mannitol 25 g was administered intravenously; ceftriaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir, and azithromycin were also administered. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Meningoencephalomyelitis, most likely due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae and less likely due to West Nile virus.

Robbins: A 65-year-old man with a history of emphysema and inflammatory colitis was admitted to this hospital because of dyspnea, hypoxemia, and worsening lung disease. The patient had been well until approximately 3 years before admission, when herpes zoster infection shingles occurred; shortly thereafter, episodes of bloody diarrhea developed, after which a diagnosis of inflammatory colitis was made at another hospital. Two years before admission, mesalamine was administered for treatment of the colitis, with improvement of his symptoms. During the next 2 years, progressive dyspnea on exertion occurred. One year before this admission, pulmonary-function tests were performed, and diagnoses of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD and advanced emphysema were made. Tiotropium bromide was administered by inhalation. During the 6 months before this admission, numerous episodes of worsening dyspnea occurred. Supplemental oxygen 2 liters per minute through a nasal cannula, as needed, multiple courses of antibiotics, and tapering courses of prednisone were administered, with transient improvement. Approximately 5 months before this admission, cough with sputum production developed. Dr. Carol C. Wu: A computed tomographic CT scan of the chest, performed at the other hospital, showed moderately severe centrilobular emphysema with bilateral lower-lobe basilar opacities, which may represent mild atelectasis, aspiration, or pneumonia. The main pulmonary artery was dilated, which can be seen in cases of pulmonary hypertension. Dr. Robbins: Three months before admission to this hospital, a stress echocardio-gram revealed fair-to-poor exercise capacity that was consistent with deconditioning, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 65, diastolic dysfunction, and an estimated pulmonary-artery pressure of 45 mm Hg. The patient traveled to Florida for 1 month and felt relatively well on his return. Approximately 7 weeks before this admission, dyspnea on exertion worsened; supplemental oxygen 2 liters per minute through a nasal cannula was administered. Dr. Wu: A CT image of the chest obtained according to the pulmonary-embolism protocol at the other hospital showed emphysema with bronchial-wall thickening and new tree-in-bud and small nodular and reticular opacities in the lower lobes, the right middle lobe, and the lingula. A new, irregular nodular opacity in the right lower lobe measured 1.8 cm by 1.4 cm. The findings were thought to represent aspiration or pneumonia. There was no evidence of pulmonary emboli. Dr. Robbins: Approximately 3 weeks before admission, dyspnea on exertion worsened and was associated with a nonproductive cough and temperatures to 37.8C; the patient became unable to walk short distances in his home. Prednisone, tiotropium by inhalation, mometasone furoate and formoterol fumarate dihydrate in combination, by inhalation, and azithromycin were administered, without improvement. Oxygen saturation on exertion measured 75 while the patient was breathing 2 liters per minute, and supplemental oxygen was increased to 4 liters per minute through a nasal cannula, 24 hours daily. The administration of levofloxacin was begun, and 2 days later, he was admitted to the other hospital. Medications at home also included metopro-lol, lisinopril, and gabapentin. On examination, the temperature was 36.8C, the blood pressure 119/73 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute; the oxygen saturation was 70 while the patient was breathing ambient air, and it rose to 95 with supplemental oxygen flow at 4 liters per minute. Examination of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds at the right base and diffuse wheezing in the upper lung fields. Blood levels of platelets, electrolytes, glucose, calcium, creatine kinase, and creatinine were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed occasional premature ventricular complexes. Dr. Wu: Posteroanterior and lateral chest radio-graphs showed new hazy opacities in both lungs, most prominently in the right middle lobe Fig. 1A and 1B. CT of the chest was then performed, which revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities Fig. 1C and 1D, with more severe involvement of the right middle lobe, right lower lobe, and superior segment of left lower lobe and less severe involvement of the upper lobes. The tree-in-bud and nodular opacities noted on the previous CT scan had resolved, a finding consistent with resolved pneumonia. There was no evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy or pleural effusions. No evidence of traction bronchiectasis or honeycombing was found, which would have suggested interstitial fibrosis. The heart was not enlarged. Dr. Robbins: Serologic testing, including testing for antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and rheumatoid factor, was negative. A blood test for galactomannan antigen was negative. Prednisone, gabapentin, mesalamine, ipratropium bromide by inhaler, albuterol sulfate by inhaler, and levofloxacin were administered. The patient remained afebrile and without sputum production. Two days before admission to this hospital, his respiratory status worsened. His supplemental oxygen needs increased to 80 oxygen through a face mask to maintain oxygen saturations between 85 and 90. Pred-nisone was stopped, and methylprednisolone and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole were administered. An echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function, an ejection fraction of 50, and a positive bubble study i.e., the injection of agitated saline showed evidence of right-to-left shunting across the interatrial septum. One day before admission, cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries, a mean pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure of 13 mm Hg, and a pulmonary-artery pressure of 39/20 mm Hg mean, 28, with no evidence of left-to-right shunting. On the ninth day, he was transferred to this hospital for further treatment. The patient had hypertension, hyperlipid-emia, and depression. Medications on transfer included methylprednisolone sodium succinate, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, levofloxacin, es-citalopram, gabapentin, heparin, metoprolol, pan-toprazole, mometasone, acetaminophen, and lor-azepam; he also was receiving 80 oxygen through a face mask. He had no known allergies. He was retired, having previously worked in sales. He lived with his wife and pet dogs and cats. Before this illness, he did yard work occasionally and had no known exposures to pet birds or hay and no occupational exposures, including asbestos. He drank two alcoholic beverages daily, did not use illicit drugs, and had smoked for 50 pack-years until stopping 8 months before admission because of dyspnea. His mother had COPD, and his children and grandchildren were healthy. On examination, the temperature was normal, the blood pressure 130/90 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. Breath sounds were diminished, without wheezes or crackles. Oxygen saturation was 67 on arrival, while the pa-tient was breathing oxygen 4 liters per minute through a nasal cannula; it rose to 89 to 90 with the administration of oxygen 10 liters per minute through a face mask, and approximately 2.5 hours later, it increased to 93 with the use of a high-flow face mask that delivered a fraction of inspired oxygen of 60. The remainder of the examination was normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 91 beats per minute, with occasional premature ventricular complexes and possible premature atrial complexes with aberrant conduction. Approximately 3.5 hours after the patients arrival, blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, globulin, and creatinine were normal, as were the platelet count and results of tests of liver function and coagulation; other test results are shown in Table 1.

Carruthers Neurology: A 68-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of diplopia of 2 days duration. The patient had a history of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, with chronic renal insufficiency. He had been in his usual health until 2 days before admission, when diplopia developed, along with nausea and vomiting, mild headache, and a sensation of unsteadiness while walking. The diplopia resolved when he closed the right eye. The next day, he remained in bed because of fatigue and a sensation of light-headedness when standing. Nausea persisted, without vomiting. On the day of admission, he noted weakness and clumsiness of his left hand while buttoning his shirt. At a scheduled follow-up visit, he was seen by his nephrologist, who noted dysconjugate gaze, with no other neurologic findings, and referred him to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient reported mild nausea and continued diplopia, whereby one image appeared above and to the right of the other with both eyes open; the diplopia had been constant since onset. He did not have headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, vertigo, weakness, numbness, fevers, or chills. He had had a chronic decrease in vision in the right eye due to a cataract, which had not changed. He had not had this combination of symptoms in the past. The diagnosis of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ANCAassociated vascu-litis consistent with granulomatosis with polyangiitis had been made 21 months before this admission. The disorder was characterized by sinus pain and renal insufficiency due to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis; a renal-biopsy specimen obtained at another hospital reportedly showed crescentic glomerulonephritis. The patients condition had improved after treatment with plasma exchange, methyl-prednisolone, and cyclophosphamide; 11 months before this admission, the administration of rituximab was also begun. His baseline blood creatinine level was reportedly 5.4 mg per deciliter 477 mol per liter. He also had hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, and a remote history of steato-hepatitis, bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphies, and laminectomies and lateral fusion between the third and sixth vertebrae of the cervical spine. His medications were rituximab an infusion every 4 months, predni-sone 7.5 mg daily, furosemide, amlodipine, meto-prolol, ranitidine, calcium carbonate with vitamin D, calcium acetate, sodium bicarbonate, dapsone, omeprazole, erythropoietin as needed, and topical mupirocin calcium cream. He was allergic to trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole which caused a rash, simvastatin, and azathioprine. He was married and retired. He drank alcohol in moderation, had a smoking history of 40 pack-years and had quit smoking 5 years earlier, and did not use illicit drugs. There was no family history of autoimmune disorders or neurologic diseases. On examination, the patient was fatigued but arousable. The temperature was 37.2C, the blood pressure 139/91 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93 while he was breathing ambient air. There was mild ptosis on the left side. His pupils and extraocular movements were normal. There was subjective diplo-pia in primary gaze, with greater vertical than horizontal separation. There was left-sided upper and lower facial weakness. Soft-palate elevation was diminished on the left side; tongue protrusion, voice, and hearing were normal. The left hand was held in flexion; strength was 45 mildly decreased in the left wrist extensors, 45 in the left finger abductors, and normal in the right arm. Dysdia-dochokinesia of the left arm was thought to be caused by weakness. There were fasciculations in the left calf. Plantar responses were flexor, with fanning of the toes. Gait was not assessed. The platelet count and results of coagulation and liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, and ammonia; other test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Dr. Michael H. Lev: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head Fig. 1A was performed without the administration of gadolinium because of chronic renal insufficiency. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR images showed mild, scattered white-matter changes, predominantly in the periventricular and subcortical regions, as well as in the midbrain region where there were more changes on the right side than on the left side. These findings are consistent with a chronic microangiopathic disease. Dr. Carruthers: On day 2, the temperature rose to 38.6C. Blood cultures were obtained and re-mained sterile. Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampi-cillin, and acyclovir were administered. A lumbar puncture was performed, and the opening pressure was normal. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Lev: On day 3, repeat MRI of the head was performed Fig. 1B and 1C. FLAIR images showed new, progressive, hyperintense punctate and linear cortical and subcortical foci bilaterally. There were some foci with restricted diffusion suggestive of infarction; these were most notable in the right cingulate, precentral, and postcentral gyri but also in the right midbrain, thalamus, and corona radiata and in the putami-na on both sides. Dr. Carruthers: Methylprednisolone 1 g daily was administered intravenously for 2 days. Hemodialysis was begun. Testing for antitreponemal antibodies was negative. On day 5, the patient became unresponsive during hemodialysis; the temperature was 38.8C, the pulse 90 to 99 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 92 to 94 while he was breathing supplemental oxygen at a rate of 4 liters per minute by nasal cannula. On examination, he was unable to speak and had impaired upward gaze. Measurement of arterial blood gases revealed that the pH was 7.52, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide 34 mm Hg, and the partial pressure of oxygen 81 mm Hg. Hemodialysis was stopped, and the trachea was intubated. The patient was transferred to the neurologic intensive care unit. Glucocorticoids were discontinued. Testing for hepatitis B and C viruses was negative. On day 6, the temperature rose to 39.0C. The thyrotropin level was normal; screening of the blood and urine for toxins was negative. A repeat lumbar puncture was performed; analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid CSF and other test results are shown in Table 1. Sputum cultures grew few colonies of yeast; cultures of blood, urine, and CSF remained sterile. Dr. Lev: Follow-up MRI of the head Fig. 1D revealed a new punctate focus of restricted diffusion in the right pons, along the corticospinal tract; FLAIR images showed new, diffuse hyper-intense signal in the cerebellar vermis bilaterally. Previously noted findings were unchanged or became slightly less conspicuous. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck revealed no evidence of stenotic or embolic disease. The next day, conventional angiography re-vealed no evidence of intracranial vasculitis. Computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed atelectasis and cholelithiasis but no evidence of cholecystitis. Dr. Carruthers: Transthoracic echocardiography revealed no evidence of vegetations. There was no evidence of vasculitis or viral infection on ophthal-mologic examination. Bacterial, fungal, and myco-bacterial blood cultures remained sterile, and testing for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus and for IgG and IgM antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, Bartonella henselae, and Bar-to nella quintana was negative. A tunneled hemo-dialysis catheter was placed. The administration of levetiracetam was begun. On day 8, the patient remained unresponsive, with a temperature as high as 38.4C. The morning cortisol level was normal; blood tests for IgG and IgM anti-bodies to eastern equine encephalitis virus and West Nile virus and a urinary histoplasma antigen test were negative. Additional test results are shown in Table 1. Valproic acid was administered. Dr. Lev: On day 10, MRI of the head Fig. 1E and spine revealed numerous new punctate cerebellar infarcts, without susceptibility changes suggestive of microhemorrhage. The spinal cord was normal, and the previously noted findings were unchanged. Dr. Carruthers: The next day, generalized fasciculations developed. Methylprednisolone 250 mg every 6 hours was administered intravenously. In consultation with the patients family, the goals of care were adjusted to comfort measures, and the trachea was extubated. On day 16, the patient died. An autopsy was performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Cerebral vasculitis due to granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

Ong Cardiology: A 40-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital 10 days post partum, because of dyspnea and hypoxemia. Ten days before admission, the patient went into labor at 39 weeks of gestation. A low transverse cesarean section and tubal ligation were performed electively at another hospital with the patient under spinal anesthesia, without complications. A healthy infant was delivered; the 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were 8 and 9, respectively. A tuberculin skin test was negative, and a tetanusdiphtheria acellular pertussis vaccine was administered to the patient. The patient returned home on the third postpartum day. She remained well until approximately 5 days before admission 5 days after the cesarean section, when gradually increasing orthopnea and dyspnea on exertion developed, associated with mild leg edema. Two days before admission, intermittent substernal chest tightness developed, associated with nausea, vomiting, and a cough productive of blood-tinged sputum but without fever or chills. The night before admission, she went to the emergency department of another hospital because of worsening dyspnea. On examination, the blood pressure was 140/74 mm Hg, the pulse 113 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air; the temperature was normal. The lungs were clear. An electrocardiogram ECG showed sinus rhythm at 130 beats per minute and possible left atrial enlargement, with no ST-segment elevation or depression. Blood levels of total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, calcium, alanine amino-transferase, and aspartate aminotransferase were normal, as were tests of renal function; other test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomographic CT angiography, performed according to the pulmonary embolism protocol with the administration of iopamidol, reportedly revealed an enlarged heart; small, bilateral pleural effusions; patchy air-space disease, with areas of patchy consolidation and thickening of the interlobular septa bilaterally; and no evidence of pulmonary embolism, aortic aneurysm, or pericardial effusion. Two hours after the patients arrival at the other hospital, marked anxiety and increased dyspnea developed. Lorazepam was administered, followed by heparin. The blood pressure rose to 2011/76 mm Hg and the pulse to 173 beats per minute, the respiratory rate was 21 to 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation fell to 64. Etomidate and propofol were administered, the trachea was intubated, and manual ventilation was begun. Approximately 200 ml of frothy, pink secretions were suctioned. Ten minutes later, the blood pressure fell transiently to 7643 mg Hg; the pulse was 111 beats per min-ute, the respiratory rate 31 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 81. During the next hour, succinylcholine, furosemide 40 mg, and mid-azolam were administered intravenously. One liter of clear urine was collected by catheter. The oxygen saturation was 90 with manual ventilation the fraction of inspired oxygen was not recorded; desaturation to 56 to 80 occurred when the patient was mechanically ventilated. Approximately 3.5 hours after arrival, she was transferred by ambulance to this hospital for admission. During transfer, she was manually ventilated; the blood pressure was 88/61 mm Hg, and the pulse was 136 beats per minute, weak, and regular. Seven years earlier, the patients first child was delivered at 40 weeks gestation by cesarean section because of failure to progress and fetal distress. The patient had had two spontaneous abortions, 16 months and 13 months before this admission. She had a history of Graves disease, carpal tunnel syndrome, anemia, and urinary tract infections. Medications before admission included ibuprofen, docusate, and methimazole, and she had taken micronized progesterone and propylthiouracil during the first trimester. She had no known allergies. She was born in South America and had moved to the United States 5 years earlier. She lived with her husband and children and worked as a housecleaner. She did not drink, smoke, or use illicit drugs. Her father had died at 60 years of age from myocardial infarction, her maternal grandmother had died of a stroke, her father and maternal grandmother had had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, as did her mother, and her sister had nephrolithiasis and asthma. On examination, the patient was sedated and intubated. She was breathing spontaneously and showed movement when examined. The temperature was 36.3C, the blood pressure 126/87 mm Hg, the pulse 164 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94 while she was breathing 100 oxygen. The skin was diaphoretic. Jugular venous distention could not be assessed. There were crackles at both lung bases, without wheezing. The heart sounds were rapid and regular. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, the surgical incision appeared clean, and the extremities were cool. Blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bilirubin, alanine ami-notransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, lipase, amylase, and thyrotropin were normal, as were results of tests of coagulation and renal function; testing for antinuclear antibodies ANA and antidouble-stranded DNA dsDNA antibodies was negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed 1 occult blood and trace albumin, with mucin in the sediment, and was otherwise normal; testing for urinary legionella antigen and human chorionic gonadotropic hormone was negative. Dr. Christopher M. Walker: A chest radiograph Fig. 1 shows an endotracheal tube with its distal end 2 cm above the carina. The heart is enlarged, and there is haziness over both costophrenic angles, indicating small bilateral pleural effusions. There are patchy opacities in the middle and lower lung zones, more in the right lung than in the left lung, findings that are most consistent with pulmonary edema. Dr. Ong: An ECG showed sinus tachycardia with nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. In the emergency department, a catheter was inserted into the radial artery. Furosemide a 40-mg bolus, midazolam, and fentanyl were administered intravenously. Approximately 2 hours after arrival, the blood pressure decreased to 61/35 mm Hg, and norepinephrine bitartrate was infused, with improvement to 81/61 mm Hg.

Byerly Medicine: A 41-year-old man was admitted to this hospital in midsummer because of fever, rash, pancytopenia, and abnormal results of liver-function tests.\nThe patient had been well until 6 days before admission, when fever with a peak temperature of 38.3C, fatigue, headache, and mild sore throat developed. Two days after the onset of fever, he came to the medical walk-in clinic at this hospital because of persistent symptoms. He also had atopic dermatitis, which had been treated intermittently with topical glucocorticoids. He had taken aspirin and acetaminophen for the fever, with transient improvement.\nThe patient had no known allergies. He was born in Europe and had moved to the United States 6 months earlier. He worked in an office and traveled frequently to Europe. Two days before the onset of fever, he had returned from a 3-week trip to Germany, Spain, Portugal, and the United Kingdom, during which he had gone mountain biking and hiking. He had not noted any insect bites. He drank alcohol infrequently, did not smoke or use illicit drugs, and reported sexual activity only with his wife, who was pregnant.\nOn examination, the vital signs were normal. There were tender lymph nodes in the anterior cervical region; the largest was on the right side and measured 1 cm in diameter. A rapid antigen-detection test for streptococcal pharyngitis was negative, and a throat specimen was obtained for culture. A presumptive diagnosis of viral pharyngitis was made.\nTwo days later, the patient returned to the clinic because of fever with a peak temperature of 39.4C, fatigue, malaise, arthralgias, diaphoresis, and mild headache; he did not have neck stiffness, photophobia, cough, or gastrointestinal symptoms, and his sore throat had resolved. On examination, he appeared mildly ill. The temperature was 38.9C, the blood pressure 117/79 mm Hg, and the pulse 102 beats per minute. The conjunctivae were pale and anicteric, and he had mild nasal congestion, a mobile left axillary lymph node 1 cm in diameter that was not tender, and bilateral anterior cervical lymphadenopathy with supple, small lymph nodes. There were multiple pigmented macules on his trunk that reportedly had been present for decades. The throat culture taken 2 days earlier was negative for group A streptococcus. Blood levels of glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, calcium, and total bilirubin were normal, as were results of renal-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed clear yellow urine, with 2 albumin, 1 blood, and 0 to 2 white cells and red cells per high-power field.'\nDr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: A chest radiograph showed a faint, patchy opacity in the left lower lobe that may represent pneumoniaFigure 1.\nDr. Byerly: After blood cultures were obtained and the administration of doxycycline was begun, the patient returned home. The next evening 5 days after the onset of symptoms, he came to the emergency department at this hospital because of fever with a peak temperature of 40.0C and a new rash on his torso that had appeared after the third dose of doxycycline. He reported decreased appetite and had stopped taking ibuprofen and acetaminophen because of gastrointestinal discomfort. He reported having received all recommended childhood vaccinations.\nThe temperature was 38.9C, the blood pressure 136/83 mm Hg, the pulse 95 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while he was breathing ambient air. Bilateral anterior cervical lymphadenopathy was present, as were multiple faint, nonpruritic macules on his upper chest, abdomen, and back. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Blood levels of total and direct bilirubin, phosphorus, and magnesium were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1.\nThe administration of doxycycline was stopped, levofloxacin was begun, and acetaminophen was continued. Overnight, during a febrile episode, the patient's oxygen saturation decreased to 93 while he was breathing ambient air; supplemental oxygen was administered. The next day, the temperature rose to 39.7C. Levofloxacin was discontinued because of the persistent fever, and the administration of ceftriaxone and azithromycin was initiated. Albuterol was given by nebulizer, and the acetaminophen was alternated with ibuprofen.\nAfter 25 hours in the observation unit 6 days after the onset of symptoms, the patient was admitted to this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 38.3C; other vital signs and the oxygen saturation were normal. There was a faint, small maculopapular rash on the chest, abdomen, and back; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures obtained 2 days earlier remained without growth.\nRed papules developed on the patient's forehead and face on the second hospital day and later spread to his arms; the rash was associated with a prickly sensation. The maximum temperature was 38.3C. Results of coagulation tests were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. A repeat chest radiograph showed that the patchy left basilar opacity had decreased in size from the previous study. The patient received prophylaxis with enoxaparin. The administration of doxycycline was restarted, azithromycin was stopped, and fexofenadine was begun.\nDuring the next 2 days, the patient's fever resolved and he felt better. On examination, a few petechiae were noted in the oropharynx. There was a diffuse rash with monomorphic, smooth, nonscaly, dome-shaped, reddish-pink papules 1 to 3 mm in diameter on the face, trunk, arms, legs, hands, and feet but not on the palms or solesFigure 2.\nDiagnostic tests were performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Measles", "predict": "### Step 1:\nViral pharyngitis\n\n### Step 2:\nInfectious mononucleosis\n\n### Step 3:\nEhrlichiosis\n\n### Step 4:\nCytomegalovirus infection\n\n### Step 5:\nAcute HIV infection\n\n### Step 6:\nHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis\n\n### Step 7:\nAdult-onset Still's disease\n\n### Step 8:\nAcute leukemia\n\n### Step 9:\nBrucellosis\n\n### Step 10:\nDrug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS syndrome)\n\n---\n\n**Reranked Differential Diagnosis:**\n\n1. **Ehrlichiosis**\n2. **Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis**\n3. **Acute leukemia**\n4. **Infectious mononucleosis**\n5. **Cytomegalovirus infection**\n6. **Acute HIV infection**\n7. **Adult-onset Still's disease**\n8. **Brucellosis**\n9. **Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS syndrome)**\n10. **Viral pharyngitis**"}

Krier Pediatrics: A 27-year-old man was seen in the outpatient endocrinology clinic at this hospital because of severe osteoporosis and multiple bone fractures. The patient had been born to a 23-year-old primigravida mother after 40 weeks of uncomplicated gestation. His mother noted that he had intensely blue sclerae at birth; physical examination was otherwise normal. The patients postnatal course was normal, and he was discharged home. When he was approximately 1 year of age, mild delays in speech and gross motor development were noted by his parents and pediatrician, including weakness of the leg muscles and poor body control. He began walking at 16 to 17 months of age and shortly thereafter had the first of multiple fractures. He had had more than 12 fractures before he started school, and approximately 20 fractures before he was 10 years of age; these fractures resulted from minor trauma, twisting injuries, falls, and collisions that occurred during typical childhood daily activities and play. During early childhood, mild cognitive impairment and speech difficulties were diagnosed and speech therapy was initiated. By the time he started elementary school, his language development had reportedly caught up with that of his peers, and he did not require additional speech therapy. He reportedly had mild cognitive challenges in school, for which he was granted extra time on tests and received special-education services, but he attended mainstream classes and graduated from high school. Ankle tendonrelease surgery was performed during childhood to improve the range of motion; contrac-ture of the left ankle persisted. Physical therapy was performed. A bone-mineral-density BMD assessment performed in childhood was reportedly normal. An evaluation by a geneticist at another hospital during the patients early childhood reportedly showed no evidence of chromosomal abnormalities. There was a clinical suspicion of the fragile X syndrome, but definitive testing was not available at the time. When he was in his 20s, the patient began participating in a sports activity program for youth with disabilities, and fractures occurred with an increased frequency; he had had a total of approximately 30 fractures by the time he was 27 years of age. Fractures predominantly involved the ribs, hands, feet, and ankles and did not include fractures of the long bones or compression fractures. Laboratory evaluation for secondary osteoporosis, performed at a second hospital, was reportedly negative. Four months before this evaluation, BMD assessment with the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry DEXA revealed severe osteoporosis. The next month, a 24-hour urine collection contained 120 mg 3 mmol of calcium and a normal level of creatinine; other test results are shown in Table 1. Approximately 1 month before this evaluation, a bone scan performed at another hospital reportedly showed increased technetium uptake in two ribs on the left side, as well as in the right ankle, left hindfoot, and mid-shaft of both tibias, findings that were thought to represent fractures. He was referred to the endocrinology clinic at this hospital. The medical history was obtained from the pa-tient and his mother. He had asymptomatic hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia, and vitiligo. He reported pain, which he rated at 2 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain, muscle cramps in his groin and knees on weight-bearing, occasional pain in his upper body, and occasional palpitations. In the past, he had had bleeding and infections of his toenails after self-induced trauma, as well as acid reflux. He had no history of hearing loss, joint dislocations, nephrolithiasis, eating disorders, lactose intolerance, or celiac disease. Medications included vitamin D3, atorvastatin, and levothy-roxine sodium. He had no known allergies. His diet included dairy products one or two glasses of milk daily and several servings of cheese per week and two to three cans of carbonated soft drinks daily. He exercised with light weights and a stationary bike; walking was occasionally limited by leg pain. He lived with his parents and a sibling, had graduated from a community college with an associates degree, and worked part-time in a service industry. He had casual social contacts through various hobbies. Although he had a few good friends in high school, he was not very social as an adult. He spent time in his room playing online games, worrying, and picking his toenails, which he described as an obsessive behavior. He did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His mother was of French Canadian and Native American ancestry and his father of Dutch and English ancestry. His maternal aunt had osteoporosis and had multiple fractures after 45 years of age after falls, his father had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, his maternal grandmother and uncles had diabetes mellitus type 2, and his sisters were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 125/86 mm Hg, the pulse 67 beats per minute, the height 167 cm 9th percentile, the weight 70 kg 70th percentile, the head circumference 56 cm 73rd percentile, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 25.1. The patient looked older than his stated age and had a prominent forehead, lower jaw, and nasal bridge, as well as a thickened nose and receded hairline. The teeth were short, wide-spaced, and discolored not opalescent, with some periodontal disease, and the palate and uvula were normal. The sclerae were pale blue. There was slight central obesity, some muscle wasting of extremities, and normal virilization and testes. The small joints of the hands and fingers had notable laxity, with a score of 2 out of 9 on the Beighton scale of hyper-mobility the two fifth digits could each dorsi-flex more than 90 degrees; the large joints were mildly contracted. There were patches of vitiligo, as well as hyperpigmentation that was consistent with sun exposure, with no pigmented striae or bruising. He had truncal hypotonia, mild kyphosis, and no scoliosis or vertebral tenderness. He generally spoke with a flat affect but had insight, made jokes at times, and expressed anxiety about being undressed during physical examination. The remainder of the examination was normal. Calcium supplementation and continuation of vitamin D supplementation and thyroid- replacement therapy were recommended. Exercise with weight-bearing and strength training was also advised. Two months later, diagnostic tests were performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Contiguous gene deletion involving COL1A1, resulting in osteogenesis imperfecta type I, and other genes possibly related to the patient’s complex phenotype.

Allegretti Medicine: A 37-year-old man with ulcerative colitis was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and hematochezia of 1 months duration. The patient had been well until 7 years before this admission, when gray stools with mucus and streaks of blood developed. During the next year, evaluation at another hospital led to a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Mesalamine 5-aminosalicylic acid was administered. Four years before this admission, he was admitted to another hospital because of a severe flare of ulcerative colitis. Colonoscopic examination confirmed clinically significant disease extending to the transverse colon, and histologic examination confirmed active colitis. Prednisone and mesal-amine were administered, and the patients condition improved. He declined additional immunosuppressive therapy, and prednisone was gradually tapered off. Approximately 3 years before this admission, the patient was seen in an outpatient clinic at this hospital because of increased stool frequency and hematochezia of 1 weeks duration. He reported that he had previously decreased the dose of mesala-mine and then had stopped it altogether for a total of 2 weeks because of acneiform lesions that he attributed to the drug. He then resumed taking the decreased dose of mesalamine. A tapered course of prednisone was prescribed. He declined azathio-prine treatment. During the next 2.5 years, symptoms of ulcerative colitis flares recurred, for which he sporadically took delayed-release mesalamine and courses of prednisone; 6-mercaptopurine was transiently administered but was discontinued because of elevated liver-function values. He declined antitumor necrosis factor therapy. The patient maintained a grain-free, lactose-free, and sucrose-free diet with probiotics. He was seen intermittently at an outpatient clinic of this hospital for follow-up visits for his ulcerative colitis; laboratory test results from 5 months before this admission are shown in Table 1. Approximately 2 months before this admission, fluctuating symptoms that were thought to be consistent with a flare of ulcerative colitis occurred, including abdominal cramping in the left lower quadrant, frequent liquid diarrhea with urgency, bloody stools, back spasms, and joint pains. The patient declined colonoscopic evaluation, but the fecal calprotectin level was elevated at 473 g per gram of stool normal value, 50. Twenty days before this admission, on follow-up evaluation at an outpatient clinic of this hospital, he reported partial symptomatic improvement with dietary changes, rest, and additional probiotics, and he noted that he was not taking other medications. He was reportedly allergic to penicillins and erythromycins. He asked about possible fecal microbiota transplantation FMT for the treatment of his disease flare; he was informed that FMT was an available therapy for recurrent Clostridium difficile colitis, but efficacy in ulcerative colitis was not proved. On examination, he appeared comfortable; the weight was 67.7 kg, and the remainder of the examination, including an abdominal examination, was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. He declined colonoscopy and 5-aminosalicylic acidbased medications, including enemas. Prednisone was administered. Fourteen days before this admission, the patient began taking an increased dose of predni-sone because of increasing stool frequency up to six episodes daily and persistent hematochezia. Two days later, he had a telephone consultation, and hydrocortisone enemas were prescribed; partial improvement was noted after 5 days. Three days before this admission, he reported fevers with a peak temperature of 38.1C, a stool frequency of four or five episodes per day, and hematochezia. On the day of this admission, the patient returned to the outpatient clinic because of persistent symptoms. He reported that he had urgent, frequent, bloody bowel movements up to 10 times daily, weakness, fatigue, decreased appetite, minor joint pains, left-sided abdominal pain not related to eating, weight loss of 4 kg during the preceding 3 weeks, drenching night sweats, and fever, with a peak temperature of 38.8C the previous evening. He revealed that he had performed home FMT with stool obtained from his wife and 10-month-old child on four occasions several weeks earlier. He had a history of iron-deficiency anemia for which iron had been administered orally and intravenously, low testosterone for which clomiphene citrate had been administered in the past, vitamin D deficiency, anxiety, seasonal allergies, and a positive purified protein derivative PPD skin test for which isoniazid had been administered in the past. Medications also included probiotics and vitamin D3. He lived with his wife and child and worked in an office. He drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke cigarettes or use intravenous drugs. He had traveled to Central America and South America in the past. He was of European ancestry. There was no family history of Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis. On examination, the patient appeared pale and thin. The temperature was 37.8C, the blood pressure 116/56 mm Hg, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 64.0 kg, the height 180 cm, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 19.8. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, with bowel sounds and mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of calcium, glucose, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were results of tests of renal and liver function; other test results are shown in Table 1. Methylprednisolone, normal saline, and iron sucrose were administered intravenously. On the second hospital day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Cytomegalovirus colitis and inflammatory bowel disease.

The acute onset of fever, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea aligns with bacterial enterocolitis.\n\n2. **Clostridium difficile colitis**\n   - Although the patient was not on recent antibiotics, the altered gut flora from FMT could predispose him to C. difficile infection. Symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, and frequent bloody stools are consistent with C. difficile colitis.\n\n3. **Ulcerative colitis flare-up**\n   - The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis with previous flares. However, the presence of high fever, significant weight loss, and night sweats are more severe than his typical flare-ups, suggesting an additional or alternate diagnosis.\n\n4. **Amoebic colitis (Entamoeba histolytica)**\n   - Exposure to amoebic pathogens through FMT is possible. Symptoms include abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and weight loss.

Symptoms include abdominal pain, fever, and bloody diarrhea.\n\n6. **Gastrointestinal tuberculosis**\n   - A history of a positive PPD test and prior isoniazid treatment suggests latent TB. Gastrointestinal TB can present with abdominal pain, weight loss, fever, and diarrhea.\n\n7. **Intestinal lymphoma**\n   - Presents with systemic symptoms like weight loss, night sweats, fever, and gastrointestinal symptoms. However, less likely without evidence of mass lesions.\n\n8. **Ischemic colitis**\n   - Typically occurs in older individuals but can present with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. Less likely given the patient's age and lack of vascular risk factors.\n\n9. **Colon cancer (colorectal carcinoma)**\n   - Chronic ulcerative colitis increases the risk of colorectal cancer. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, weight loss, and bloody stools.\n\n10. **Parasitic infection (e.g., Giardia lamblia)**\n    - Possible but less likely without typical symptoms like greasy, foul-smelling stools. The method of transmission through FMT could introduce parasites."}

The patient had been well until the day before admission, when fussiness, vomiting, and diarrhea developed, associated with decreased oral intake. He was taken to the emergency department at another hospital, where diagnoses of dehydration and gastroenteritis were made. He was treated with ondansetron, and intravenous fluids were administered. His condition markedly improved, and he was discharged home, with instructions to his parents to follow up the next day with a pediatrician. That evening, the patients parents noticed that the boy had respiratory grunting, increased work of breathing, progressive somnolence, and refusal of oral intake, without further stool output. The next morning, on the day of the current presentation, he was difficult to arouse and had recurrent vomiting and decreased urination. His parents took him to the pediatricians office, where he appeared lethargic, with rapid respirations; emergency medical services EMS were called. The patient was in respiratory distress, with grunting and labored abdominal breathing. The blood pressure was 134/70 mm Hg, and the pulse was 177, regular, and strong; the respiratory rate was 56 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 99 while he was breathing oxygen through a nonrebreather face mask. The skin was pale, warm, and diaphoretic; the lungs were clear, and the extremities were limp. The weight was 14 kg. The blood glucose level was 231 mg per deciliter 13 mmol per liter. The patient was transferred by ambulance to the emergency department at this hospital. The patients history was obtained from the parents through a foreign-language interpreter. The patient was born without complication after a full-term gestation and had previously been healthy. His immunizations were current; he was receiving no other medications and had no known allergies. He lived with his parents and 3-year-old brother, who had been ill recently with similar but less severe symptoms. The parents reported no other contacts with ill persons and no ingestions; there were pill bottles at home, but all were closed and in a childproof drawer. On examination, the patient was moaning and minimally responsive, with writhing movements and withdrawal from pain. The temperature was 38.2C, the blood pressure 124/76 mm Hg, and the pulse 172 beats per minute; hyperpneic Kussmaul respirations were variable at a rate of 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 98 while he was breathing oxygen at 15 liters per minute through a nonrebreather mask. The pupils were 3 mm in diameter, round, and reactive. The abdomen was distended and diffusely tender, with hypoactive bowel sounds. There were bounding pulses, with decreased capillary refill time. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Trace stool obtained on rectal examination was guaiac-negative. Monitoring and supportive measures were initiated. A bolus of normal saline was infused and was followed by an additional bolus because of hemodynamic instability. Blood levels of calcium, direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Ceftriaxone and ondansetron were administered, as were morphine sulfate for analgesia and lorazepam for agitation. Consultation with pediatric surgeons was obtained. A radiograph of the chest was normal; an abdominal radiograph showed mild, diffuse gaseous distention and no evidence of bowel obstruction or pneumoperitoneum, and abdominal ultrasonography showed no evidence of intussusception. Rapid respirations and moaning continued, despite analgesia and anxiolytic medications. A nasogastric tube was placed because of increasing abdominal distention, and some coffee-grounds material was aspirated from the stomach; famotidine was administered. In addition, an infusion of 5 dextrose in a solution of 0.45 normal saline and potassium chloride was started after the infusion of a third bolus of normal saline. Additional patient history was obtained, sodium bicarbonate was administered, and a diagnostic test result was received.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Salicylate poisoning.

The patient was born at another hospital after 39 weeks of gestation to a 36-year-old multigravida who had received prenatal care. Prenatal ultrasonography reportedly revealed mild hydronephrosis. Labor was induced because of maternal hypertension. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. On examination, microcephaly was noted; there were no dysmorphic features. The weight was 2.9 kg 13th percentile, the length 50.8 cm 60th percentile, and the head circumference 29.5 cm 1st percentile Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Results of the Massachusetts Newborn Screening Panel, which can identify more than 60 disorders, were normal. On the patients 18th day of life, radiographs of the head showed no abnormalities other than a small calvarium. Testing for toxoplasma and rubella was positive for IgG antibodies and negative for IgM antibodies; testing for cytomegalovirus was negative. At 3 weeks of age, he was evaluated by the genetics service at a second hospital because of microcephaly. His parents reported that he rolled his eyes when upset and had labored breathing after feeding but was otherwise well. On examination, there was microcephaly, the coronal ridges were palpable, and there were no other abnormalities. Array-comparative genomic hybridization testing revealed 16p11.2 duplication, which was thought to be benign. His infant formula was changed, and symptoms associated with feedings improved. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI that was performed when the infant was 6.5 weeks of age reportedly revealed a small brain, delayed myelination, and partial agenesis of the posterior corpus callosum. At 5 months of age, the patient was unable to roll over, constipation had developed, and his mother noted poor visual tracking. One month later, neurologic examination revealed pupils that were equal in size and reactive to light, decreased visual fixation, and failure to track. There was decreased truncal control, axial hypotonia, and near-normal tone in the arms and legs, which the patient could move normally. Muscle bulk and deep-tendon reflexes were normal; plantar reflexes were flexor. Neuro-ophthalmologic examination did not reveal optic-nerve hypoplasia. A diagnosis of cortical blindness was made. Genetic testing for the primary microcephaly syndromes was suggested. Twenty days before the current admission, episodes of head bobbing and perioral cyanosis occurred during feedings. Three days later, the patient was admitted to the second hospital, where he reportedly had episodes of respiratory distress with agitation or repositioning. On examination during an episode, he had near-agonal breathing with costal retractions and without tachypnea, an oxygen saturation between 80 and 89, head bobbing, grunting, back arching, limb extension, increased muscle tone, cool and mottled arms and legs, perioral cyanosis, and a decreased heart rate of approximately 75 beats per minute. The episodes occurred several times daily, resolved with oxygen administration, and when protracted, were followed by long naps. Growth measurements are shown in Figure 1 in the Supplementary Appendix, and laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography of the head reportedly revealed hypodensi-ties in frontal and parietal white matter, mild prominence of the ventricles, and extra-axial spaces containing cerebrospinal fluid possibly normal features for a patient of this age, with no acute hemorrhage, mass, or midline shift. Evaluation for gastroesophageal reflux revealed reflux below the level of the clavicles, without aspiration; an examination with a pH probe revealed no evidence of reflux during the episodes of cyanosis. An electroencephalogram showed slowing of the background rhythm, without evidence of seizure activity during an episode. Famotidine and lactulose were administered, and a nasojejunal feeding tube was placed. The patient was discharged on the seventh hospital day but was readmitted 2 days later because of recurrent episodes of respiratory distress and cyanosis. Oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula. Chest radiographs reportedly showed mild bronchial-wall thickening and low lung volumes. Testing for respiratory viruses was negative. Evaluation of the respiratory and upper gastrointestinal tracts reportedly revealed small diaphragmatic excursions, mild esophagitis, and reflux below the level of the carina, with slow clearing. The transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. On the 10th hospital day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. Medications on transfer included lactulose and lansoprazole. The parents reported that the patient was unable to roll over or sit up without assistance. He received infant formula orally. Immunizations were current, including one dose of seasonal influenza vaccine. He had no known allergies. He lived with his parents and older sibling and received early-intervention services. His parents were white, with no known history of consan-guinity. His mother had had two spontaneous miscarriages; his parents and sibling were healthy, and the maternal and paternal head circumferences were normal. His maternal grandmother had a bifid uvula, but the three-generation family history was otherwise unremarkable. On examination, the temperature was 36.2C, the blood pressure 116/55 mm Hg, the pulse 120 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 50 breaths per minute with deep subcostal retractions, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing oxygen at a rate of 1 liter per minute through a nasal cannula. The lungs were clear. On neurologic examination, the eyes were open when the patient was awake, with no tracking to visual stimuli, but the eyes closed in response to bright light and blinked in response to threat. The pupils contracted from 4 mm to 2 mm bilaterally, and a red reflex was seen. The face was symmetric, without facial diplegia. When the patient was in the supine position, the legs were abducted, the arms extended, and the hands fisted. There were spontaneous, symmetric, and antigravity limb movements. Head control and truncal tone were poor; he was unable to sit up without support and leaned toward the left. Pa-tellar reflexes were brisk 3, and there was sustained clonus at the left ankle and 5 beats of clonus at the right ankle; plantar grasp reflexes were present bilaterally. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, urea nitrogen, total protein, albumin, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, creatine kinase, triglycerides, thyrotropin, copper, and carbohydrate-deficient transferrin were normal, as were the anion gap and results of liver-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Lansoprazole, lactulose, lorazepam as needed for agitation, and glycerin suppositories were administered. On the first hospital day, the patient had two episodes of respiratory distress and cyanosis that were similar to previously reported episodes. The temperature was 35.3C, the blood pressure 98/50 mm Hg, the pulse 75 to 130 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 50 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while he was breathing oxygen at a rate of 3 liters per minute through a nasal cannula. Venous blood gas measurements are shown in Table 1. The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. Bilevel positive airway pressure was administered by face mask, with improvement. On the second day, apnea and cyanosis occurred intermittently. Otolaryngologic examination revealed incomplete vocal-cord adduction. Bronchoscopy revealed mild main-stem and lower-lobe broncho-malacia on the left side. A central venous catheter was placed in the right saphenous vein. Gabapentin was begun. Blood and urine amino acid profiles were reported to be normal selected values are shown in Table 1. Dr. Paul A. Caruso: MRI that was performed the next day, without the administration of contrast material, revealed pontomedullary hypoplasia, a diminutive corpus callosum, and a myelin disorder most consistent with hypomyelination. A sagittal T1-weighted image shows a diminutive pons and medulla, which can be best visualized when compared with an image of an age-matched normal brain Fig. 1. Although the diminutive brain stem may be in part explained by white-matter depletion, the findings raise concern for a component of malformation. The corpus callo-sum is diminutive; the anterior genu and body have formed but are abnormally thin, and the splenium appears deficient as it merges posteriorly with the hippocampal commissure and fornices. The white-matter volume appears reduced as compared with an MRI scan from an age-matched developmentally normal child Fig. 1. By 11 months of age, normal myelination usually results in low signal in parts of the supratento-rial white matter on T2-weighted imaging, but on this patients T2-weighted images, there was hyperintense signal abnormality Fig. 1, which suggests an underlying delay in myelination or a genetic myelin disorder. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed no abnormalities. Dr. Farh: On the ninth day, the patients work of breathing increased, and there was associated bradycardia. Swelling at the site of the central catheter was noted. The catheter was removed and cultured, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents were administered. Test results are shown in Table 1. The trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was begun. Cultures of the blood, urine, and catheter tip were negative, as were tests for respiratory viruses. Ultrasonogra-phy revealed thrombosis of the right common femoral vein. Low-molecular-weight heparin was administered subcutaneously. Dr. Caruso: Because of concern for an underlying disorder of myelination, the patient underwent magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the white matter on the 16th day. During this study, the conventional MRI revealed that thrombus had formed in the sagittal and straight sinuses and that the vein of Galen had become engorged Fig. 2. Dr. Farh: The administration of betaine, folinic acid, riboflavin, hydroxocobalamin, pyridoxine, and carnitine was begun. On the 20th day, a lumbar puncture was performed. The results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis are shown in Table 1. The administration of low-molecular-weight heparin at a dose of 200 U per kilogram of body weight twice daily was required to achieve a therapeutic level. Diagnostic test results were received.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Severe methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency. ", "predict": "1. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease  \n2. Leigh disease  \n3.

Geyer Medicine: A 39-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of a severe headache, nausea, and photophobia. The patient had been well until approximately 1 month before the current presentation, when a pruritic rash developed below the waist, most prominently on the left upper thigh. The rash was similar to transient rashes he had had in the past. Ten days before this presentation, he was seen in the urgent care clinic at this hospital for evaluation. On examination, there were pigment changes on the face and lower abdomen, scattered small papules involving the lower legs and wrists, purpura on the left thigh, and multiple scattered excoriations. A diagnosis of dermatitis was made, and he was referred to the dermatology clinic. On evaluation at the dermatology clinic the next day, he reported severe itching, including on his ears. He had not used any new soaps or detergents. On examination, there were geometric erythematous-to-violaceous patches and plaques, most notably on the abdomen under the belt buckle and on both legs in the location of the pants pockets, with depigmentation and prurigo nodules, and there was a low density of brown papules 2 to 4 mm in diameter over the trunk and limbs that were consistent with benign nevi. The remainder of the examination was normal. A diagnosis of severe contact dermatitis was made and was thought to be caused by coins or nickel on his clothing. A tapered course of prednisone was administered. Nine days later, at 4 p.m. on the day of admission, a headache developed in the patient that was unlike any pain he had had previously and that was associated with increasing agitation and restlessness. He self-administered ibuprofen, without improvement. He was brought to the emergency department at this hospital by his family. The history was obtained from the patient and his relatives. He rated his pain at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He reported photophobia and nausea, with no fever, neck stiffness, vomiting, cough, dyspnea, head trauma, or chest or abdominal pain. He had melasma and acne; he had had hidradenitis suppurativa and, during the previous 8 years, recurrent pruritic rashes predominantly around the waist and axillae that were associated with transient eosinophilia 910 cells per cubic millimeter 16; reference range, 100 to 300. Four years earlier, the patient had had a partial small-bowel obstruction and un-derwent resection of a Meckels diverticulum. Medications included prednisone and hydroxyzine hydrochloride, as needed for itching. He had no known allergies to medications. Vaccination history was not known. He was born in the Dominican Republic, had immigrated to the United States more than 15 years earlier, lived with his wife and children, and worked indoors in a service capacity. He spoke Spanish as his primary language. He drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. He had visited the Dominican Republic 2 months before these symptoms occurred. On examination, the patient was oriented to person, place, and time and was agitated and tearful, holding his head, and moaning. The temperature was 36.7C to 38.1C, the pulse 153 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while he was breathing ambient air. The mucous membranes were dry. The pupils were 4 mm in diameter and briskly reactive to light. The neck was stiff, with pain on flexion and rotation. Strength was 45 bilaterally, the gait was unsteady, and he was unable to stand without assistance. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, platelet count, and results of liver- and renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, and calcium; other test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial infarction, or intracranial mass lesion. A chest radiograph was normal. Blood specimens were cultured. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 132 beats per minute and was otherwise normal. Lumbar puncture was performed. Results of the cerebrospinal fluid CSF analysis are shown in Table 1. Grams staining of the CSF revealed abundant polymorphonuclear leukocytes and very few gram-positive cocci in pairs. Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir, magnesium, and metoclo-pramide were administered intravenously. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Rifampin, ondansetron, dexamethasone, and a narcotic analgesic agent were added, and acyclovir was stopped. During the first hospital day, fevers and chills resolved but headache and neck stiffness persisted.

Motola Gastroenterology: A 29-year-old man was seen in the walk-in clinic at this hospital because of diarrhea and weight loss. The patient had been well until 1 year before the current presentation, when diarrhea with loose, unformed stools developed; the diarrhea occurred up to six times per day and was associated with urgency and mild abdominal discomfort. During the 4 months before this presentation, unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 kg occurred and increasing fatigue developed. He had had no fevers, and the symptoms did not worsen after he ate dairy or wheat products. He had a history of asthma and had had excision of a congenital nevus and inguinal herniorrhaphy in the past. He took no medications and was allergic to penicillin. He was of Italian and Chinese ancestry. He had no known exposure to sexually transmitted diseases or hepatitis. He was single and worked in a retail store. His late grandfather had had hypertension, and his late father had had diabetes mel-litus, thyroid disease, nephrolithiasis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and hypertension; his brother and half siblings were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 1471/02 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, and the temperature 36.8C. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of vitamin B12, folic acid, electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, glucose, glycated hemoglobin, total protein, albumin, globulin, and free thyroxine T4; other test results are shown in Table 1. Testing for the human immunodeficiency virus antibody and p24 antigen was negative, as was serologic testing for celiac disease. After the test results were received, the patient was called and was asked to return to the outpatient clinic the next day. On examination, the blood pressure was 156/91 mm Hg, the pulse was 80 beats per minute, and the temperature was normal. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Testing for hepatitis B virus HBV surface antibody was positive, and testing for HBV surface antigen, core antibody, e antigen, and e antibody was negative, as was testing for hepatitis C virus HCV antibody. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Examination of the stool for ova and parasites was negative, and stool cultures showed normal enteric flora and no enteric pathogens. An appointment in the gas-troenterology clinic was scheduled. Three days after his first presentation, the patient noted increasing nausea and returned to the outpatient clinic. Dr. Dushyant V. Sahani: During that visit, color Doppler ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed mild splenic enlargement, with the spleen measuring 14.3 cm in length normal length, 12 cm. The liver was normal in size and echotexture. The liver vasculature including the portal vein, hepatic veins, and vena cava was patent and had a normal flow pattern Fig. 1. There was no free fluid in the abdomen. Dr. Motola: On follow-up evaluation in the gas-troenterology clinic, 3 weeks after the patients initial presentation, he reported recent early satiety and reddish stools with no frank blood. He reported dry skin but no pruritus, fevers, rash, oral ulcers, joint pains, or skin lesions other than multiple nevi. He had traveled to an island off the coast of New England 10 months earlier but did not recall having any tick bites. There was no family history of liver disease or inflammatory bowel disease. On examination, the vital signs were normal. The weight was 85.3 kg, the height 190.5 cm, and the body-mass index BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 23.5. The remainder of the examination was normal. Testing for mutations associated with hereditary hemochromatosis H63D and C282Y was negative. Three weeks later, esophagogas-troduodenoscopy revealed grade I varices in the lower third of the esophagus; the results were otherwise normal. Colonoscopic examination revealed normal mucosa. Random biopsies of the stomach, small bowel, and colon were performed, after which more bleeding occurred than expected. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimens revealed normal mucosa.

Kramer Medicine: A 50-year-old man with back pain, fatigue, weight loss, and knee swelling was admitted to this hospital because of abnormal findings on magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the spine performed at another hospital. The patient had been generally well until approximately 2 years before the current admission, when persistent pain of the thoracic and lumbosacral spine developed. Approximately 11 months before admission, he fell and had increasing back spasms thereafter, with partial improvement after chiropractic treatment. During the 2 months before admission, he lost approximately 10 lb 4.5 kg and his back pain became more severe; he rated it at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The pain was chronic with exacerbations, was localized in the thoracic and lumbar regions without radiation, worsened when he lay flat despite the administration of narcotic agents for pain control, and diminished with ambulation. Dr. William E. Palmer: On the morning of admission, MRI was performed without the administration of gadolinium at another hospital to evaluate the patients increasing symptoms Fig. 1. Fluid-sensitive images showed that the disk space between the 10th and 11th thoracic vertebral bodies T10 and T11 was filled with fluid, and there was prominent bone marrow edema involving T10 and T11. These findings raised diagnostic concern about the possibility of diskitisosteomyelitis or fracture with pseudoarthrosis. Dr. Kramer: The patient was advised to go to the emergency department at this hospital for evaluation. On arrival, he reported intermittent numbness in both feet greater in the left toes than in the right toes, but he had no shortness of breath, chest pain, leg weakness, or urinary or bowel incontinence. He had hypertension, nonischemic idiopathic cardiomyopathy with global hypokinesis, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, and fatigue with exertion. He had a history of obesity, depression, gout, nephrolithiasis, an adrenal nodule, and elevated results of liver-function tests, as well as one episode of iritis of the left eye 15 years before admission. He had also undergone numerous orthopedic procedures after traumatic injuries, including arthroplasty of the right knee and arthroscopy of the right ankle. The ankle symptoms, which included chronic discomfort requiring prolonged use of crutches, were thought to have exacerbated his back pain. Medications included lisinopril, furo-semide, atenolol, allopurinol, fluoxetine, acetyl-salicylic acid, and thiamine hydrochloride, with hydrocodone and diazepam as needed for back pain and spasms. He had no known allergies, drank alcohol in moderation, and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. He was married, had adult children, and had worked in a service industry until he became disabled by his back and ankle pain. He walked with the use of a cane or crutches. His father had had coronary artery disease. On examination, the blood pressure was 152/82 mm Hg; the other vital signs and the oxygen saturation were normal. There was tenderness on palpation over the paraspinal regions of the lower thoracic and upper lumbar regions, without pain over the spinal processes. The left knee was warm to the touch, and a small effusion was present. There was trace pitting edema bilaterally. Strength was normal in both legs, but there was mild loss of sensation of light touch in the toes. The remainder of the examination was normal. The level of C-reactive protein was 8.5 mg per liter reference value, 8.0, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 17 mm per hour reference range, 0 to 13. A complete blood count, a white-cell differential count, and results of tests of coagulation and liver and renal function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, and globulin. Oxycodone was administered for pain. The patient was admitted to this hospital, and diagnostic tests were performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Ankylosing spondylitis (HLA-B27–negative).

The patient had been in her usual health until approximately 7 weeks before this presentation, when pain developed in the right posterior region of her throat, which she attributed to recent dental work. Two weeks later, she went to another hospital because of persistent pain; a throat specimen was obtained for culture and amoxicillinclavulanate was prescribed. The throat culture was reportedly negative for pathogenic bacteria. On evaluation by her primary care physician at a second hospital four days later, she reported severe pain in the right side of the throat and odynophagia. The temperature was 36.6C, and there was purulent exudate over the right tonsil and cervical adenopathy on the right side. A repeat throat culture grew normal flora. Amoxicillinclavulanate was continued. Eleven days later approximately 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms, the patient was seen by a rheumatologist at a third hospital for routine follow-up of her seronegative rheumatoid arthritis, for which she was receiving various immu-nosuppressive medications, including methotrexate, antitumor necrosis factor  antiTNF- agents, and prednisone. She also had diabetes mellitus type 2, osteoarthritis, osteopenia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic anemia, and recurrent aphthous ulcers and had had colon cancer in the remote past which had reportedly been cured by partial bowel resection. She had no history of exposure to tuberculosis and had a negative purified protein derivative skin test. Medications at home included prednisone, methotrexate, infliximab, metformin, omeprazole, folic acid, and ferrous sulfate supplements, as well as acyclovir daily. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable. The blood pressure was 140/76 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute. There was prominent exudate at the right tonsillar bed and pain and decreased range of motion in her cervical spine and shoulders; the remainder of the examination was normal. The platelet count and results of liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of creatinine, total protein, albumin, and globulin; other test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was advised to decrease her daily dose of prednisone, and planned doses of meth-otrexate and infliximab were withheld. The following day, on examination by her primary care physician, the temperature was 36.3C and there was persistent right tonsillar exudate. Azithro-mycin was prescribed. Three days later, the patient was seen in the emergency department at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary because of persistent odynopha-gia. She reported pain on the right side of her throat, which she rated at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain, and headache. The pain did not radiate. She reported no fevers, chills, night sweats, malaise, or facial swelling. Otolaryngologic examination revealed numerous shallow ulcerations that were consistent with broken vesicles on the right tonsil. The mucous membranes were moist and pink, the salivary secretions were clear, and the floor of the mouth and the tongue were soft and non-tender on palpation. There was no trismus, ery-thema, or pus in the posterior pharynx. Endoscopic examination revealed minimally edematous turbinates in the nasal cavity, shallow ulcerations along the posterior tonsillar wall, and erythema of the right arytenoid complex with overlying shallow ulcerations to the midline. Oxycodoneacetaminophen was administered. The patient returned home, with instructions to return for a follow-up visit in 1 week. Four days later, on repeat evaluation by her rheumatolo-gist, she reported no relief in her throat pain and odynophagia, despite taking narcotic analgesic agents. The temperature was 36.6C. The right tonsillar bed and right posterior pharynx were ulcerated and covered with gray exudate. The otolaryngologist was contacted and recommended administration of a short course of prednisone at a dose of 50 mg per day. Three days later, she returned to the emer-gency department at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary for a scheduled follow-up visit. She reported persistent pain, which she rated at 10 out of 10, and associated decreasing oral intake. On endoscopic examination, there was decreased exudate on the right tonsil as compared with the amount of exudate seen on the previous examination, as well as resolving mucosal lesions on the posterior oropharyngeal wall and substantial improvement of the mucosal lesion on the right aryepiglottic fold. Prednisone was continued at a dose of 50 mg daily for 5 days and then decreased to a dose of 10 mg daily, and viscous lidocaine mouthwash was added. One week later 2 weeks after her initial presentation at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, the patient returned for follow-up in the emergency department, as advised. On examination, the temperature was 36.1C and the other vital signs were normal. The right tonsil had persistent ulceration and was firm on palpation. Fiberoptic otolaryngoscopy revealed a tonsillar mass and ulcer extending along the right pharyngeal wall to the aryepiglottic fold, as well as persistent white exudate over the right aryepi-glottic fold. An appointment in the head and neck clinic was scheduled for 3 days later. In the clinic, the patient reported burning pain which she rated at 10 out of 10, pain on swallowing, a globus sensation in the right side of her throat, weight loss of 4.5 to 5 kg since the onset of symptoms, and weakness. An ulcer extended along the right posterior pharyngeal wall to the larynx. The vocal cords were mobile and symmetric bilaterally. The following day, the patient was admitted to this hospital. Medications on admission included prednisone, oxycodone acetaminophen, omeprazole, glyburide, metfor-min, acyclovir, simvastatin, lisinopril, aspirin, amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, calcium, and vitamin D. The patient was widowed and lived alone, with her adult children living nearby. She was born in South America and had last visited 15 years earlier. She had traveled to a rural area in New England 3 months before this admission and had worked in a garden in that area for several days. She had no exposures to sick people, pets, or other animals. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There was no family history of head or neck cancer. The platelet count and results of coagulation and renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, calcium, and magnesium; other test results are shown in Table 1. Intravenous fluids were administered. Dr. Amy F. Juliano: Computed tomography CT of the neck, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed abnormally thickened and enhancing soft tissue around the right glossotonsillar sulcus, extending to the right palatine tonsil Fig. 1A. The thickened soft tissue continued inferiorly, involving the right lateral pharyngeal wall Fig. 1B, and extended to the right aspect of the epiglottis Fig. 1C and the right aryepiglottic fold Fig. 1D. Asymmetrically prominent lymph nodes were present in the right side of the neck Fig. 1E. A few lymph nodes were slightly irregular, with hazy margins. Dr. Sen: Glucose levels ranged from normal values to 263 mg per deciliter 14.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 67 to 106 mg per deciliter 3.7 to 5.9 mmol per liter, and insulin was administered on a sliding scale, as needed. On the third day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Oropharyngeal and laryngeal histoplasmosis. This case was discussed at Medical Grand Rounds.

Brezina Hematology: A 60-year-old man was seen in the outpatient cancer center at this hospital because of bone pain and skeletal lesions on imaging. The patient had been well until approximately 2 months before this evaluation, when he had a gradual onset of pain in the back of his neck and shoulders, which was followed later by a sharp pain in the middle of his back that began suddenly after sneezing. The pain increased after exercise and did not decrease with physical therapy, massage therapy, or a course of prednisone. Dr. Ambrose J. Huang: One month before this evaluation, computed tomography CT of the chest that was performed at another hospital revealed numerous lytic lesions in the thoracic spine and pathologic compression fractures of T5 and T7 Fig. 1. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the lumbar spine with short-tau inversion recovery STIR parameters also performed at the other hospital at that time revealed numerous lesions with high signal intensity involving the vertebral bodies and posterior elements Fig. 2. Nurse Practitioner Brezina: Pathological examination of a bone marrowbiopsy specimen that was obtained at that time reportedly revealed mildly hypocellular bone marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis. Immunoperoxidase stains for CD34, CD117, CD3, CD20, and CD138 and in situ hybridization for kappa and lambda light chains showed no abnormal cells. Examination of the bone marrow aspirate revealed maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and scattered mast cells, including occasional cells with an atypical spindle-shaped appearance. Flow cyto-metric and cytogenetic analysis showed a normal male karyotype; fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH testing for a CHIC2 deletion associated with FIP1L1 PDGFRA fusion was negative. A narcotic analgesic agent was administered. The level of prostate-specific antigen PSA was 2.9 ng per milliliter. One week later, a CT-guided biopsy of a lesion in the iliac crest was performed, and examination of the specimen reportedly revealed slightly hypocellular marrow and a mildly increased number of CD117 mast cells, including spindle-shaped cells. A kyphoplasty procedure was performed at T7 for pain relief; pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of the T7 vertebra reportedly revealed necrosis, fibrosis, and bone remodeling, with prominent osteoclastic activity. Immuno-histochemical analysis revealed a few CD117 mast cells in fibrotic marrow, with no definite coexpression of CD2 or CD25 cells. Ghosts of spindle-shaped cells were observed in necrotic areas. The hematocrit was 37.8 reference range, 41.0 to 53.0, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 74 mm per hour reference range, 0 to 15, and the blood level of tryptase 20 ng per milliliter reference range, 2 to 10. The white-cell count and differential count were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes and 2-microglobulin, results of liver-function tests and serum protein electrophoresis, and the 24-hour urinary histamine level. Testing for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 was reportedly negative, as was FISH analysis for the BCR-ABL rearrangement and testing of peripheral-blood leukocytes for the Janus kinase 2 JAK2 V617F mutation and the KIT D816V mutation. Dr. Huang: Nine days before the current evaluation, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose FDG positron-emission tomography and CT PETCT revealed FDG-avid lesions throughout the axial and ap-pendicular skeleton Fig. 3. Nurse Practitioner Brezina: The day before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the allergy and immunology clinic at a second hospital. Physical examination revealed no cutaneous urticaria, urticaria pigmentosa, or angioedema. Review of the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy specimens and the iliac bone and vertebral-body biopsy specimens showed features that were interpreted as suspicious for but not diagnostic of systemic mas-tocytosis; repeat biopsy of a bone lesion and the administration of interferon- were recommended. The next day, the patient was seen in the cancer center at this hospital. The patient reported severe pain in the neck, back, and pelvic bone, as well as decreased appetite and a weight loss of 4.5 kg during the previous 2 months, intermittent mild heartburn, and no flushing, tachycardia, pruritus, urticaria pigmentosa, or diarrhea. Urinary retention had developed after initiation of pain medications, and he reported psychological stress and anxiety. He had a history of shingles, and until 5 years before this illness, he had had occasional episodes of syncope when standing. There was no history of gastric ulcers, bone fractures, abnormal blood counts, allergic rhinitis, heart disease, or prior surgeries. Medications included alprazolam, mir-tazapine, zoledronic acid administered once by infusion 1 week earlier, a fentanyl patch, hydro-morphone, and tamsulosin for urinary retention after the administration of pain medication. He had no known allergies. He was married and worked at a health care organization. He had a smoking history of 40 pack-years, currently smoked a half pack of cigarettes per day, and drank alcohol occasionally. His mother was over 90 years of age and had dementia, and his father had died at 84 years of age with coronary artery disease and prostate cancer; there was no family history of hematologic cancers. On examination, the patient was alert, oriented, and in pain. The vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. There was mild midepigastric tenderness on deep palpation, without rebound, and tenderness on palpation of the spine in the mid-thoracic and lumbosacral regions. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit was 37.8, the blood level of lactate dehydrogenase 251 U per liter reference range, 110 to 210, the globulin level 4.4 g per deciliter reference range, 2.3 to 4.1, the uric acid level 3.4 mg per deciliter 202 mol per liter; reference range, 3.6 to 8.5 mg per deciliter 214 to 506 mol per liter, and the tryptase level 23.2 ng per milliliter reference value, 11.5; the platelet count, red-cell indexes, and results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, total protein, albumin, and parathyroid hormone. Urinalysis revealed 1 ketones and trace occult blood. A diagnostic procedure was performed.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Metastatic malignant tumor of unknown primary site.

Morris Neurology: An 18-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of fever, pharyngitis, facial swelling, and diplopia. The patient had been well until 2 weeks before the current admission, when a headache and sore throat developed, without a fever. On evaluation at her physicians office, a rapid test for streptococcal pharyngitis was negative, and she returned home. During the next 2 days, throat pain persisted and oral intake decreased. She was admitted to the observation unit of another hospital because of dehydration, weakness, and fevers, with a temperature as high as 39.4C. A chest radiograph was normal. The patient reportedly had a white-cell count of less than 2000 per cubic millimeter, positive tests for IgG and IgM antibodies to EpsteinBarr virus EBVspe-cific viral capsid antigen and antibodies to EBV nuclear antigen, and negative tests for heterophile antibodies, influenza A and B viruses, and IgM and IgG antibodies to cytomegalovirus CMV. A pharyngeal culture grew group C streptococcus. Cultures of the blood and urine were sterile. A diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis with possible bacterial superinfection was made. Intravenous fluids were administered, and her condition improved. On day 2, treatment with erythromycin was begun and she was discharged home. Nine days before the current admission, trismus, pain on opening the mouth, and swelling on the right side of the face and jaw developed. The patient returned to the emergency department of the same hospital; parotitis was diagnosed, and ibuprofen was administered. Pain persisted on the right side of the jaw and was associated with temperatures as high as 38.3C and swelling and erythema of the right parotid gland and face. Six days before the current admission, the patient was seen at a second hospital; prednisone and narcotic analgesic agents were administered, and massage of the parotid gland was performed. She returned home. Fevers persisted, and edema of the right lateral side of the face and neck worsened. Three days later, she was seen by her physician and was admitted to the second hospital. Computed tomography CT of the head and neck reportedly revealed no evidence of retropharyngeal or periton-sillar abscesses. Trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, and intravenous fluids were administered. Two days before the current admission, swelling of the right eyelids and horizontal diplopia developed. On evaluation, there was decreased abduction of the right eye. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Jason M. Johnson: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head and neck, performed with and without the administration of contrast material, revealed a multiloculated, rim-enhancing fluid collection in the right parotid gland and inflammation of the masticator space. There was linear enhancement of the pachymeninges in the right temporal region, a finding that raised concern about meningitis. Diffusion-weighted images obtained at the level of the parotid gland showed findings consistent with an abscess. There was an irregularity of the right cavernous sinus, without definite thrombosis. A subperios-teal abscess in the right orbit was also identified. Dr. Morris: The patient was transferred to a third hospital. On examination, she was alert and communicative. The vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. There was diffuse swelling of the right preauricular and periorbital areas, mild trismus, bilateral cervical submental and submandibular lymphadenopathy greater on the right side than on the left, and preauricular and postauricular lymphadenopathy on the right side. White plaque was seen on the gingivobuccal sul-cus and anterior tongue, which was painful when scraped. The right Stensens duct was tender on firm compression, with no fluid discharge. On neurologic examination, the right eye had medial deviation, with an inability to abduct past the mid-line. The patient had mild difficulty with tandem walking. The general and neurologic examinations were otherwise normal. The activated partial-thromboplastin time, red-cell indexes, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were levels of electrolytes, magnesium, globulin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and IgG, IgA, and IgM. Tests for heterophile antibodies, antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus HIV types 1 and 2, and HIV nucleic acid were negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed trace protein, 3 glucose, and 2 urobi-linogen, along with squamous epithelial cells and bacteria, findings suggestive of contamination. Dr. Johnson: MRI of the head, orbits, face, and neck, performed with and without the administration of contrast material Fig. 1, reportedly revealed changes consistent with multiple lobu-lated abscesses in the right parotid gland, with extensive inflammation surrounding the gland that involved the muscles of mastication, as well as a small subperiosteal abscess along the right lateral orbital wall, dural enhancement along the right temporal lobe, and enhancement along the cavernous sinus; these findings were again not thought to constitute definite evidence of thrombosis. Changes consistent with extensive periodontal disease were also seen. Vancomycin, meropenem, and clindamycin were administered. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous fine-needle aspiration of fluid collected in the parotid gland was performed, and the aspirate was cultured. The following day, CT of the sinuses, performed with the administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed preseptal swelling of the right eye extending to the temporal fossa, subperios-teal enhancement adjacent to the right lateral rectus muscle, and heterogeneous enhancement and enlargement of the right parotid gland; there was no substantial improvement in the appearance of the orbital or parotid abnormalities as compared with the previous imaging studies. Dr. Morris: The patient was transferred to Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, which is affiliated with this hospital. Medications on transfer included vancomycin, meropenem, clindamycin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, and enoxaparin, as well as an albuterol inhaler, lorazepam, oxy-codone, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen, as needed. She reported having fatigue and double vision, without headache, pain in her eye or throat, or pain with eye movements. She had a history of dysmenorrhea, for which she took norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol oral contraceptives, and asthma. She was allergic to penicillins, which had caused urticaria, and was possibly allergic to cephalosporins. She lived with her family and attended high school. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs, and she had had no travel-related exposures. On examination, the patient was somnolent but arousable. The vital signs were normal, as was the oxygen saturation while she was breathing ambient air. The right parotid gland, face, and neck were swollen, with marked periorbital edema of the right eyelid, minimal erythema and tenderness, and no palpable fluctuance; the right eye had 1 lateral clear chemosis Fig. 2. The right parotid gland was tender. There was a whitish plaque on the inner aspect of the right buccal mucosa, which was tender and had no obvious abscesses. The patient was able to swallow oral secretions. A systolic murmur, grade 1 out of 6, was heard at the left lower sternal border. There was bilateral submandibular lymphade-nopathy, greater on the right side than on the left. On neurologic examination, visual acuity was 2030 in the right eye and 2020 in the left. In the right eye, supraduction was limited by 50, abduction was slightly limited, and infraduction and adduction were normal; the left eye had normal motility, with splinting on upgaze. Other cranial-nerve functions excluding smell, which was not tested and the remainder of the general and neurologic examinations were normal. Diagnostic procedures were performed, and the patient was admitted to this hospital.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Lemierre’s syndrome caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum, with cavernous-sinus thrombophle-bitis, carotid-artery thromboarteritis, and abscesses of the parotid gland and subperiosteal orbit.

Cincotta Psychiatry: A 35-year-old woman was seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of a pruritic rash. The patient had a history of hepatitis C virus HCV infection, acne, depression, and drug dependency. She had been in her usual health until 2 weeks before this presentation, when insomnia developed, which she attributed to her loss of a prescription for zolpidem. During the 10 days before this presentation, she reported seeing white granular balls, which she thought were mites or larvae, emerging from and crawling on her skin, sheets, and clothing and in her feces, apartment, and car, as well as having an associated pruritic rash. She was seen by her physician, who referred her to a dermatologist for consideration of other possible causes of the persistent rash, such as porphyria cutanea tarda, which is associated with HCV infection. Three days before this presentation, the patient ran out of clonazepam after an undefined period during which she reportedly took more than the prescribed dose and had increasing anxiety and insomnia. The same day, she reported seeing bugs on her 15-month-old son that were emerging from his scalp and were present on his skin and in his diaper and sputum. The patient scratched her skin and her childs skin to remove the offending agents. The day before this presentation, she called emergency medical services and she and her child were transported by ambulance to the emergency department of another hospital. A diagnosis of possible cheyletiellosis was made. She was advised to use selenium sulfide shampoo and to follow up with her physician; the patient returned home with her child. On the morning of admission, while bathing her child, she noted that his scalp was turning red and he was crying. She came with her son to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient reported the presence of bugs on her skin, which she attempted to point out to examiners. She acknowledged a habit of picking at her skin since adolescence, which she said had a calming effect. Fourteen months earlier, shortly after the birth of her son, worsening acne developed that did not respond to treatment with topical antimicrobial agents and tretinoin. Four months later, a facial abscess due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA was successfully treated with oral trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole. The patients son had had a MRSA-related skin infection, and after antibiotic treatment, Clostridium difficile colitis developed, which required hospitalization. The patient reported a history of major depression now in remission but reported having no symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations or delusions, during the periods of depression. She was dependent on sedativehypnotic medications and opiates and occasionally used illicit amphetamine salts; she reported having taken 60 mg of amphetamine salts in recent days. A diagnosis of HCV infection had been made 2 years earlier. She had had diverticulitis and nephrolithiasis, and 4 years earlier, she had a perforated duodenal ulcer that required surgical repair. Medications included buprenorphine and naloxone in combination 8 mg sublingually twice daily, although 20 mg daily was prescribed, sertraline 150 mg daily, until it ran out 2 days earlier, clonazepam 0.5 mg three times daily, until it ran out 3 days earlier, and omeprazole. She had no known allergies. She did not drink alcohol. She had injected oxycodone in the past but reported no opioid use since the birth of her child. She lived with her son, had been unemployed for 2 years, and received transitional food assistance i.e., food stamps. Her maternal aunt had schizophrenia, and her mother had attempted suicide during the patients childhood. On examination, the patient was cooperative, anxious, and disheveled and indicated affected areas of skin to caregivers. The blood pressure was 141/95 mm Hg, and the pulse 100 beats per minute; the temperature and respiratory rate were normal. She was fully oriented. There were excoriations on her face, arms, and legs, but the mid-back was spared. The remainder of the general examination was normal. On mental-status examination, the patient was irritable and somewhat hostile toward a female interviewer but pleasant and cooperative with a male interviewer. She was convinced that she had a parasitic infestation and thought she might have Morgellons a condition in which patients describe inorganic material such as fibers emerging from the skin in combination with cutaneous sensations, which she had read about on the Internet. She pleaded with examiners for their help and belief in her concerns. Her thought process was perseverative and occasion-ally tangential. She intermittently scratched herself. She reported no neurovegetative symptoms of depression other than insomnia. The blood level of phosphorus was 1.9 mg per deciliter 0.61 mmol per liter; reference range, 2.6 to 4.5 mg per deciliter 0.84 to 1.45 mmol per liter, and the blood level of aspartate aminotrans-ferase was 43 U per liter reference range, 9 to 32. The complete blood count, white-cell differential count, and lipid profile were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, total protein, globulin, vitamin B12, folate, thyrotropin, and albumin, as well as the results of other tests of liver function. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones and 3 occult blood by dipstick, mucin, and 5 to 10 red cells, 0 to 2 white cells, few bacteria, few squamous cells, and very few transitional cells per high-power field. A urinary test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative, and screening for toxins was positive for amphetamines. The patient was admitted to the hospital.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Amphetamine-induced psychosis, with delusional parasitosis and neurotic excoriations.

Simmons: An 87-year-old man with multiple chronic medical problems was seen in an outpatient clinic of this hospital because of sore throat and fatigue. The patient had been in his usual health until several weeks before presentation, when hoarseness, sore throat, and increasing fatigue developed. At the urging of his family, he was seen by his physician in an outpatient clinic of this hospital. He reported hoarseness, increasing facial puffiness, and periorbital swelling, with no chest pain, dyspnea, or new joint pains or muscle aches. The patient had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. Two months earlier, the creatinine level was 2.22 mg per deciliter 196 mol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter 53 to 133 mol per liter, which was stable, as compared with values obtained the previous year. He also had hypothyroidism, with a normal thyrotropin level 8 months earlier 3.38 U per milliliter reference range, 0.40 to 5.00, as well as gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophageal motility disorder, an abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic back pain, depression related to the death of his wife several years before, and recurrent urinary tract infections. In the past, he had had pneumonia and had undergone angioplasty of the right renal artery 10 years earlier, a cholecystectomy, a lobectomy of the right middle lobe due to a spiculated nodule that was found to be benign, photoselective vaporization of the prostate due to obstructive benign prostatic hypertrophy 2 months before this presentation, and wrist surgery. Medications included atenolol, vitamin D3, a fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhaler, aspirin, citalopram, a flutica-sone nasal spray, atorvastatin, omeprazole, and levothyroxine. Lisinopril had caused a cough, and zolpidem tartrate had caused nightmares. The patient was retired and lived alone. He could independently perform activities of daily living, and he managed his own medications. His three children lived nearby and were in frequent contact with him, but he came to most medical appointments unaccompanied. He was under the regular care of an internist, a nephrologist, a cardiologist, and a urologist. Immunizations were up to date. He had stopped smoking many years earlier and did not drink alcohol. His father had died of liver cancer, and a son had sarcoidosis; his two other children were healthy. On examination, the patient was pleasant, smiling, and in no distress; he spoke with a hoarse voice. The blood pressure was 130/72 mm Hg, the pulse 59 beats per minute, the oxygen saturation 96 while he was breathing ambient air, the weight 86.8 kg approximately 4.5 kg greater than it had been 1 month earlier, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 29.9. There was facial swelling and periorbital edema; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, calcium, phosphorus, and total bilirubin and the plasma anion gap were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. An appointment with an otolaryngologist was scheduled, and the patient returned home. Two days later, when the results of the laboratory tests were known, he was instructed by his physician to stop taking atorvastatin, and a follow-up appointment was scheduled for 9 days later in the outpatient clinic for repeat blood tests.Seven days after presentation, the patient called his doctor’s office at his daughter’s urging to report persistent hoarseness and swelling of his face and abdomen, which he indicated had been present for months but had, according to his daughter, worsened recently. Four days later, 11 days after presentation, he was seen in the outpatient clinic, where he reported markedly worsening fatigue, especially after walking, with associated dyspnea, facial edema, weight gain, cough that produced white mucus, and laryngitis. He reported no chest pain or worsening arthralgias and stated that he was taking all his medications. Chest radiographs were obtained. Dr. Florian J. Fintelmann: Frontal and lateral chest radiographs (Figure 1) showed no changes, as compared with chest radiographs and computed tomographic scans obtained 9 months previously. In addition to sutures from the lobectomy of the right middle lobe, there were small reticulonodular opacities at the right base, findings suggestive of scarring due to recurrent aspiration or prior infection. No evidence of pulmonary edema, lymphadenopathy, or a mediastinal mass was seen.Dr. Simmons: A complete blood count and a white-cell differential count were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, total bilirubin, and C-reactive protein; other test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic test result was received.\n### OUTPUT:", "true": "Severe hypothyroidism. ", "predict": "1. Hypothyroidism\n2. Superior vena cava syndrome\n3. Heart failure\n4. Nephrotic syndrome\n5.
