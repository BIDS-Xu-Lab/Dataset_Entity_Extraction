Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr.RobertH.Goldstein Medicine: A 76-year-old man with chronic renal disease, renal obstruction, and a 10-year history of recurrent urinary tract infections was admitted to this hospital because of fever, worsening renal function, and confusion. The patient had been in his usual state of health until approximately 1 week before admission, in midsummer, when subjective fevers and increasing urinary frequency developed. He contacted his physicians office; nitrofurantoin was prescribed, and he was advised to hydrate well. During the following week, there was partial improvement of his symptoms. He continued to be physically active until 2 days before admission, when fatigue and increasing somnolence developed. He slept most of the next day. In the evening, he appeared slightly confused and had difficulty placing a thermometer in his mouth. The temperature was 39.1C. He was taken to the emergency department of another hospital. Shortly after arrival, the patient became nauseated, with vomiting and progressive somnolence. On examination, the temperature was 38.5C, the blood pressure 142/48 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while he was breathing ambient air. He appeared confused and did not follow commands. The remainder of the examination was normal; the patient did not have slurred speech, and there were no focal neurologic findings. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and blood levels of glucose, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, calcium, magnesium, and lactic acid were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis reportedly revealed cloudy yellow urine, with a dipstick test showing moderate occult blood, a small amount of leukocyte esterase, protein 30 mg per deciliter, and no nitrites and sediment examination revealing 15 to 20 white cells and 10 to 15 red cells per high-power field, with occasional bacteria and epithelial cells. A chest radiograph reportedly was normal. Cultures of the blood and urine were obtained. Computed tomography CT of the brain showed no evidence of an acute intracranial process. Vancomycin and ciprofloxa-cin were administered for possible urosepsis, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. After admission, the patient was noted to be persistently febrile, speaking incoherently, and unable to follow a conversation. Renal ultrasonography, in a limited study, reportedly revealed possible mild hydronephrosis of the left kidney and a cyst, 2.1 cm by 2.9 cm, in the left kidney. An indwelling Foley catheter was placed. Later that day, he was transferred to this hospital. Relatives reported that the patients perceived work of breathing and nonproductive cough had increased since admission to the other hospital. There was evidence of recent bilateral hydrone-phrosis, with worsening chronic renal failure blood level of creatinine, 2.9 mg per deciliter 260 mol per liter, prostatitis, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of the prostate gland had revealed hypertrophy and inflammation. Two months before admission, photoselective vaporization of the prostate had been performed with a laser, after which the creatinine level decreased to 1.8 mg per deciliter 160 mol per liter. The patient had hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, premature ventricular contractions, and allergic rhinitis. He had had basal-cell carcinoma; he also had had orthopedic injuries, including chest-wall trauma and reconstruction, after a motor vehicle accident. Medications before admission included meto-prolol, nitrofurantoin, aspirin, and doxazosin. He was allergic to penicillin and sulfa drugs. He was married and worked in an office. He lived in an urban area of New England and had recently visited a forested region of New England, which reportedly had heavy tick and mosquito burdens; his wife reported no known tick exposures. He drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. His father and paternal grandfather had had heart disease, and his mother had died in her 30s of an intracerebral hemorrhage. On examination, the patient was warm, dia-phoretic, and obtunded, with nonverbal moaning. The temperature was 38.4C, the blood pressure 158/67 mm Hg, the pulse 52 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 25 to 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while he was breathing oxygen by nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The conjunctivae were injected. He was unable to follow commands or track his eyes in response to his name. A lesion on the right side of the tongue was consistent with a possible bite. His neck was stiff, without pain elicited on passive movement. Bronchial breath sounds throughout all lung fields obscured the heart sounds. Palpation of the right lower quadrant induced wincing; examination of the abdomen was otherwise normal. The extremities were warm and well perfused, without edema. Distal pulses were symmetric and normal. On neurologic examination, the pupils were 4 mm in diameter and constricted to 3 mm with light. Extraocular movements were difficult to assess, but they appeared intact, without nystagmus. Pinching the right arm induced grimacing, pinching the right great toe induced minimal withdrawal of the right leg, and there was no response to pinching the left arm or leg. Move-ment of all limbs was otherwise nonpurposeful and spontaneous. The tone was increased in the arms, with cogwheel rigidity and myoclonus. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, and lactic acid and results of coagulation and liver-function tests; other results are shown in Table 1. Review of a peripheral-blood smear revealed thrombocytope-nia. Urinalysis revealed cloudy, yellow urine with a pH of 5.5 and a specific gravity of 1.015. The urine had trace ketones, 2 occult blood, and 2 protein and was positive for leukocyte esterase; there were 3 to 5 red cells, few white cells, few bacteria, few squamous cells, and very few transitional cells per high-power field and 10 to 20 granular casts and mucin per low-power field. An electrocardiogram showed ventricular bi-geminy, at a rate of approximately 100 beats per minute, but a true ventricular rate of 55 beats per minute; the native QRS complex was narrow, without a prolonged PR interval. A chest radiograph showed low lung volumes and increased opacity at the left lung base, which were thought to represent atelectasis, pneumonia, or pleural fluid. A lumbar puncture was performed, requiring multiple attempts because of the patients rigidity and movement; results of cerebrospinal fluid CSF analysis are shown in Table 1. Specimens of blood, sputum, urine, and CSF were cultured. Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: CT of the brain performed without the administration of contrast material revealed mild, nonspecific periventricu-lar hypoattenuation. There was no evidence of an acute intracranial process. An extraaxial mass 9 mm in greatest dimension that was consistent with a meningioma was noted overlying the left sylvian fissure. Dr. Goldstein: Ceftriaxone, meropenem, and acyclovir were administered. During the second night, the patient became increasingly tachypneic and required increasing suction to clear his airway. He was transferred to the intensive care unit ICU, and the trachea was intubated for airway protection. CT of the abdomen revealed moderate bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter, findings that were not changed from studies 2 months earlier. Dr. Gonzalez: The next day, magnetic resonance imaging MRI and magnetic resonance arteri-ography revealed a small amount of material with restricted diffusion layering in the occipital horns of the right and left lateral ventricles Fig. 1, which was thought to be most consistent with purulence and ventriculitis. The mass noted previously was visualized, with no evidence of infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, or a hemody-namically significant intracranial arterial lesion. Dr. Goldstein: During the next 3 days, episodes of hypertension to more than 200 mm Hg systolic occurred and were treated with labetalol; propofol was administered for respiratory efforts in dyssynchrony with the mechanical ventilator. On the seventh day, diagnostic test results were received.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "West Nile virus meningoencephalitis. ", "prediction": "1. Urosepsis: Given the patient's history of recurrent urinary tract infections, renal obstruction, and recent symptoms of fever, confusion, and pyuria, urosepsis remains the most likely diagnosis.\n\n2. Meningitis: The patient's confusion, fever, neck stiffness, and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid analysis suggest a possible meningitis, potentially of bacterial origin.\n\n3. Encephalitis: With the patient's confusion, fever, and recent forest exposure, a viral encephalitis, such as from mosquito or tick-borne viruses, should be considered.\n\n4. Acute renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function and recent history of fever and infection could point towards acute renal failure superimposed on chronic kidney disease.\n\n5. Prostatitis: The patient's prostatomegaly, documented history of prostate inflammation, and recurrent UTIs could indicate acute prostatitis exacerbating systemic symptoms.\n\n6. Lyme disease: Considering the patient's forest exposure in an endemic area and the development of systemic symptoms, Lyme disease should be in the differential.\n\n7. Pyelonephritis: Left-sided mild hydronephrosis and urinary symptoms such as white cells in urine may point towards pyelonephritis.\n\n8. Ventriculitis: MRI findings of purulent material in the ventricles, along with systemic signs of infection, suggest possible ventriculitis.\n\n9. Bacterial endocarditis: The patient's episodic fever, history of atrial fibrillation, and presence of systemic symptoms without a clear source of infection raises suspicion for endocarditis.\n\n10. Septic emboli: The patient's lung opacity, fever, and new systemic symptoms suggest the possibility of septic emboli, especially in the context of a potential bacteremia."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Elizabeth G. Pinsky Psychiatry: A 12-year-old girl was seen in the outpatient psychiatry clinic of this hospital because of severe irritability, hypersomnia, and multiple somatic symptoms. The patient had celiac disease but had been otherwise well until approximately 8 months earlier, when she became increasingly irritable and reported daily stomachaches, tingling and pain in her arms and legs, dizziness, anorexia, and severe fatigue; she also became increasingly somnolent, sleeping up to 13 hours per night. She had frequent angry outbursts directed at her mother and sister, and acted out physically on occasion. She became increasingly isolated from her friends and lost interest in activities. Her performance in school deteriorated, and she failed mathematics. Approximately 4.5 months before this presentation, red-cell indexes and results of thyroid-function tests were normal, and testing for heterophile antibody was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. She was referred to the outpatient gastroenterology, neurology, and psychiatry clinics of this hospital. The patient was born to a 39-year-old mother by cesarean section because of maternal preeclampsia, and her childhood development was normal. A diagnosis of celiac disease had been made at the age of 8 years, when she presented with abdominal pain and constipation; elevated levels of tissue transglutaminase antibody 70 U per milliliter and endomysial antibody 80 U per milliliter were detected, and examination of a biopsy specimen of the duodenum showed changes consistent with celiac disease. She adhered to a gluten-free diet and had been otherwise well. She had a history of anxiety and depression; she had no response to a trial of sertraline but did have a response to both escitalopram, begun 2 years before this evaluation, and 7 months of cognitive behavioral therapy. Sixteen months before this evaluation, the first of three episodes of severe vomiting requiring intravenous hydration occurred; subsequent episodes occurred 6 months and 4 months before this evaluation, each preceded by fever and viral symptoms. There was no associated headache, and neurologic evaluation including an electroencephalogram was reportedly normal. The patients mother noted that the patient had a long history of daydreaming. She had not begun to menstruate. She had no history of head injury, loss of consciousness, urinary symptoms, hospitalizations, or surgery. Her only medication was 10 mg daily of escitalopram. She had no known allergies. She lived with her parents and younger sister. Her mother had thyroid disease; maternal and paternal aunts, a paternal uncle, and her paternal grandmother had celiac disease; a paternal uncle had bipolar disorder; and other relatives had anxiety, depression, or attention deficithyperactivity disorder ADHD. There was no family history of cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, liver disease, pancreatitis, or diabetes mellitus. On examination, the patient was slim and appeared exhausted, without apparent physical dis-tress. The blood pressure was 83/52 mm Hg, the pulse 102 beats per minute, the head circumference 53.2 cm, the weight 35.4 kg, and the height 149.9 cm, with a body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters of 15.8 12th percentile for age. The skin was freckled, with multiple dark nevi and slight hyperpigmentation in the axillae. Results of cranial-nerve testing and funduscopic examination were normal. Strength was full throughout. Reflexes were brisk, and plantar responses were flexor. Clonus 2 to 3 beats, unsustained on the right foot occurred, but the finding was not easily repeated. The patient initially rocked on her feet during tandem gait but later skipped and jumped without difficulty. Results of sensory examination and Romberg testing were normal. When talking with the psychiatrist, the patient focused primarily on her pain and fatigue. She appeared withdrawn and disengaged, with a sad and apathetic affect. Her speech was sparse, slow, and soft at times, and eye contact and spontaneous movements were limited. Her three wishes were to have a cell phone so she could call her mother when she became nervous while waiting for her mother to pick her up at school, to have different friends, and to have school be different. There was no delusional content, suicidal ideation, or hallucinations. In the waiting area, she fell asleep, awakening to gentle shaking but not to voice. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head was normal. Diagnoses of major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder were made. Weekly therapy sessions were begun. During the next 3 weeks, the administration of escitalo-pram was changed to bedtime; the administration of bupropion was begun and gradually increased to 75 mg daily. The patient continued to have worsening dizziness, lightheadedness, headaches, stomachaches, and musculoskeletal pain. She had two episodes of vomiting at school, with nonbloody, nonbilious emesis and dry heaves, and her oral intake decreased. On repeat examination in the psychiatry clinic 6 weeks after the initial evaluation, the patient appeared listless and pallid. Her weight was 34.0 kg. She was referred to her pediatrician for further evaluation. On examination at the pediatricians office 5 days later, the weight was 32.9 kg. Blood levels of platelets, glucose, total protein, albumin, total and direct bilirubin, alanine aminotrans-ferase, and C-reactive protein were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Bupropion was stopped, and she was referred to the emergency department of another hospital. On examination, the blood pressure was 87/45 mm Hg, the pulse 92 beats per minute with the patient in a supine position and 124 beats per minute while she was standing, the tympanic temperature 36.4C, and the weight 33.5 kg. The remainder of the examination was normal. An electrocardiogram reportedly showed sinus rhythm at 100 beats per minute, with a normal axis, a prolonged QT interval corrected for heart rate of 505 msec, a T-wave inversion in lead III, and bi-phasic T waves in lead V3. Test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Major depressive disorder and high suspicion for a concurrent medical illness. ", "prediction": "1. Major Depressive Disorder: Her symptoms of irritability, hypersomnia, fatigue, social withdrawal, and deteriorating school performance strongly align with major depressive disorder.\n2. Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Given her history of anxiety and ongoing reports of nervousness and daydreaming, generalized anxiety disorder is a likely comorbid condition.\n3. Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS): The orthostatic tachycardia, dizziness, and fatigue suggest a possible diagnosis of POTS, especially considering the orthostatic increase in pulse rate.\n4. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis: The severe fatigue, hypersomnia, and multiple somatic complaints could indicate chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis.\n5. Adrenal Insufficiency: Features such as orthostatic hypotension, fatigue, and weight loss raise the possibility of adrenal insufficiency.\n6. Celiac Disease-Related Neuropathy: Despite adherence to a gluten-free diet, celiac disease can still be associated with neuropathic symptoms, including tingling and pain in the limbs.\n7.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Jennifer Lyons Neurology: A 32-year-old right-handed woman was seen in the neurology clinic of this hospital because of episodes of altered consciousness. She had been well until the age of 24 years, when she began having episodes of a feeling of walking through a cloud, hearing spoken words without understanding, an inability to speak, and vertigo. A witness described events lasting less than 1 minute, during which the patient would stare at her hands, make gripping movements, and sometimes swear, and then be confused for 2 to 3 minutes. She had little memory of events after the episodes. During several episodes, she lost muscle tone and collapsed. During the next 8 years, episodes recurred at an accelerating rate, sometimes with loss of consciousness, abrupt collapse, and occasional incontinence. The frequency increased 4 to 5 days before menses. Three months before this evaluation, the patient struck her head during a typical episode. She was admitted to another hospital, where results of magnetic resonance imaging MRI, electrocardiography ECG, echocardiography, Holter monitoring, routine and 3-day ambulatory electroencephalography EEG, and multiple blood tests were reportedly normal; no episodes occurred during monitoring. There was no symptomatic improvement after the administration of triptans or beta-blockers. Subsequently, the frequency of episodes increased to at least daily. On evaluation at this hospital, she reported no fever, chills, rashes, neck pain, tinnitus, baseline vertigo, palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, cough, weakness, numbness, gastrointestinal symptoms, or changes in vision, hearing, balance, gait, or bladder habits. Between the ages of 9 and 22 years, she had had occasional episodes of syncope after painful stimuli such as immunizations or blood draws. She took no medications and had no known drug allergies. She lived with her husband and children and worked in a pharmacy. She drank alcohol infrequently, had stopped drinking caffeinated beverages after the onset of these symptoms, and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her mother had a history of headaches and drug abuse, and her father was healthy; there was no family history of neurologic diseases. On examination, the blood pressure and pulse were normal, with appropriate orthostatic changes. A detailed neurologic examination and the general physical examination were normal. A diagnosis of probable complex partial seizures with secondary generalization was made, and the patient was advised to stop driving. Two months later, a 72-hour ambulatory EEG captured 10 seizures arising from the left temporal lobe, all of which were noted by the patient. Lamotrigine was administered and the dosage was increased to 150 mg twice daily, with reduction in the frequency of events from three times daily to approximately once every 3 days. One month later, MRI of the brain was performed. Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: MRI was performed with and without the administration of contrast material Fig. 1, in accordance with an epilepsy protocol. On T2-weighted images, there is a well-demarcated focus of increased signal intensity in the left inferomedial temporal lobe. The mass does not enhance with gadolinium. It has heterogeneous signal intensity that is predominantly hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. The mass involves the occipitotemporal fusiform gyrus and causes mild local mass effect. The appearance is most suggestive of a primary brain neoplasm, such as a low-grade glioma. In retrospect, the same finding is present on the study from 6 months earlier, although it is harder to identify because of the positioning of the slices. Dr. Lyons: During the next 7 months, the patient continued to have staring spells, some of which were associated with sudden loss of postural tone and collapse. Antiseizure medications, including lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbaze-pine, and clonazepam, were aggressively adjusted without a clinically significant effect. Ten months after her initial outpatient evaluation, the patient was admitted to this hospital, and additional diagnostic testing was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Left-temporal-lobe epilepsy due to a tumor in the left fusiform gyrus, most likely a glioma, complicated by ictal asystole in a patient with a predisposition to neurocardiogenic syncope. ", "prediction": "1. Temporal Lobe Epilepsy: The episodes of altered consciousness, staring spells, and gripping movements suggest a focal seizure originating from the temporal lobe, supported by EEG findings.\n2. Low-Grade Glioma: The MRI findings of a well-demarcated focus of increased signal intensity in the left inferomedial temporal lobe are indicative of a primary brain tumor.\n3. Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures (PNES): Given the recurrence and the complexity of symptoms without corresponding EEG changes during some episodes, PNES could be considered.\n4. Syncope: The history of syncope after painful stimuli and episodes of sudden loss of muscle tone and collapse could suggest a vasovagal or cardiogenic origin.\n5. Migraine with Aura: Though less likely, episodes of visual and auditory disturbances preceding vertigo and altered consciousness could indicate a complex migraine.\n6. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA): Recurrent, brief episodes of neurological deficit could be due to transient ischemia, although the normal cardiac workup makes this less likely.\n7. Multiple Sclerosis: The MRI findings and episodic nature of symptoms, including vertigo and loss of muscle tone, could suggest demyelinating disease.\n8. Metabolic Encephalopathy: The patient's episodes might be linked to metabolic disturbances, although routine blood tests being normal lowers this probability.\n9. Drug-Induced Seizures: While no current medication use is noted, past medication or substance abuse, including alcohol, could contribute to seizure-like activity.\n10. Brainstem Glioma: Although less likely due to MRI locating the mass in the temporal lobe, brainstem involvement could explain episodes of loss of muscle tone and consciousness."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Giuseppe Barbesino Medicine: A 35-year-old woman was seen in the endocrinology clinic of this hospital because of recurrent goiter. The patient had been well until she was 16 years of age, when bilateral thyroid nodularity developed, with normal thyroid function. Pathological examination of tissue obtained by fine-needle aspiration at another hospital reportedly showed cyto-logic features that were suspicious for a follicular neoplasm. Near-total thyroidectomy 100 of the right lobe and 80 of the left lobe was performed. Postoperatively, levothyroxine was administered. Fourteen years later, a mass developed in the left side of the neck. Ultrasonogra-phy performed at a second hospital reportedly showed a nodule, 9 cm in diameter, in the left lobe of the thyroid. On cytologic examination, a sample of the nodule obtained by core needle biopsy reportedly was suspicious for a follicular neoplasm. A completion thyroidectomy with dissection of the strap muscles was performed. Pathological examination of the tissue reportedly showed no evidence of cancer. Postoperatively, hypoparathyroidism developed. Six months later, a mass recurred in the left side of the neck. During the next year, hot flashes developed, and a diagnosis of primary ovarian failure was made when the patient was 32 years of age. When the patient was 33.5 years of age, ultrasonography of the thyroid reportedly revealed a small amount of thyroid tissue on the right side and a new echo-genic thyroid nodule on the left side, which displaced the carotid artery. Cytologic examination of fine-needle aspirate from the nodule was reportedly suspicious for a follicular neoplasm. She was referred to the endocrinology clinic at this hospital. The patient reported no hoarseness, dysphagia, shortness of breath, or neck pain. She had a history of fibrocystic breast disease and had undergone multiple, benign breast biopsies, and she had been exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero. She had undergone a right ovarian cystectomy, stripping of varicose veins, and tonsillectomy, as well as excision of skin lesions on the face, with unknown histopatho-logical findings. There was no history of neck irradiation. Medications included levothyroxine, calcitriol, estradiol administered by a transdermal patch, and oral progesterone 12 days per month. She had an allergy to shellfish manifested by angioedema and had no known allergies to medications. She was married, had no children, and worked in an office. She drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her mother had thyroiditis, her father had had colonic polyps, and a sister had had a small goiter at 31 years of age. On examination, the blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg, the pulse 78 beats per minute, and the weight 95.3 kg. The patient was obese, with facial acne. There was a healed surgical scar on the neck and a mobile, rubbery nodule, 4 cm in diameter, in the upper left thyroid bed. A positive Chvosteks sign brisk twitching of the lips was elicited on percussion of the homolateral masse-ter region, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, thyrotropin, thyroglobulin, and thyroglobulin antibody were normal. Eight months later, the left thyroid nodule measured 6 cm in diameter on examination; computed tomography CT of the neck, performed without the administration of contrast material, and ultrasonography revealed a heterogeneous mass, 48 mm in diameter, with central calcification at the level of the left thyroid bed. Completion thyroidectomy of the left lobe with partial strap-muscle resection was performed. Pathological examination showed an adenomatous goiter and no evidence of cancer. Postoperatively, liothyronine l-isomer of triio-dothyronine T3 was administered. The blood level of thyrotropin was 26.4 U per milliliter normal range, 0.4 to 5.0 and the level of thyroglobulin 1.8 ng per milliliter normal range, 4 to 40. The thyroglobulin antibody and urinary iodine levels were normal. The 24-hour uptake of radioactive iodine iodine-123 was 9, and the scan of the thyroid with iodine-123 showed a single focus of intense uptake in the left thyroid bed and a subtle focus of uptake in the right thyroid bed. Whole-body scanning performed 3 days after an oral dose of 49.9 mCi of iodine-131 and immediately after the intravenous injection of 39.6 MBq of technetium-99m pertechnetate, with multiple dual-photon images of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, showed iodine uptake in the midline and the right side of the neck, findings suggestive of a remnant of thyroid tissue. When the patient was 35.5 years old, analogue mammography performed at another hospital revealed abnormalities in the left breast. Pathological examination of fine-needle aspiration biopsy and core-biopsy specimens of separate lesions in the left breast reportedly showed intraductal scle-rosing papilloma and benign ductal hyperplasia. One month later, the patient returned to this hospital. The blood level of thyroglobulin was less than 0.2 ng per milliliter. Blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, thyrotropin, and thyroglobulin antibody were normal. Focused ultrasound examination of the left breast showed a dilated duct 5 mm by 8 mm in cross section that consisted of mixed echotex-tures. During the next 5 months, four excisional biopsies of lesions in the left breast were performed. Pathological examination of the specimens showed ductal carcinoma in situ grade 2 spanning at least 1.2 cm; a low-grade phyllodes tumor, 1.1 cm; a hamartoma, 1 cm, with benign ductal hyperplasia; intraductal pap-illoma; atypical ductal hyperplasia; atypical lobular hyperplasia; atypical apocrine hyperplasia; and proliferative fibrocystic changes. The ductal carcinoma in situ cells expressed both estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor proteins. Treatment with estrogen and progesterone was stopped, and a course of radiation therapy was administered to the left breast. At the age of 36.5 years, the patient returned to the endocrinology clinic at this hospital for follow-up. On examination, there were micronodular lesions on the gingiva and tongue Fig. 1A and 1B; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Thyroid ultrasonography revealed a small hypoechoic region of the left thyroid bed that measured 6 mm in maximal dimension, an increase from 3 mm 1.5 years earlier. The blood level of thyroglobulin was less than 0.2 ng per milliliter. Blood levels of calcium, thyrotropin, and thyroglobulin antibody were normal. Additional diagnostic testing was performed.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Lindsay E. Brown Medicine: A 29-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of anemia and jaundice. The patient had been in his usual health until 4 days before admission, when increasing fatigue, malaise, headache, intermittent testicular discomfort, yellowed eyes, dark urine, nausea, and diffuse body aches developed and chronic leg pain worsened. No fever, rash, hematuria, dysuria, melena, or neurologic symptoms were present. On the day of admission, he came to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient had been generally well, with intermittent asthma, acne, and chronic leg pain until 4 months earlier, when he traveled from an urban area of New England to his familys home in North Africa and stayed for 3 months. While he was there, a prolonged cough productive of green sputum developed, associated with fatigue, subjective fevers, chills, drenching night sweats, and intermittent dyspnea at rest, and he reportedly had a weight loss of 9.1 kg. Ten days after his return to New England, and 20 days before this admission, he was seen in the medical clinic at this hospital. On evaluation at that time, the patient appeared well. The weight was 92.7 kg, the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 23.6, and the pulse 101 beats per minute; the blood pressure and respirations were normal. Evaluation revealed mild acne, nasal turbinates that were boggy and pale and had clear secretions, slight tonsillar enlargement, inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and expiratory wheezes in both lung apexes, and surgical scars on the right leg. The level of platelets and results of hemoglobin electrophoresis were normal, and testing for human immunodeficiency virus HIV was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was normal. A Mantoux tuberculin skin test was negative. The patient was advised to continue the administration of fluticasone and albuterol by inhalers, which had been prescribed as treatment for asthma. He returned home. On the day of admission, he called his physicians office and was advised to go to the emergency department for evaluation. He was subsequently admitted to the hospital. The patient had a history of fractures of the right leg after a motor-vehicle acci-dent 3 years earlier, which required internal fixation of the tibia for nonunion, as well as bone and skin grafting; he had persistent chronic leg pain and venous swelling. One year before this admission, after tibial surgery, the hemato-crit decreased to 34.4, with a mean corpuscular volume of 77 fl normal range, 80 to 100; the anemia resolved within 4 months. Other medications included ginkgo biloba, a multivitamin, and nicotine patches for smoking cessation. He had no known allergies to medication. The patient had emigrated from North Africa to the United States 9 years earlier. He was a student, smoked marijuana and cigarettes, and reported no current alcohol or intravenous drug use. He was sexually active with his girlfriend. While the patient was visiting his family in North Africa, his 14-year-old brother died of an unspecified disease. During that trip, the patient was exposed to sheep and drank unpasteurized cows milk. His mother had osteopenia; his father and four other siblings were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 123/85 mm Hg and the pulse 115 beats per minute; the temperature, respirations, and oxygen saturation were normal. The patient appeared tired, with conjunctival icterus and jaundiced skin. The second heart sounds were loud, without murmurs. The abdomen was soft, with diffuse tenderness that was greatest in the right lower and left upper quadrants; the testicles were diffusely tender, without masses. Mild tenderness was present over the right knee and anterior shin, with healed surgical scars; the remainder of the examination was normal. The platelet count, white-cell differential count, and red-cell indexes mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were normal, as were the results of coagulation tests and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, lipase, thyrotropin, folate, and vitamin B12. Thick and thin peripheral-blood smears and rapid testing for malaria antigen, antibodies to HIV, and hetero-phile antibodies were negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. A direct antiglobulin test Coombs test was negative. Cultures of the blood were obtained. The results of urinalysis were normal, and the stool was guaiac-negative. An electrocardiogram was normal. A chest radio-graph showed clear lungs. Narcotic analgesia, ondansetron, dalteparin, phosphorus supplementation, and intravenous fluids were administered. Toxicologic examination of the urine revealed the presence of opiates and cannabi-noids. During the next 2 days, jaundice gradually improved. Blood cultures remained sterile. Additional test results are shown in Table 1. An ultrasound examination of the abdomen revealed mild hepatic steatosis; ultrasonography of the scrotum was normal. On the fourth day, a diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Acute hemolytic anemia due to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. LuisA. Arias-Urdaneta Medicine: A 51-year-old woman was seen in the rheumatol-ogy clinic of this hospital because of recurrent bloody nasal discharge and oral ulcers. The patient had been well until 3.3 years before this presentation, when episodic bilateral epistaxis developed, associated with intermittent sore throat, blood-tinged sputum, and nasal crusting, without rhinorrhea. Two months after the onset of symptoms, examination by an otolaryngologist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary revealed a straight septum, with active bleeding bilaterally. Cauterization with silver nitrate was performed, followed by packing; nasal dryness and intermittent bleeding persisted. Six months after the onset of symptoms, fiberoptic nasal endoscopic examination revealed crusting in the nose, mucosal inflammation, and synechiae in the left nasal cavity, without masses or polyps. Amoxicillin with clavu-lanate was prescribed. Three months later, surgical repair of bilateral nasal vestibular stenosis, with polymeric-silicone splints, and biopsies were performed. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimens showed superficial fragments of squamous mucosa with mild atypia, hyperkeratosis, a prominent granular layer, and no evidence of cancer. A tapering course of prednisone starting at 40 mg daily and topical triamcinolone acetonide cream were administered, with partial improvement. During the next year, symptoms persisted despite multiple fiberoptic nasal endoscopic examinations, debridement of the crusted tissue, the application of topical antibiotic unguent, and nasal rinses. Approximately 20 months after the onset of symptoms, examination revealed complete obstruction of the nasal passages, with scab formation and no polyps or discharge; nasal cultures grew normal flora. Additional debridement was followed by the application of mupirocin ointment. Follow-up cultures grew moderate anaerobes and few Staphylococcus aureus. A 2-week course of clindamycin was prescribed. Approximately 1 year before this evaluation, painful ulcers developed on the buccal mucosa and tongue. Multiple courses of prednisone up to 40 mg daily, rapidly tapering over a period of 1 week were administered, with transient improvement during each course. Testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ANCA and antinuclear antibodies was negative. A chest radiograph and results of computed tomography CT of the sinuses were normal. During the next 4 months, episodes of epistaxis increased in frequency, in association with nasal crusting and sinus congestion. Eight months before this evaluation, on evaluation by a rheumatologist at this hospital, the patient reported dyspnea, cough, fatigue, ear fullness, and weight loss of 7 kg. Examination revealed normal vital signs and an ulceration on the tip of the tongue; the remainder of the examination was normal. The blood level of thyroid peroxidase antibody was 291.0 IU per milliliter reference range, 35.0, and antibodies to double-stranded DNA were positive at 1:40 dilution reference, negative at 1:10. The complete blood count was normal, as were the levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, creatine kinase, C-reactive protein, and immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, and IgM; results of tests of renal and liver function and serum protein electrophoresis were normal. Testing for syphilis with the use of rapid plasma reagin, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, and ANCA was negative, as was testing for antibodies to Ro, La, Sm, and ribonuclear protein. Colchicine, 0.6 mg twice daily, was administered for 1 week but was stopped because of diarrhea. The patient began to use dexa-methasone elixir mouthwash, with improvement in the oral lesions. CT of the chest revealed a hia-tal hernia. Approximately 5 months before this evaluation, intermittent rectal bleeding developed. Colono-scopic examination performed at another hospital reportedly showed two ulcers, 25 cm from the anal verge, without surrounding inflammation. Pathological examination of biopsy specimens of the lesions showed no evidence of ulceration or vasculitis; there were mild nonspecific findings of focal acute cryptitis and rare lymphoid aggregates. Serologic evaluation for inflammatory bowel disease was reportedly negative except for the presence of IgG antibodies to Saccharomyces cerevisiae 34.9 ELISA enzyme-linked immunosor-bent assay units per milliliter; reference range, 17.8. Omeprazole, colchicine, and vitamin B were prescribed, without improvement. The patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. The patient rated the pain of the oral ulcers at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain, and reported recurrent epistaxis, lower gastrointestinal bleeding, fatigue, nonrestor-ative sleep, arthralgias, and intermittent pain in the elbows and legs, without swelling, erythema, or increased warmth. She did not have alopecia, uveitis, rash malar or other, genital ulcers, or anal or perianal fistulas. She had a history of Hashimotos thyroiditis, hyperlipidemia, and migraines. A transient ischemic attack had occurred 3.5 years before this evaluation, associated with tinnitus in the right ear, numbness and weakness on the left side, and possible aphasia; the symptoms had resolved after several hours. Daily medications included atenolol, cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride, levothyroxine, prednisone 20 mg, tapering from 40 mg over a period of 7 days, sim-vastatin, and aspirin 81 mg. She was allergic to trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin with clavulanate, erythromycin, and tetracycline which had caused rashes, and ciprofloxacin. The patient was married, had two grown children, and worked in an office. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her mother and sister had celiac disease, and her sister also had scleroderma. On examination, the blood pressure was 140/91 mm Hg and other vital signs were normal. The weight was 76.2 kg. The oropharynx was pink, with numerous erosions of the mucous membranes of the mouth, including the tongue, soft palate, and inner buccal mucosa, without bleeding Fig. 1.

Schoenfeld Medicine: A 54-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain, vomiting, and confusion. The patient was in her usual health until approximately 3 days before admission, when she reportedly began to feel unwell, with weakness, chills, and skin that was abnormally warm to the touch. She self-administered aspirin, without improvement. During the next 2 days, her oral intake decreased. Approximately 22 hours before presentation, vomiting occurred. Nine hours before presentation, she began to travel home to Italy from the eastern United States. During the next 2 hours, increasing abdominal pain occurred, associated with vomiting and shortness of breath, and she took additional aspirin for pain. Approximately 2 hours before presentation, while the patient was in flight, abdominal pain markedly worsened, vomiting increased, and she became confused and unresponsive. The flight was diverted to Boston. On examination by emergency medical services personnel, she was nonverbal and was moaning continuously. The blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg, the pulse 52 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute. The capillary blood glucose level was 116 mg per deciliter 6.4 mmol per liter. She was brought to the emergency department at this hospital by ambulance. The patients history was obtained from her husband through an interpreter. She had noninsulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, nephro-lithiasis, and chronic kidney disease. Medications included enalapril, metformin, glimepiride, nimesulide, imipramine, aspirin, and ibuprofen. She had no known allergies. She was married and had children. She lived in Italy and did not speak English. She had vacationed in North America for 10 days, traveling to urban areas. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs, and there was no history of unusual ingestions. On examination, the patient was incoherent and appeared agitated and uncomfortable, with frequent groaning. She was oriented to person only and opened her eyes to command. The blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg, the pulse 52 beats per minute, the temperature 36.7C, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95 while she was breathing ambient air. The pupils were 3 mm in diameter and minimally reactive to light; the oral mucous membranes were dry, and the neck was supple. The abdomen was soft, without distention, rebound tenderness, or guarding. The skin was cool. The remainder of the general examination was normal. The neurologic examination was limited because of the patients inability to follow commands; she withdrew all extremities to pain, and cranial nerves and strength appeared normal. Normal saline was rapidly infused, and dextrose, insulin, on-dansetron, and morphine sulfate were administered intravenously. An electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 115 beats per minute and a QRS duration of 94 msec, with a tremulous baseline possibly obscuring ST-segment depression in the inferior leads. Blood levels of calcium, triglycerides, glycated hemoglobin, and haptoglobin were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Placement of an indwelling urinary catheter was followed by placement of intravascular catheters in the right external jugular vein and the femoral artery. Within 2 hours after the patients arrival in the emergency department, tachypnea and increasing somnolence developed; results of venous oximetry are shown in Table 1. The trachea was intubated after the administration of etomidate and rocuronium, and 100 oxygen was administered and bicarbonate was infused. A chest radiograph showed no evidence of pneumonia or pleural effusion. There were ill-defined calcifications in the soft tissue of the left breast. Approximately 3 hours after the patients arrival, the rectal temperature decreased to 31.7C and the blood pressure to 84/43 mm Hg. Norepi-nephrine bitartrate and bicarbonate were administered; fluids were warmed before infusion, and a blanket warmer was placed. Dark-brown gastric secretions that were positive for occult blood were aspirated through an orogastric tube; the gastric pH was 5.7. Dr. Raul N. Uppot: Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis without the administration of intravenous or oral contrast material Fig. 1 revealed pancreatic edema, peripancreatic fat stranding, a small amount of perihepatic and pericholecystic fluid without biliary ductal dilatation, some thickened walls in several loops of small bowel, and an atrophic left kidney containing a nonobstructing calculus. CT of the chest revealed dependent atelectasis, with no focal consolidation, masses, or effusions, and calcifications of the left breast. CT of the brain was normal. Dr. Schoenfeld: Cefepime, vancomycin, and met-ronidazole were administered intravenously. After laboratory results were known, sodium polystyrene sulfonate was given orally. Toxicologic screening of the blood and urine was negative. The patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit ICU. Vasopressin, propofol, and calcium were added, and additional bicarbonate and glucose were administered. Eight hours after her presentation, continuous venovenous hemo-filtration with bicarbonate solution was begun. Cultures of the blood and urine were obtained. Fourteen hours after presentation, the urine sodium level was 136 mmol per liter, and the urine creatinine level was 0.25 mg per milliliter. Echo-cardiography revealed normal global cardiac function, without pericardial effusion. Dr. Uppot: Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed small-volume ascites, nonspecific thickening of the gallbladder wall, and an atrophic left kidney; there was increased renal parenchymal echogenicity of both kidneys Fig. 2. Dr. Schoenfeld: During the first 17 hours, the patient had oliguria, with approximately 125 ml of urine excreted. Additional laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic test was performed.

A diagnosis of psoriasis was made; topical glucocorticoids and oral cephaloridine were administered, without improvement. Five months before admission, the rash worsened. On examination at another facility, there was reportedly an extensive erythroderma of the extremities that was thought to be psoriasis; prednisone was administered orally. Shortly thereafter, fever and leg swelling developed, and the patient was admitted to another hospital. On examination, the temperature was 38.1C, and the pulse 145 beats per minute. Over the extremities was a diffuse, scaly, erythematous rash with a small amount of serous drainage, and there was warm, nonpitting edema of the legs; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and B-natriuretic peptide were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation and liver and renal function; tests for rheumatoid factor, syphilis, and hepatitis B and C viruses were negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was normal. Pathological examination of a skin-biopsy specimen of the left leg showed psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia with parakeratosis, as well as a mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the superficial dermis, features suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction. A diagnosis of psoriasis complicated by cellulitis was made, and broad-spectrum antibiotics and prednisone were administered. Cultures of the skin grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and cultures of the blood were sterile. Fevers resolved, and the patient was discharged on the seventh day, taking dicloxacillin 10-day course, orally and topical glucocorticoids. During the next 4 months, the erythroderma persisted, with intermittent exacerbations attributed to cellulitis. Three months before admission to this hospital, while the patient was taking trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, urticaria developed, associated with peripheral-blood eosinophilia. Levels of cobalamin vitamin B12 and folate were normal; testing for antibodies to Strongyloides stercoralis IgG, tissue transglutam-inase antibody, and IgA endomysial antibody were negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. The administration of trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole was stopped, and prednisone and topical glucocorticoids were restarted, with improvement in the urticaria. Eight days before admission, fever to a temperature of 38.0C developed, with worsening pruritus, erythema, and swelling of both legs. The patient was readmitted to the other hospital. On examination, there was diffuse erythroder-ma and left axillary lymphadenopathy. Oxacillin, mupirocin ointment, and triamcinolone cream were administered. Blood cultures were sterile. Hemoglobin electrophoresis was normal; testing for antibodies to SSA Ro, SSB La, filaria, trichinella, and cysticercus was negative. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. A hematologist noted very few of what were possibly Sezary cells on a peripheral-blood smear. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells for the BCR, ABL, CHIC2, PDGFRA, and FIP1L1 gene regions was normal, and no clonal rearrangement of T-cellreceptor genes was detected. A chest radiograph was normal. Dr. Bethany L. Niell: Computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis Fig. 1 after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material revealed bilateral axillary lymph-adenopathy 3 cm in the short axis, bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy 4 cm, bilateral small pleural effusions, and stranding of the subcutaneous soft tissues of the pelvis, features consistent with the history of bilateral leg edema. No mediastinal, hilar, or intraabdominal lymph-adenopathy was identified. Dr. Larson: Cytologic examination of a fine-needle aspirate of an axillary lymph node revealed small lymphoid cells. Flow cytometry showed no evidence of an abnormal lymphocyte population. On the eighth day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. Medications on transfer included doxepin, hydroxyzine, enoxaparin, acetaminophen, and lorazepam, with topical triamcinolone and mupirocin. The patient reported pain with walking, diffuse itching, dizziness, weakness, occasional dia-phoresis and shaking chills, weight gain of approximately 9 kg in the previous 2 weeks, and chronic headaches. She had no history of blood transfusions. She was allergic to aspirin angio-edema. She was born in Puerto Rico and had moved to the Boston area 5 months earlier to live with relatives and seek medical attention. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her father had died of heart disease, her mother had Alzheimers disease and pancreatic disease, and two nieces had systemic lupus erythematosus. On examination, the temperature was 37.3C, the blood pressure 110/58 mm Hg, and the pulse 126 beats per minute; the respirations and oxygen saturation were normal. There was diffuse confluent erythroderma with superficial scaling and erosions, foci of lichenification, palmoplan-tar hyperkeratosis, and follicular prominence on the back Fig. 2A, 2B, and 2C. There was mada-rosis, bilateral small ectropion of the eyelids, and painful pitting edema of the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. Testing for syphilis, the human immunodeficiency virus, and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. Pathological examination of a skin-biopsy specimen from the left leg showed changes consistent with an eczema-tous process. Examination of a biopsy specimen of a left axillary lymph node showed dermato-pathic lymphadenitis; flow cytometry showed no abnormal lymphocyte populations. Flow cytom-etry on a specimen of peripheral blood showed 35 T cells with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 10, with 7 CD3CD7 cells, which also expressed CD4, and normal expression of other antigens see Fig. 1A in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Clobeta-sol ointment and urea 40 cream were applied topically, with some improvement. Examination of skin-biopsy specimens of the left and right legs, obtained on the sixth day, showed eczema-tous and interface dermatitis, dyskeratotic cells, and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. The patient was discharged later that day. During the next year, the patient had persistent erythroderma, progressive alopecia, and recurrent infections requiring hospitalization and treatment with antibiotics, topical glucocorti-coids, and intermittent high-dose prednisone. Further evaluation included extensive patch test-ing, which revealed no positive allergens, and multiple additional skin biopsies, which were nondiagnostic. Test results from this period are shown in Table 1; other tests for autoantibodies were negative, and levels of tryptase, IgG, and IgA were normal, as were the results of other screening tests. Eleven months after the patients initial admission to this hospital, pain and swelling developed around an intravenous catheter site while she was receiving nafcillin intravenously and taking oral prednisone 60 mg daily, and she was readmitted to this hospital. The catheter was removed, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered. Cultures of the blood were negative. Additional diagnostic procedures were performed.

Atopic dermatitis: The diffuse pruritic erythematous rash with evidence of a chronic eczematous process on biopsy and improved symptoms with topical glucocorticoids are suggestive of atopic dermatitis.\n5. Chronic actinic dermatitis: Given her geographic background and presentation of diffuse erythema and lichenification, chronic actinic dermatitis could be considered.\n6. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): Family history of SLE and the broad systemic symptoms warrant consideration of SLE, although autoimmune tests were negative.\n7. Contact dermatitis: Extensive patch testing revealing no positive allergens cannot entirely rule out contact dermatitis, possibly from undetected allergens or irritants.\n8. Lymphoma: Bilateral lymphadenopathy seen on CT and chronic systemic symptoms could be indicative of an underlying lymphoma.\n9. Erythrodermic psoriasis: The worsening of scaling and confluent erythema in response to prednisone points towards erythrodermic psoriasis, a severe variant of psoriasis.\n10.

Kaufman: A 71-year-old man was seen in the outpatient cancer center of this hospital because of gross hematuria and a mass in the bladder. The patient had been well until 6 weeks earlier, when painless hematuria had developed, with passage of clots, while he was traveling in a wilderness area. After 2 days, he saw a nurse practitioner at a local facility. Attempts at passing a catheter into his bladder were unsuccessful, and he was referred to a hospital in a larger city. Computed tomography CT performed without the administration of contrast material reportedly revealed a multilobulated mass isodense to hyper-dense and measuring 8 cm by 7.5 cm by 6.5 cm in the urinary bladder, diffuse fat stranding in the perivesical and left periurethral regions, and bilateral intrarenal calculi and cysts. The next day, cystoscopic examination revealed an open pros-tatic urethra and brisk bleeding, making visualization of the bladder difficult. A fungating lesion at the anterior bladder neck at the 12 oclock position, with an adherent clot, was partially excised. Laser ablation resulted in hemostasis. Pathological examination of the tissue reportedly showed focal adenocarcinoma in situ that was thought to be of bladder origin and was associated with bland papillary and glandular epithelium, with no evidence of invasion. Five days later, bleeding persisted, and the patient was transferred to a second hospital, near his home. Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed bilateral renal cysts and bilateral nonobstructing nephrolithiasis. The next day, repeat cystoscopy reportedly revealed a large fungating lesion and clot at the anterior bladder neck at the 12 oclock position. Flushing of the bladder and biopsies were performed. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimens reportedly showed adenocarcinoma; consultation with outside experts was pending. CT of the abdomen, performed the next day, reportedly revealed no evidence of metastatic disease. After decompression of the bladder with a catheter, irregular thickening of the bladder wall was seen, with an irregular, multiloculated gas collection, 2.5 cm by 3.5 cm, in the suprapubic region. The patient was discharged on the fifth day to follow up with his urologist. Nineteen days before this evaluation, trans-rectal biopsies of the prostate were performed with ultrasonographic guidance. Pathological examination of the specimens revealed adeno-carcinoma in one of two cores from the right base, with a Gleason score of 7 grade 3 plus grade 4 on a scale of 1 to 10 with higher scores indicating a worse prognosis, involving 30 of the tissue, and adenocarcinoma in a core from the left lateral midportion, with a Gleason score of 6 33, involving 10 of the tissue. The patient was referred to the cancer center of this hospital. He reported that hematuria and clot passage had resolved and that he felt well. He had a history of lower urinary tract symptoms and urinary retention, for which a trans-urethral resection of the prostate had been performed elsewhere 12 years earlier. Pathological examination of the tissue reportedly had shown an area of focal high-grade prostate intraepithe-lial neoplasia. Four subsequent prostatic biopsies, the most recent performed 4 years before this evaluation, were negative for cancer. Levels of prostate-specific antigen PSA, measured annually, had been normal until 5 days after the second cystoscopy, 1 month before this evaluation, when the level was 13.0 ng per milliliter reference range, 4.0. The patient also had erectile dysfunction, hy-pertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, hyper-lipidemia, diverticulosis, mild obstructive sleep apnea for which he used continuous positive air pressure at night, and nephrolithiasis, which was treated with lithotripsy. Results of a colonoscopy performed 1 year earlier were normal. Medications included atorvastatin and verapamil; other medications doxazosin, amlodipine, val-sartan, telmisartan, hydrochlorothiazide, potassium aminobenzoic acid, oxybutynin chloride, and potassium chloride supplement had recently been stopped. He was married, had adult children, and was retired from the shipping industry, where he had been exposed to asbestos. He was physically active in outdoor activities. He did not smoke or drink alcohol. There was no family history of urologic cancers. On examination, the pulse was 50 beats per minute and the blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were normal. The body-mass index the weight in ki-lograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 30.0. Rectal examination was not performed, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The blood potassium level was 3.3 mmol per liter reference range, 3.4 to 4.8, the creatinine level 1.3 mg per deciliter 115 mol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter 53 to 133 mol per liter, and the urea nitrogen level 15 mg per deciliter 5.4 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter 2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter; the estimated glo-merular filtration rate was 59 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area reference range, 60. The complete blood count and levels of other electrolytes, calcium, and glucose were normal. A diagnostic test was performed, and management decisions were made.

Bladder adenocarcinoma: The presence of a multilobulated mass, focal adenocarcinoma in situ on pathology, and persistence of hematuria strongly suggest primary bladder adenocarcinoma.\n2. Prostate adenocarcinoma: The Gleason scores of 7 and 6 in recent prostate biopsies indicate a significant possibility of concurrent prostate cancer contributing to urinary symptoms.\n3. Urothelial carcinoma: Given the hematuria, history of smoking, and the exposure to carcinogens such as asbestos, urothelial carcinoma of the bladder should be considered.\n4. Chronic nephrolithiasis: The identified bilateral intrarenal calculi and history of nephrolithiasis with lithotripsy could contribute to hematuria and urinary symptoms.\n5. Intravesical infection: The irregular thickening of the bladder wall and multiloculated gas collection in the suprapubic region could be indicative of an intravesical abscess or infection.\n6. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: While primarily a cardiac issue, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy could exacerbate symptoms via thromboembolic events or reduced renal perfusion.\n7. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): His history of lower urinary tract symptoms and urinary retention requiring TURP 12 years ago suggests possible resurgence of BPH.\n8. Renal cysts: Bilateral renal cysts noted on ultrasonography may contribute to persistent urinary symptoms and occasional hematuria.\n9.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Luke A. Neilans Medicine: A 46-year-old woman was seen in the emergency department at this hospital because of muscle pain and swelling in her arms and lower legs. The patient had been well until approximately 3 weeks before admission, when a deep ache developed in her left triceps, in the absence of trauma. During the following weeks, the pain persisted, gradually spreading to both arms and both legs, and was exacerbated by movement; she began having difficulty rising from chairs and climbing stairs because of pain. Two weeks before admission, examination by her primary care physician at another hospital reportedly revealed no focal muscle weakness. Red-cell indexes and blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, and glucose were normal, as were renal-function tests; testing for parvovirus B19 IgG and IgM antibodies was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Three days before admission, pain and swelling in the left arm worsened. She returned to the other hospital. Blood levels of alkaline phosphatase, direct and total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, and thyrotropin were normal, and testing for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus and Borrelia burgdorferi were negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. The patient returned home, with persistent symptoms. Three days later, she came to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient reported restricted range of motion of her arms because of pain, as well as stiffness in her proximal arm muscles that was worse in the morning. She also reported intermittent nondrenching night sweats that she attributed to menopause. She reported no muscle weakness, fever, chills, malaise, dysphagia, nasal regurgitation, synovitis, weight loss, numbness or tingling in her hands, shortness of breath, chest pain, changes in bowel or bladder function, nausea, vomiting, photosensitivity, or rash. A diagnosis of uterine fibroids with menorrhagia had been made 2 years earlier. Routine mammograms had been normal. Her only medication was megestrol acetate, taken midcycle 10 days per month. She had no known allergies. She was single, physically active, and had traveled widely. She drank alcohol in moderation, and she did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her mother had had breast cancer at age 65 years, and her father had had a myocardial infarction at age 57 years. There was no family history of rheumatologic or neuromuscular disorders. On examination, the blood pressure was 113/82 mm Hg, the pulse 101 beats per minute, the temperature 36.7C, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. When she was standing, her pulse increased to 120 beats per minute, without symptoms of dyspnea or light-headedness. Her voice was slightly gravelly, which she reported was unchanged. There was firm, nonpitting swelling and tenderness to palpation on the right shoulder and from the left shoulder to the hand. Both calves were tender to palpation, without visible swelling. Gait and muscle strength were normal, and she could easily squat, stand, and rise up on either foot on tiptoe. There was no rash, evidence of nail-bed infarcts, or impairment of respiratory excursions; the remainder of the examination was normal. The activated partial-thromboplastin time was normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glu-cose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, direct and total bilirubin, and thyrotropin. Results of renal-function tests were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed positive nitrites, 3 ketones, and trace occult blood and albumin; few bacteria, few squamous cells, and very few transitional cells were seen per high-power field. Screening of the urine for human chorionic gonadotropin hCG and toxins was negative. Ultrasonography of the left arm and right leg showed no deep venous thrombosis. Dr. Carol C. Wu: A chest radiograph showed a soft-tissue opacity, 9.0 cm by 9.0 cm by 12.4 cm, in the right lower hemithorax that obscured the right heart border, with no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema Fig. 1A. The opacity was seen anteriorly on the lateral view. The appearance was suggestive of an anterior mediastinal mass. Computed tomography CT after the administra-tion of intravenous contrast material Fig. 1B and 1C confirmed the presence of a large, anterior mediastinal soft-tissue mass with a smooth margin and heterogeneous density but with no evi-dence of internal calcification or fat. The mass abutted the right pericardium, with no distinct fat plane between the mass and the pericardium. There was no evidence of invasion into the pericardium. There was a small pericardial effusion. The superior vena cava was patent, but there was compression of the right atrium. There was no evidence of intrathoracic lymphadenopathy. There was no connection between the mass and the thyroid gland. The differential diagnosis included a thymic neoplasm, lymphoma, and a germ-cell tumor. In view of the absence of connection to the thyroid gland, a thyroid origin was unlikely. Lymphoma was considered to be unlikely in the absence of any other evidence of lymphadenopathy. Dr. Neilans: An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 111 beats per minute, left atrial enlargement, and minor, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Blood levels of parathyroid hormone, hCG, and alpha-fetoprotein were normal, and testing for antibodies to Ro, La, Sm, RNP, and Jo-1 was negative. On the third day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Inflammatory, necrotizing myopathy and myas-thenia gravis associated with thymoma. ", "prediction": "1. Thymic neoplasm: The large anterior mediastinal mass with a smooth margin and heterogeneous density, along with the compression of the right atrium and absence of other lymphadenopathy, strongly suggests a thymic tumor.\n2. Germ cell tumor: Anterior mediastinal masses can often be germ cell tumors, and the imaging findings, along with normal hCG and alpha-fetoprotein levels, suggest this as a potential diagnosis.\n3. Polymyalgia rheumatica: The patient's age, muscle pain, stiffness (particularly morning stiffness), and non-pitting swelling of the shoulders align with the classic presentation of polymyalgia rheumatica.\n4. Myositis: The muscle pain, tenderness, and swelling without focal muscle weakness could be indicative of an inflammatory myopathy such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis, despite the absence of positive specific muscle antibodies.\n5. Paraneoplastic syndrome: The presence of a mediastinal mass raises the possibility of a paraneoplastic syndrome causing systemic muscle symptoms.\n6. Sarcoidosis: Although less common, sarcoidosis can present with an anterior mediastinal mass along with muscle involvement, making it a consideration.\n7. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): The presence of muscle pain, non-specific laboratory findings, and absence of some specific autoantibodies does not rule out SLE as a diagnosis.\n8. Hypothyroidism: Given the normal thyrotropin level, this is less likely but hypothyroidism can also cause muscle pain, stiffness, and weakness.\n9. Chronic fatigue syndrome: The patient's ongoing pain, fatigue, and muscle symptoms could alternatively represent a case of chronic fatigue syndrome.\n10. Fibromyalgia: This diagnosis should be considered in a patient with widespread muscle pain and tenderness given the non-specific laboratory findings and absence of other definitive diagnoses."}

Patil Medicine: A 6.5-month-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of fever, rash, and thrombocytopenia. The patient was well until the day before admission, when his mother noted bruising on both medial thighs, which she attributed to use of a jumping chair. On the morning of admission, she noted increased bruising on his thighs and broken capillaries on his cheeks and eyelids. On examination at another hospital, he was active and behaviorally appropriate. The rectal temperature was 37.4C, the pulse 146 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 45 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. There were multiple scattered petechiae on the face, chest, and legs; the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory results are shown in Table 1. He was transferred to this hospital. The patient was active and developmentally normal. At 3 months of age, intermittent urticaria had developed when small amounts of a milk-based formula were given, mixed with breast milk. There was no history of trauma, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, or blood in the urine or stool. He was born to a primigravida by cesarean section because of preeclampsia, after full-term gestation. Immunizations were current, excluding influenza A H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccines. Acetaminophen had been administered for teething pain until 2 days before this presentation. He had no known allergies. He lived with his parents and two dogs, did not attend day care, and had no exposures to sick persons. A cousin of his mother had splenomegaly of unknown cause; there was no known family history of hematologic disorders. The vital signs and physical examination were unchanged. The ABO blood type was A, Rh-positive, with negative screening for antibodies to red cells. Blood levels of electrolytes, phosphorus, magnesium, urea nitrogen, direct and total bilirubin, glucose, amylase, and lipase were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation and liver function; other test results are shown in Table 1. Anti-RhD immune globulin referred to as anti-D 550 g 50 g per kilogram of body weight was administered intravenously. Test results from the next day are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures drawn at the other hospital remained sterile, and the patient was discharged home. Subsequent outpatient evaluation revealed platelet counts of 120,000 per cubic millimeter on the second day after discharge and 32,000 per cubic millimeter on the sixth day after discharge; the hematocrit was 28.1, the hemoglobin level 9.6 g per deciliter, and reticulocytes 16.6. Ten days after discharge, the platelet count was 1000 per cubic millimeter. The patient was readmitted to this hospital. The pulse was 139 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the weight 11.2 kg; other vital signs were normal. There were isolated petechiae on the tongue and fine petechiae on the face and thighs. Test results are shown in Table 1. Intravenous immune globulin was infused, and the patient was discharged the next day. During the next 9 days, testing for antinuclear antibody was positive at a 1:40 dilution and negative at 1:80 and 1:160 dilutions normal, negative at 1:40 and 1:160 dilutions with a speckled pattern, and testing for anti-granulocyte antibodies was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. When the patient was 8 months of age, a diagnosis of milk allergy was made based on the presence of urticaria, diarrhea, and radioallergo-sorbent testing, and soy-based formula was begun. Diarrhea resolved, but he vomited frequently. Two months after the first admission, when the patient was 8.5 months of age, fever to a temperature of 38.9C developed that was unresponsive to outpatient ceftriaxone therapy. This was followed by worsening diarrhea, nonbilious emesis, and increasing lethargy over a period of several days, as well as fever to a temperature of 40C. Blood cultures were sterile. He was readmitted to this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 40C, the pulse 160 beats per minute, the blood pressure 101/56 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 11.7 kg. Nasopharyngeal tests for influenza A and B viruses were negative, as were stool tests for enteric pathogens, Clostridium difficile toxin, rotavirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, and ova and parasites. Testing for reducing substances in the stool and urine was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Blood and urine cultures were sterile. Results of renal ultrasonography were normal. Ibuprofen, intravenous fluids, and ceftriaxone were administered. Parenteral nutrition was administered for 3 days; fever and diarrhea resolved. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. A hypoallergenic formula was introduced. The patient was discharged home on the sixth day to take cefixime a 2-week course and acetaminophen as needed.

Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP): The acute onset of bruising, petechiae, and severe thrombocytopenia without significant evidence of bone marrow failure or secondary causes supports the diagnosis.\n2. Viral Infection: Viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus are known to cause thrombocytopenia, fever, and rash in pediatric patients.\n3. Sepsis: Despite negative cultures, a bacterial infection could initially present with nonspecific signs such as fever, lethargy, thrombocytopenia, and emesis.\n4. Drug-Induced Thrombocytopenia: The recent use of medications such as acetaminophen and ceftriaxone could contribute to thrombocytopenia as an adverse effect.\n5. Autoimmune Disorder: Positive antinuclear antibody testing hints at the possibility of an underlying autoimmune disorder, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, manifesting with thrombocytopenia.\n6. Kawasaki Disease: This condition can present with prolonged fever, rash, and thrombocytopenia and should be considered given the recurrent high fevers and rash.\n7. Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS): Although less likely due to the lack of significant renal involvement, HUS can present with thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and sometimes fever.\n8. Leukemia: The combination of thrombocytopenia, anemia, and systemic symptoms raises concern for leukemia, which should be ruled out with a bone marrow examination.\n9. Inherited Thrombocytopenia: Given the family history of splenomegaly, congenital thrombocytopenic syndromes should be considered, although usually present earlier in life.\n10. Milk Protein Allergy: The history of urticaria, vomiting, and diarrhea in response to formula feeding points to a possible milk protein allergy exacerbating the patient's condition."}

Wong Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital: A 32-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus HIV infection was admitted to a hospital in Durban, South Africa, because of dyspnea and cough. The hospital is associated with Massachusetts General Hospital. Five months before admission, the patient was seen in an outpatient clinic in South Africa for evaluation of a lesion on his left upper eyelid. On examination, violaceous, raised lesions were present on the left eyelid and right side of the chest Fig. 1A. Dr. Pratistadevi K. Ramdial: Pathological examination of an excisional biopsy specimen of the chest lesion showed a malignant vasoformative tumor of the dermis. The tumor was composed of a nodular spindle-cell infiltrate arranged in short, interlacing bundles, with intervening slitlike vasculature and angiomatous foci. Intratumoral hemosiderin pigment, erythrocyte extravasation, hyaline globules, and a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate were conspicuous findings Fig. 1B. Immuno-histochemical staining for human herpesvirus 8 HHV-8 confirmed nuclear im-munoreactivity in the spindle cells Fig. 1C. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of Kaposis sarcoma. Dr. Wong: An antibody test was positive for HIV type 1 HIV-1, and the CD4 T-lymphocyte count was 330 per cubic millimeter reference range, 500 to 2010. In preparation for the initiation of antiretroviral therapy ART, the patient completed pretreatment classes. During the next 3 months, new skin lesions appeared on the thighs. Sixteen weeks before admission, a productive cough developed. Two weeks later, a specimen of sputum was negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis by polymerase-chain-reaction PCR testing and acid-fast bacilli staining and culture. The CD4 T-lymphocyte count was 268 per cubic millimeter. Dr. Pumersha Naidoo: A chest radiograph obtained 14 weeks before admission showed nodular opacities, 5 to 7 mm in diameter, in both lungs, most prominently in the middle and lower zones; there was loss of definition of the right hilum, with irregular peribronchovascular thickening and air bronchograms. No pleural effusions, hilar lymphadenopathy, or paraspinal masses were seen Fig. 2A. Dr. Wong: Eleven weeks before admission, therapy with tenofovir, lamivudine, and efavirenz was begun. A chest radiograph at the time of the initiation of ART revealed no changes. One week later, the patient was seen in the infectious diseases clinic at the hospital for evaluation of worsening productive cough, daily fevers of 2 weeks duration, weight loss of 2 kg, and night sweats. He reported full adherence with the ART regimen and noted no change in his skin lesions during the week he was receiving therapy. On examination, the temperature was normal. Small, violaceous lesions were noted on the left upper eyelid and thighs, with a healed surgical scar on the right side of the chest. The lungs and the remainder of the examination were normal. Additional sputum specimens were obtained; PCR testing and acid-fast bacilli staining and cultures for M. tuberculosis were negative. The patient returned home. Symptoms persisted, and a presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was made. Seven weeks before admission, the administration of rifampin, pyrazinamide, etham-butol, and isoniazid was begun. Worsening dyspnea, cough, malaise, anorexia, and an additional weight loss of 8 kg developed during the next 7 weeks, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. He reported increased numbers of skin lesions since his last visit, 10 weeks earlier. He had had a painless mass in the left inguinal region for the past 5 years, which he thought was a hernia caused by lifting weights. Approximately 3 weeks after the initiation of ART, the mass erupted and drained purulent material. Medications on admission included antiretroviral and antituberculous medications. The patient was born and lived in South Africa. He reported being heterosexual and monogamous with his wife. He had drunk alcohol socially until the onset of this illness; he did not smoke or use illicit drugs. His parents reportedly died of old age; his five siblings were healthy. He had no known exposure to tuberculosis. On examination, the patient appeared cachec-tic, with temporal wasting. The oxygen saturation ranged between 93 and 96 while he was breathing ambient air, and dyspnea developed with minimal exertion. The blood pressure was 95/63 mm Hg, and the pulse 120 beats per minute. There were crepitations over the left middle and lower lung fields; the liver edge was palpable 2 cm below the costal margin, and the spleen tip was palpable. Violaceous skin lesions were present on the legs, arms, torso, palate, and left eyelid. There was lymphadenopathy in the cervical and axillary regions, with a draining lymph node and a groove sign visible separation of enlarged inguinal and femoral lymph nodes by the inguinal ligament in the left groin. The blood levels of electrolytes, bilirubin, phosphorus, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal, as were the platelet count, red-cell indexes, and results of renal-function tests. The results of screening tests for hepatitis A and B viruses were consistent with immunity from previous exposure, and the results of screening for hepatitis C virus were negative; other results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Naidoo: A chest radiograph showed marked progression of previous radiographic findings Fig. 2B. There was extensive central perihilar and peribronchovascular confluent consolidation. Irregular nodular opacities were seen in the periphery of both lung fields, with some in the left upper lobe showing possible cavitation or air bronchograms. There were no pleural effusions. Dr. Wong: Grams staining of a sputum specimen revealed scanty gram-positive cocci, and a culture grew normal respiratory flora; Ziehl Neelsen and auramine staining, direct fluorescence antibody testing for P. jirovecii, and a myco-bacterial culture were negative. Theadministration of antiretroviral and antituberculous medications was continued, and doxycycline, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, prednisone, and oxygen 40, administered through a nonrebreather face mask were added. Diagnostic procedures were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Cutaneous and visceral (pulmonary) Kaposi’s sarcoma.

Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS): The patient's worsening symptoms post-initiation of ART suggest IRIS, which is a paradoxical worsening of preexisting infections due to immune system recovery.\n2. Kaposi's Sarcoma Pulmonary Involvement: Given the patient's known Kaposi's sarcoma and respiratory symptoms, pulmonary involvement of Kaposi's sarcoma is highly likely.\n3. Bacterial Pneumonia: The presence of bacteria on Gram stain and the patient's symptoms could indicate a secondary bacterial pneumonia.\n4. Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia (PCP): Despite negative initial tests, the patient's degree of immunosuppression and progressive respiratory symptoms could still be consistent with PCP.\n5. Disseminated Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC) Infection: The patient's advanced HIV and systemic symptoms could indicate disseminated MAC, especially as pulmonary findings may also occur.\n6. Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma: The patient’s lymphadenopathy, weight loss, and systemic symptoms could suggest a hematologic malignancy such as non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.\n7. Reactivation Tuberculosis: Although initial TB tests were negative, the patient could still have reactivation TB, common in immunocompromised individuals.\n8. Histoplasmosis: Endemic mycoses such as histoplasmosis could present similarly in a patient with HIV/AIDS living in areas where these fungi are prevalent.\n9. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Pneumonitis: The patient's immunosuppressive state predisposes him to CMV, which could present with pulmonary infiltration.\n10.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Isaac I. Bogoch Infectious Diseases: A 19-year-old man was admitted to this hospital in early spring because of otalgia, slurred speech, and ataxia. The patient had been well until approximately 1 month before admission, when fatigue, fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy developed. Twenty-five days before admission, he went to another medical facility, where a test for streptococcal pharyngitis was negative. Eight days later, a heterophile antibody test was positive and the hematocrit, hemoglobin, and blood levels of total protein, albumin, and total and direct bilirubin were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis due to EpsteinBarr virus EBV infection was made. Two weeks before admission, dysphagia developed and pain and decreased hearing occurred in the right ear. On repeat evaluation, a diagnosis of otitis media was made, and prednisone 45 mg daily, for 5 days and amoxicillin for 2 days were administered, followed by azithromycin for 3 days. Eight days before admission, severe otalgia developed. On examination by an otolaryngologist, there was perforation of the right tympanic membrane, with bloody purulent material in the external ear canal. Oral cefuroxime 500 mg twice daily and an otic suspension of topical ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone were prescribed. Two days later, increasing unsteadiness developed; the patient fell several times during the next 5 days. The day before admission, he returned to the otolaryngologist; on examination, there was an effusion in the right middle ear. Myringotomy, with fluid aspiration, was performed. After the procedure, transient unsteadiness occurred, with vomiting; ear pain lessened, and hearing partially improved. After returning home, the patient noted slurred speech, clumsiness with movements, and increasing gait imbalance. Later that night, he went to the emergency department at another hospital. Ceftriaxone 1 g was administered, and he was transferred to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient reported fullness and decreased hearing in the right ear, weight loss of 4.5 kg, and persistent fatigue during the previous month, without neck stiffness, headache, photophobia, changes in vision, tinnitus, vertigo, sensory abnormalities, or difficulty with comprehension. He had a history of acne, asthma, and otitis media during childhood; he had undergone an inguinal herniorrhaphy as an infant. Medications at home included a combination of oxycodone and acetaminophen for otalgia and topical benzoyl peroxide. He had no known allergies. He attended college. He did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His paternal grandfather had polymyalgia rheumatica at 75 years of age and a stroke at 80 years of age; there was no other family history of neurologic or rheumatologic diseases. On examination, the patient was thin, alert, and oriented, with an appropriate affect. The vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. The right tympanic membrane was perforated, with dried blood in the external canal. The tonsils were enlarged 3 and erythematous. His speech was fluent and mildly dysarthric. Extraocular movements revealed slight saccadic undershoot, normal pursuit, and no nystagmus. Hearing comprehension of whispered words was slightly diminished in the right ear. He had dysmetria bilaterally on finger-to-nose testing, with end-point tremor; rapid alternating movements were irregular, and there was overshooting bilaterally when the patient attempted to follow the rapid finger movements of the examiner. Heel-to-shin testing was intact, but there was marked truncal ataxia with standing and walking. The remainder of the general and neurologic examinations was normal, including repetition and naming, strength, deep-tendon and plantar reflexes, and sensory examinations. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and platelet count were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, total protein, albumin, lipase, total and indirect bilirubin, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, vitamin B12, cholesterol, and lipo-proteins. Results of renal-function tests were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Mary E. Cunnane: Computed tomography CT of the brain and temporal bones, performed without the administration of contrast material Fig. 1A and 1B, reveals fluid in the right middle ear and mastoid air cells and hemorrhage within the right external auditory canal, findings that are consistent with the recent tympanostomy. There is no associated bony destruction, and both the roof of the middle ear and the roof of the mastoid are intact. The brain is normal in appearance. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the brain, performed without the administration of gadolinium, reveals opacification of the right mastoid air cells and middle ear, as well as prominent adenoids and cervical lymph nodes. No abnormality is evident in the brain, and the findings are otherwise normal. Dr. Bogoch: The patient was admitted to the hospital. Results of a lumbar puncture are shown in Table 1. The oral administration of cefurox-ime 250 mg twice daily was started by the admitting service. Dr. Cunnane: On the second day, repeat MRI of the brain with the administration of gadolinium was performed. Images from the MRI scan show unchanged opacification in the right mastoid air cells and middle ear Fig. 1C and 1D. There is no extraaxial fluid collection, acute infarction, mass lesion or mass effect, or signal abnormality or enhancement in the brain parenchyma. A magnetic resonance venogram shows normal flow-related enhancement in the dural venous sinuses, without evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or stenosis. A CT scan of the skull base, obtained after the administration of contrast material, shows opacification of the right middle ear and mastoid air cells, with no destruction of bony mastoid septa. The tegmen tympani and tegmen mastoideum are intact. Dr. Bogoch: Cefuroxime was stopped, vanco-mycin and ceftriaxone were administered intravenously, and antihistamines and metoclopramide were also administered. The patients symptoms persisted. On neurologic examination on the fourth hospital day, the patient was awake and cooperative but inattentive, with mild anomia and impaired verbal fluency and verbal working memory. Comprehension was normal. The ability to perform simple arithmetic was impaired, and he persever-ated when performing the Luria fist-palm-side test of alternating motor sequencing, which is sensitive to executive dysfunction from lesions of the prefrontal cortex.1 Eye movements showed continued hypometric saccades and catch-up to both the left and the right sides. Speech was mildly dysarthric. He had hypotonia throughout. There was dysdiadochokinesia in both arms and dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing. There was proximal overshoot on heel-to-shin testing. The gait was wide-based and unsteady, and the patient veered to either side. He was unable to perform tandem walking and lost his balance when standing with his feet together. The remainder of the examination, which included Weber and Rinne tests and tests of visual fields, strength, deep-tendon and plantar reflexes, and sensation, was normal. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Acute infectious mononucleosis due to Epstein– Barr virus infection, complicated by acute otitis media and postinfectious cerebellitis. ", "prediction": "1. Infectious mononucleosis-associated encephalitis: Given the recent confirmed EBV infection, central nervous system involvement such as encephalitis could explain neurological symptoms like ataxia and dysarthria.\n2. Labyrinthitis: The patient's history of otitis media, tympanic membrane perforation, and persistent otalgia suggests the possibility of an inner ear infection leading to balance issues.\n3. Acute cerebellar ataxia: Symptoms of dysmetria, truncal ataxia, and unsteady gait are characteristic of cerebellar ataxia, potentially secondary to a post-infectious state.\n4. Meningitis: Given the patient’s symptoms and recent ear infection, bacterial or viral meningitis could be considered, despite no neck stiffness.\n5. Mastoiditis: Fluid in the mastoid air cells visible on imaging and recent middle ear infection suggest a severe complication of otitis media leading to systemic symptoms.\n6. Brain abscess: The patient's severe neurological symptoms and history of ear infection raise the possibility of an abscess, even though initial imaging did not show mass lesions.\n7. Autoimmune encephalitis: The subacute presentation with cognitive deficits, dysarthria, and ataxia suggests an autoimmune etiology triggered by recent infections.\n8. Stroke: While less likely given the normal imaging findings, the sudden onset of neurological symptoms warrants the consideration of a cerebral vascular event.\n9. Drug-induced cerebellar toxicity: The use of multiple antibiotics and other medications may have adverse effects leading to cerebellar symptoms.\n10.

The patient was reportedly well until unintentional weight loss occurred approximately 6 weeks before presentation. Three weeks before presentation, upper abdominal pain developed that the patient rated at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The pain radiated to his throat, increased after eating and drinking, and did not diminish with ibuprofen. At the outpatient clinic, the patient reported nausea, occasional vomiting, decreased food intake, and a loss of 10 kg from his usual weight of 64.4 kg. He reported no headaches, visual changes, neck stiffness, dyspnea, substernal chest pain, lower abdominal pain, diarrhea, back pain, dysuria, rashes, or joint pain. He had had a respiratory illness approximately 2 years before this evaluation. He had no known allergies. He was born in Central America and had been living in the United States for 4 years. He worked in agriculture and did not speak English. He smoked cigars occasionally, drank alcohol infrequently, and did not use illicit drugs. On examination, the patient appeared cachectic. The temperature was 37.3C, the blood pressure 101/68 mm Hg, the pulse 114 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while he was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds and without tenderness or distention. There was macular hyperpigmentation of the feet and legs that reportedly had not changed for 10 years. The remainder of the examination was normal. Urinalysis revealed 1 protein and was otherwise normal. Ranitidine was prescribed, and the patient returned home with instructions to follow up the next day when test results were available. Blood levels of glucose, calcium, phosphorus, lipase, and amylase were normal, as were the results of tests of liver and renal function. Testing for antibodies to hepatitis C virus was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Carol C. Wu: A frontal chest radiograph showed subtle, tiny nodules throughout both lungs, without focal consolidation Fig. 1A. There was no evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Dr. Reza: Two days later, the patient returned to the outpatient clinic. He reported persistent abdominal pain that he rated at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, as well as sore throat, fever, and one episode of hematemesis that had occurred the day before. He reported no cough, congestion, or improvement with ranitidine. The temperature was 38.3C, the blood pressure 105/65 mm Hg, the pulse 119 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. There were coarse breath sounds at both lung bases. The abdomen was firm, without distention, masses, guarding, or rebound; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Airborne precautions were instituted, and a face mask was placed. Acetaminophen was administered, and a tuberculin skin test was performed. The patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital. He was heterosexual and reported having no more than eight partners in his lifetime and consistently using condoms. There was no known history of exposure to tuberculosis. On examination, the temperature was 35.9°C, the blood pressure 100//65 mm Hg, the pulse 68 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 47.6 kg, the height 160 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 18.6. A white exudate was present on the underside of the tongue. A nontender, mobile lymph node, 1 to 2 cm in diameter, was present in the left submandibular chain, and additional nontender, mobile lymph nodes were present in the right submental region and the right cervical region. Fine rales were scattered throughout both lungs, and the abdomen was soft; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Blood levels of glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, lipase, and amylase were normal, as were the results of tests of liver and renal function; other test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Wu: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material revealed numerous nodules, 1 to 3 mm in diameter, randomly distributed in a miliary pattern (i.e., having an appearance that is similar to millet seeds [Figure 2]) in both lungs, without mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy (Figure 1B and 1C). To help evaluate the patient's abdominal pain, a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained that showed multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes and new, small bilateral pleural effusions. The mesenteric lymph nodes had low-attenuation centers that were suggestive of central necrosis (Figure 1D). There was no evidence of bowel dilatation or bowel-wall thickening. Dr. Reza: Specimens of blood, sputum, and urine were obtained. Intravenous saline and one dose of ceftriaxone and azithromycin were administered, followed by fluconazole, omeprazole, and nystatin suspension. Results of coagulation tests were normal.

Desai Medicine: A 55-year-old woman with a history of autoimmune hepatitis was admitted to this hospital because of increasing lethargy, anorexia, and abdominal pain. Approximately 7 years before this admission, the patient received a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis at another hospital, and she began taking prednisone. During the next 6 years, splenomegaly, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, jaundice, and lethargy occurred, as did recurrent episodes of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and encephalopathy. A diagnosis of portal hypertension was made, and approximately 6 months before this admission, a transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt TIPS procedure was performed at another hospital. Approximately 3.5 months before this admission, the patient moved to Massachusetts. The following week, she was seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of intermittent headaches, weakness, dizziness, fatigue, and increasing abdominal and ankle swelling. She also had a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her medications included pred-nisone, lactulose, omeprazole, rifaximin, neomycin, ursodiol, lisinopril, folate, potassium chloride, and insulin. On examination, the patients vital signs were normal. Conjunctival injection and icterus, subconjunctival hemorrhages, and 2 pedal edema were present bilaterally, and the abdomen was soft, without tenderness or guarding; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of urea nitrogen, globulin, magnesium, amylase, and N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Ultrasonography of the abdomen with noninvasive Doppler evaluation of the abdominal vasculature revealed splenomegaly, 19 cm in maximal diameter normal range, 14 cm, and patency of the TIPS. The patient was advised to continue her medications at home, and referrals to a primary care physician and a hepatologist were made. Nine days later, the patient was found unresponsive on the floor at home. On examination by emergency medical services personnel, the capillary blood glucose level ranged from 30 to 39 mg per deciliter 1.7 to 2.2 mmol per liter; a glucose infusion was administered, and her condition improved. She was admitted to this hospital. Her physical and laboratory evaluations and imaging studies had not changed from previous examinations. She was discharged home on the second day. During the next month, testing for antinuclear antibody was positive at 1:40 and 1:160 dilutions, with a speckled pattern, and tests for antibodies to smooth muscle and viral hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Eight weeks before the current admission, she was readmitted to this hospital because of increasing fatigue and confusion of 1 weeks duration; she reportedly had stopped taking many of her medications. On examination, she was oriented only to self. The vital signs were normal, the skin jaundiced, the conjunctivae hyperemic, and the abdomen distended and soft, without tenderness. There was 1 peripheral edema, and the remainder of the general and neurologic examination, except mental status, was normal. An electrocardiogram ECG showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities. The glycated hemoglobin level was normal, testing for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus and parvovirus B19 was negative, and the result of a test for EpsteinBarr virus suggested past infection; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed 3 glucose 1000 mg per deciliter and 1 bilirubin, with 20 to 50 white cells, 3 to 5 red cells, few bacteria and squamous cells, and very few transitional cells per high-power field; calcium oxalate and mucin were present. Abdominal ultrasonogra-phy did not reveal a substantial amount of ascites. The patients medications were readministered and her mental status improved. A urine culture grew moderate mixed bacteria, and ciprofloxa-cin was administered for 3 days. The patient was discharged on the fourth day. On follow-up examination on an outpatient basis, increasing peripheral edema was treated with spironolactone and a short course of furosemide, and the condition improved. Insulin was administered on a sliding scale for glucose levels that were as high as 512 mg per deciliter 28.4 mmol per liter. The thyrotropin level was 6.17 U per milliliter reference range, 0.40 to 5.00, and the level of free thyroxine T4 was normal. Five days before the current admission, the patient returned to this hospital because of confusion, increasing lethargy, nonradiating mid-abdominal pain, and vomiting. An abdominal ultrasound examination was performed to as-sess the patency of the TIPS. Transverse images, obtained with and without the use of color-flow Doppler techniques, showed a patent TIPS, with normal velocities and hepatopetal flow in the main portal vein. Splenomegaly was also noted, with the spleen measuring 19.5 cm in maximal diameter. Furosemide was administered intravenously and then orally, and other medications were continued, with symptomatic improvement. Hepatology consultants calculated a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease MELD score of 20 on a scale of 6 to 40, with higher scores indicating more severe disease, and an outpatient evaluation for liver transplantation was recommended. The blood level of IgA was 561 mg per deciliter reference range, 69 to 309; blood levels of IgG and IgM were normal, with a normal pattern and without a detectable M component, and a follow-up measurement of blood levels of lactic acid was also normal. Dr. Sheela Agarwal: Magnetic resonance imaging of the liver performed after the intravenous administration of gadolinium revealed marked morphologic features of nodular cirrhosis and signs of portal hypertension, including spleno-megaly 19 cm in maximal diameter, upper abdominal varices, and a small amount of ascites. The main portal vein appeared patent, with proper positioning of the TIPS Fig. 1. Dr. Desai: The patient was discharged on the fourth day, with the plan that a visiting nurse would follow up. The next day, the patients anorexia and leg edema were exacerbated, and her oral intake decreased. Constant, ill-defined midabdominal pain occurred, without fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematuria, hematochezia, melena, chest pain, dyspnea, lightheadedness, or syncope. She returned to this hospital the following day. The patients medications included prednisone, lactulose, rifaximin, furosemide, spironolactone, glimepiride, insulin, neomycin, potassium chloride, folic acid, lisinopril, ursodiol, calcium and vitamin D supplements, and omeprazole. She was allergic to intravenous contrast material, which caused angioedema. She was born in Central America, spoke only Spanish, and immigrated to the United States more than 25 years previously. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There was no family history of liver or other gastrointestinal disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or cardiac disease. On examination, the temperature was 37.1C; the other vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. The patient had a depressed affect. There were bilateral subconjunctival hemorrhages and diffuse jaundice. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds and epigastric and mild lower abdominal tenderness during deep palpation and without distention, hepatomegaly, or a palpable spleen. There was no evidence of as-terixis, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. An ECG was unchanged, as compared with the ECG obtained 8 weeks before this admission. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Outpatient medications were continued; ceftriaxone and metronidazole were administered intravenously, and nutritional supplements were provided. Dr. Agarwal: On the second day, computed tomography CT of the abdomen performed after the oral administration of contrast material revealed cirrhosis with splenomegaly span, 16.2 cm and a TIPS in the proper position. In addition, diffuse wall thickening within the cecum and ascending colon, pericolonic fat stranding, and surrounding subcentimeter lymph nodes were present Fig. 2. The differential diagnosis for these findings includes ischemic, infectious, and inflammatory causes, although the right-sidedness is suggestive of neutropenic colitis. Dr. Desai: Hypotension, to 75/45 mm Hg, developed 2.5 hours after CT was performed. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Normal saline was infused, albumin and 4 units of red cells were transfused, and antihypertensive agents and diuretics were stopped; there was gradual improvement in blood pressure. Blood specimens were obtained for culture, and vancomycin, linezo-lid, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime were administered. Later that day, melena occurred. On the fifth day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Invasive fungal infection of the stomach. ", "prediction": "1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of autoimmune hepatitis, portal hypertension, and recent confusion, hepatic encephalopathy is a likely diagnosis, exacerbated by her possible nonadherence to medications.\n2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient's history of ascites and recurrent bacterial peritonitis raises the likelihood of SBP, despite the absence of fever or chills.\n3. Sepsis: Hypotension, confusion, and systemic inflammatory response could indicate a septic state, potentially due to her underlying immunocompromised state from chronic liver disease and diabetes.\n4. Cirrhosis-Related Portal Hypertension Complications: Chronic liver disease and recent imaging showing splenomegaly and portal hypertension increase the possibility of complications like variceal bleeding.\n5. Acute on Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF): The combination of cirrhosis, elevated MELD score, recent encephalopathy, and worsening jaundice suggests acute decompensation of chronic liver disease.\n6. Hypoglycemia: The documented episodes of low blood glucose requiring intervention and the use of diabetes medications could lead to recurrent severe hypoglycemia causing confusion and lethargy.\n7. Adrenal Insufficiency: Long-term prednisone therapy could result in secondary adrenal insufficiency, which may manifest as lethargy, abdominal pain, and hypotension.\n8. Diuretic-Induced Electrolyte Imbalance: Chronic use of diuretics like furosemide and spironolactone, combined with her symptoms of fatigue and anorexia, might lead to an electrolyte imbalance, contributing to her overall condition.\n9. Neutropenic Enterocolitis (Typhilitis): The CT findings of right-sided colonic thickening and pericolonic fat stranding are suggestive of neutropenic colitis, especially in an immunocompromised host.\n10.

The patient was in her usual health until approximately 15 months earlier, when abdominal bloating and intermittent rectal pain and bleeding developed. On examination by a colorectal surgeon, palpation of the levator ani muscle replicated the pain. Flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed internal hemorrhoids. Diagnoses of levator ani muscle spasm and irritable bowel syndrome were made. Five months before presentation, intermittent nausea and eructation developed; rectal pain and constipation persisted, with occasional blood in the stool after straining. Four months later, repeat flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed no new findings. Nausea with coughing up or vomiting a small amount of blood, anorexia, epigastric and left upper quadrant pain, increased bloating, and gas developed, with one episode of diarrhea. The patient went to the emergency department at another hospital, where computed tomography CT reportedly revealed a possible fullness in the body and tail of the pancreas i.e., the distal pancreas. During the next week, constipation alternated with diarrhea, without melena or hematochezia. Nausea was most severe 20 minutes after eating; she took antacids and famotidine, without improvement. Two days before this evaluation, anorexia developed, and she stopped eating. Her husband brought her to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient reported pain in the epigastrium, left upper quadrant, midback, and left lower flank, as well as a 4.5-kg weight loss during the previous 3 weeks, decreased energy and concentration, and three episodes of small-volume hematemesis. She reported disruptive thoughts, including that she had cancer of the pancreas, stomach, or another organ and would die young; she spent most daytime hours on the Internet researching her symptoms and writing about her condition and had difficulty caring for her children. Her sleep was normal. She reported no suicidal or homicidal ideation, although her husband reported that she had said that if this was pancreatic cancer I am going to kill myself. Two years before this evaluation, postpartum mastitis had developed in the patient, along with anxiety that she had inflammatory breast cancer. She sought treatment from two primary care physicians PCPs and multiple specialists, despite advice not to do so. Laboratory-test results, magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the spine, mammography, and breast ultrasonography were reportedly negative. She was admitted to a 2-week day-treatment program at a psychiatric hospital. Sertraline up to 200 mg daily, clonaz-epam, gabapentin, and ibuprofen were administered, with partial improvement. After discharge, she reported that she was concerned about metastatic melanoma and multiple myeloma, and she consulted specialists; examination of skin-biopsy specimens and skeletal radiographs were negative. She continued outpatient counseling and behavioral therapy, and sertraline was tapered because her anxiety diminished and she had concerns about weight gain. She had a history of attention deficithyperactivity disorder ADHD, for which she had taken bupropion and a combination of dextroamphetamine and amphetamine in the past; she also had a history of uterine fibroids. Medications included sertraline 75 mg daily and clonazepam 0.5 mg twice daily. She had no known allergies. She was married, lived with her husband and two young children, and had recently moved to another state for her husbands employment. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had a history of depression with suicide attempts; her father had hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and lung and colon cancer; her paternal grandmother had colon cancer; her maternal grandmother had leukemia; and her sister and children were healthy. On examination, the vital signs were normal; the weight was 62.4 kg 10 kg less than 1 month earlier. The abdomen was soft, with epigastric and left upper quadrant tenderness, without rebound. She appeared anxious and sad and was intermittently tearful, with frequent hand-wringing and restating of a belief that she had cancer. The remainder of the examination was normal. Routine laboratory studies were normal. Urinalysis revealed 3 ketones, 1 blood, and a few squamous cells and bacteria per high-power field. Testing for urinary human chorionic gonado-tropin and for blood in the stool was negative. On review, the CT of the abdomen performed at the other hospital was interpreted as normal.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Minjee Kim Neurology: A 69-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of dizziness and vomiting. The patient had been well until 4:15 a.m. on the day of admission, when he became dizzy, diaphoretic, and weak and had sensations of rocking and counterclockwise movement after he rolled onto his stomach in bed. The symptoms improved when he rolled into the supine position, and he slept until 7 a.m.; on awakening, the symptoms recurred. When walking, he sensed he was tilting to the left but did not fall. The symptoms worsened throughout the morning; they were most severe with head movements and were associated with increasing nausea and, after 10 a.m., vomiting. He called his doctors office because of concern that he was having a stroke. He was advised to go the hospital and called emergency medical services. On examination, his skin was pale and dry and the blood pressure was 148/60 mm Hg; the other vital signs and the remainder of the examination were normal. He was brought to the emergency department at this hospital, arriving approximately 9 hours after the onset of symptoms. The patient reported facial tingling in the area surrounding the eyes, including the malar eminence, and a mild headache. He noted that his visual perception momentarily lagged behind his eye movements, and the lag was more severe when looking to the right than to the left. He had no diplopia, blurred vision, tinnitus, decreased hearing, difficulty swallowing, changes in sensation or strength, palpitations, chest pain, fever, or shortness of breath. He reported an episode of self-limited positional vertigo that had occurred several years earlier. He had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, asthma, sleep apnea for which he intermittently used continuous positive airway pressure at night, depression, meralgia paresthetica a painful mononeuropathy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, erectile dysfunction, and recurrent localized herpes simplex virus infection. He was left-handed. His daily medications included rosuvastatin, valsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, duloxetine, aspirin, and a multivitamin. He also received, as needed, a topical lidocaine patch for meralgia paresthetica; gabapentin for pain; vardenafil though he had not taken it recently; fluticasone propionate nasal spray and inhaler, albuterol, and loratadine for wheezing and asthma; and vala-cyclovir. He swam regularly, drank wine daily, and did not smoke. His siblings had arthritis and hypercholesterolemia, and his children and grandchildren were healthy. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented. The skin was pale and diaphoretic. The blood pressure was 123/89 mm Hg, and the pulse 58 beats per minute; the other vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. The sensation of light touch was slightly decreased over the malar eminence and the jaw on the left side and was normal over the eyelids, frontalis muscle, and upper neck. There was nystagmus on left lateral gaze, and sustaining left lateral gaze required some effort; the eye movements were slower from midline to the left than from midline to the right. He was able to reproduce the sensation of delayed visual return, which was more severe when moving his head to the right than to the left. When he was not supported, he tilted to the left. He walked cautiously and slowly, with a slightly broad-based gait, and was unable to perform tandem walking. Deep-tendon reflexes were slightly more brisk on the right side than on the left side. The remainder of the neuro-logic and general examinations was normal. The blood level of carbon dioxide was 21.9 mmol per liter reference range, 23.0 to 31.9, the level of glucose was 164 mg per deciliter 9.1 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter 3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter, the level of phosphorus was 1.2 mg per deciliter 0.4 mmol per liter; reference range, 2.6 to 4.5 mg per deciliter 0.8 to 1.5 mmol per liter, and the anion gap was 16 mmol per liter reference range, 3 to 15. Blood levels of other electrolytes, calcium, and magnesium were normal, as were results of the complete blood count and tests of coagulation, renal function, and liver function; screening for troponin I was negative. An electrocardiogram ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 59 beats per minute and no acute ischemic changes. Lo-razepam, ondansetron, and intravenous fluids were administered, and the patients condition partially improved. Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: Approximately 2 hours after the patients arrival, computed tomography CT of the brain, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed normal brain parenchyma and an extraaxial calcified lesion, 9 mm by 16 mm by 6 mm, in the left parafalcine area over the high parietal convexity; there was no intracranial hemorrhage, extraaxial collection, mass effect, or midline shift.

Vestibular Neuritis: Given the acute vestibular symptoms without hearing loss, vestibular neuritis is a consideration, especially with the history of a similar past episode.\n5. Stroke: The presence of lateralized neurological signs, visual disturbances, and inability to tandem walk necessitates consideration of an acute cerebrovascular event.\n6. Meniere’s Disease: The patient's vertigo, although not accompanied by hearing loss or tinnitus, could still be related to Meniere’s given the episodic nature of vestibular symptoms.\n7. Migraine-Associated Vertigo: The mild headache, visual lag, and vertigo could point towards a vestibular migraine, especially with the known history of neurologic symptoms.\n8. Multiple Sclerosis: The combination of focal neurologic deficits and vertigo should include demyelinating diseases like MS in the differential, even though the CT was normal.\n9. Peripheral Neuropathy: The patient’s long-standing meralgia paresthetica might suggest a broader peripheral neuropathic process that could also affect balance.\n10. Hypoglycemia: Despite his elevated glucose levels now, fluctuations in glucose may have resulted in temporary neurologic symptoms including dizziness and weakness."}

The patient was in his usual health, with a history of prostate cancer, until approximately 2 months before admission, when urinary frequency and urgency developed. On digital rectal examination at another hospital, the prostate gland was normal. The blood level of prostate-specific antigen PSA was 0.07 ng per milliliter reference range, 0 to 4.0 ng per milliliter. Urinalysis revealed microscopic hematuria. Five weeks before admission, he saw his primary care provider for routine follow-up; the physical examination was unchanged. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Shortly thereafter, pain in a left lower tooth developed, with numbness of the face and jaw on the lower left side. His dentist prescribed 10 days of amoxicillin, but symptoms persisted. One month before admission, his dentist performed a root canal on a left lower molar, which was completed 10 days before admission. Nine days before admission, the patient returned to his internist; he reported persistent numbness of the lower lip and chin bilaterally, with shooting pain into the area of the left ear. On examination, cranial nerves II through XII were normal; there was slightly decreased sensation to light touch over the chin and lower lip bilaterally. The remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. Eight days before admission, cystoscopy was performed at the other hospital, with resection of an identified bladder tumor. Pathological examination of the tissue reportedly revealed low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, associated with inflammation. After the procedure, the patients family reported that he was depressed, with increasing lethargy, weakness, and anorexia. Two days later, extraction of the left lower molar was performed because of presumed infection. The next day, he was seen in the emergency department of the other hospital because of persistent hematuria, dysuria, and night sweats. He reported abdominal pain, which he rated at 6 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. Vital signs, oxygen saturation, and the physical examination were normal. Test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was positive for occult blood 3, protein 2, and nitrites. A urine culture was sterile. Narcotic analgesia and ciprofloxacin were begun, and he returned home. On the morning of admission, his wife noted increasing confusion, and his family brought him to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient had hypertension, mitral-valve prolapse, and a history of carcinoma of the prostate Gleason score of 6 on a scale of 1 to 10, with higher scores indicating a worse prognosis that had been treated with brachytherapy 10 years earlier; PSA levels remained normal after therapy. He had had nephrolithiasis decades earlier and a hip replacement. Medications included ciprofloxacin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, phenazopyridine, dutasteride, tamsulosin, and aspirin 81 mg daily. He had no known allergies. He was married, lived with his wife, and worked in an office. He exercised daily and did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His father had died of lung cancer at 59 years of age, and his mother at 89 years of age from natural causes; a brother had prostate cancer and alcoholism. On examination, the patient was somnolent but arousable, and oriented to person and time. The temperature was 36.0C, the blood pressure 140/61 mm Hg, the pulse 93 beats per minute and irregular, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93 while he was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft, without tenderness or distention. There was no peripheral lymphadenopathy and no palpable organomegaly. There was trace edema in both legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, total and direct bilirubin, lipase, amylase, troponin I, and cardiac isoenzymes were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation; other results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was positive for occult blood 2, protein 1, and nitrites. There was no occult blood in the stool. A chest radiograph was normal. An electrocardiogram showed a wandering atrial pacemaker with occasional nonconducted P waves, a ventricular rate of 91 beats per minute, first-degree atrioventricular block, and premature ventricular complexes; the rhythm was new as compared with 2 weeks earlier. In the emergency department, the patients temperature rose to 38.3C. Specimens of blood and urine were cultured. Metronidazole, cefepime, vancomycin, dalteparin, magnesium sulfate, and acetaminophen were administered, as well as intravenous normal saline and oxygen by nasal cannula. He was admitted to this hospital. Ultrasonography of the kidneys revealed left hydronephrosis and a cyst in the left upper pole. On the second day, computed tomography CT of the brain, performed without the administration of contrast material, was unchanged from previous studies. Testing for Clostridium difficile toxin in the stool was negative. Dr. James A. Scott: On the third day, CT scans of the chest and abdomen were obtained after the administration of contrast material. CT images of the chest Fig. 1A and 1B show right axillary lymphadenopathy, a subcarinal mass 5.6 cm in diameter, and superior mediastinal lymphade-nopathy, all showing heterogeneous enhancement. CT images of the abdomen Fig. 1C and 1D show extensive mesenteric, retroperitoneal, periceliac, peripancreatic, periportal, bilateral iliac, and right inguinal lymphadenopathy. Left hydroureteronephrosis is a result of obstruction by left-sided pelvic lymphadenopathy. In the left kidney is an enhancing, exophytic, lobulated mass, 2.5 cm in diameter. There is no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. Dr. Lindsley: The patients mental status improved, and the temperature returned to normal. During the next 6 days, drenching sweats occurred daily. Hypercalcemia resolved, cultures of the blood were sterile, and the administration of antibiotics was stopped. Additional test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urinary symptoms, positive findings for blood, protein, and nitrites on urinalysis, and a history of treated bladder tumor raise the possibility of a concurrent or new UTI, which can also cause confusion in elderly patients.\n\n4. Sepsis: The patient's confusion, fever, recent urinary procedure, and immunocompromised state due to chronic disease and age raise the concern for sepsis, especially with his response to broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\n5. Hypercalcemia of malignancy: Initially present hypercalcemia could be secondary to malignancy, such as metastatic prostate cancer or another malignancy, particularly given his extensive lymphadenopathy which was resolved later.\n\n6. Bladder cancer recurrence: Given his history of low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, there's a possibility of recurrence or progression causing persistent hematuria and other systemic symptoms.\n\n7. Dental infection/osteomyelitis: Persistent facial numbness, jaw pain, and recent dental procedures might suggest a spread of dental infection or osteomyelitis contributing to systemic symptoms.\n\n8. Acute kidney injury (AKI): Left hydronephrosis and frequent urinary symptoms could indicate obstruction and impaired renal function, contributing to altered mental status and systemic illness.\n\n9. Endocarditis: Given his mitral-valve prolapse, persistent infection might suggest subacute bacterial endocarditis, especially with symptoms like night sweats and systemic signs.\n\n10. Medication side effects: Confusion, malaise, and other systemic symptoms could be side effects of multiple medications, such as antibiotics (ciprofloxacin), especially in an elderly patient with polypharmacy."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Joanna Lopez Medicine: A 38-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of anemia and thrombocytopenia. The patient had been well until approximately 3 months before admission, when fatigue, malaise, and light-headedness developed that she attributed to a viral illness. Three weeks before admission, fatigue worsened, and dyspnea on exertion, bruising on the legs, dark urine, and headache developed. She reported that she felt like staying in a bed all day and needed assistance with showering. Two days before admission, she went to another hospital. The physical examination was reportedly normal, as were the results of coagulation tests. Screening for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus HIV and a rapid plasma reagin test were negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. She was admitted to the other hospital. Examination of the peripheral-blood smear reportedly revealed normal morphologic features of the white cells, a reduced platelet count, spherocytes, and polychromatic red cells. A direct antiglobulin test Coombs test was positive, and warm-reacting and cold-reacting autoantibodies were reportedly present. Results of serum and urinary protein electrophoresis were normal. Glucocorticoids methyl-prednisolone at a dose of 150 mg twice daily for 2 days, followed by prednisone at a dose of 70 mg twice daily were administered, as were ondansetron and folate, but the patients condition did not improve Table 1. Computed tomographic CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained after the intravenous administration of contrast material, were normal. On the second night, hypotension developed but improved after the intravenous administration of fluids. On the third day, the hematocrit was 16.8. One unit of packed red cells was transfused, and pantopra-zole was administered. The patient was transferred to this hospital because of difficulty finding additional red-cell units that were compatible with her antibody screen. On admission, the patient reported a weight loss of 2.3 kg during the previous week, intermittent blurred or double vision in both eyes, and for the previous 3 months, transient vesicular lesions on the thighs that resolved spontaneously within 2 or 3 days. She did not have hematuria, dysuria, chest pain, abdominal pain, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, arthralgias, myalgias, melena, or hematochezia. Approximately 3 years earlier, she had had a similar illness, with dyspnea, light-headedness, and an unintentional weight loss of 18 kg, which had gradually resolved spontaneously. She had a history of depression, anemia a hematocrit 6 years before admission was reportedly normal, and during childhood and pregnancy, epistaxis; she had had a hysterectomy at 22 years of age because of metrorrhagia after a cesarean section. Medications at home included bupropion, a multivitamin, and occasionally flax-seeds. She had no known allergies. She was born in South America, moved to the United States more than 10 years earlier, and worked with children. She had recently traveled to Central America and the Caribbean. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her father had hyperthyroidism, and her mother had diabetes mellitus; her siblings and child were healthy. On examination, the patients blood pressure was 105/55 mm Hg, and the other vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. She had mild conjunctival icterus and a single vesicular lesion 1 cm in diameter with an erythematous base on the posterior right thigh. The remainder of the examination was normal. The red-cell indexes mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were normal, as were the pro-thrombin time, the prothrombin-time international normalized ratio, results of renal-function tests, and blood levels of electrolytes, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, C-reactive protein, lipase, amylase, folate, and vitamin B12. Testing for partial-thromboplastin time to detect a lupus anticoagulant was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Examination of the peripheral-blood smear revealed macrocytes, poly-chromatocytes, microspherocytes, very few meta-myelocytes, predominantly normal platelets, and no schistocytes or malignant cells. Urinalysis revealed 3 urobilinogen and was otherwise normal. The blood type was O, Rh-positive; an antibody screen indirect antiglobulin test and a direct antiglobulin test were positive. The administration of prednisone, folate, and bupro-pion were continued. A swab of the lesion on the right thigh was sent for culture. Transfusion of 1 unit of leukoreduced red cells was begun, but pain and burning developed immediately at the site of the infusion. Another attempt was made, on the contralateral side; however, after the infusion of a few milliliters, pain, burning, and facial flushing occurred, and the systolic blood pressure fell from 94 to 84 mm Hg within 15 minutes. The transfusion was stopped, and the symptoms resolved. The culture of the lesion on the right thigh revealed herpes simplex virus type 2 HSV-2, a urine culture grew more than 100,000 mixed flora, and blood cultures were sterile. Additional test results are shown in Table 1. Diagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Mathias Lichterfeld Medicine: A 41-year-old woman with a history of human immunodeficiency virus HIV infection was admitted to the hospital because of malaise and chest and abdominal pain. The patient had been well until approximately 2 weeks before presentation, when fatigue and malaise gradually developed. One week before presentation, she was seen in the outpatient clinic at this hospital for routine HIV follow-up. She reported having had unprotected intercourse with a new HIV-positive male partner 1 month earlier and was concerned about sexually transmitted diseases. Physical examination was normal. A complete blood count, measurement of electrolyte levels including calcium, and results of renal-function tests were normal; nucleic acid testing of a urine specimen was negative for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; other laboratory results are shown in Table 1. Immunizations for hepatitis A and B, influenza, pneumococcus, and combined tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis were administered. During the next week, an erythematous, nonpruritic, nonpainful rash developed over the patients chest and abdomen and then resolved spontaneously within hours. She reported episodes of epigastric and periumbilical abdominal pain, more severe at night, that awakened her from sleep; she had occasional brief, sharp abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant. Nausea occurred intermittently after eating, without alteration in the pain. Approximately 2 days before admission, episodes of right-sided chest pain developed, which increased with hiccups and deep inspiration and lasted up to 12 minutes. On the morning of admission, she awoke with right-sided chest pain that radiated to her left arm. The pain was associated with transient diaphoresis, nausea, and shortness of breath. She came to this hospital for evaluation. The patient reported unintentional weight loss of approximately 5 kg during the previous 2 months and mild constipation during the previous 2 weeks. Eight years before admission, a diagnosis of HIV type 1 HIV-1 infection was made during an evaluation of wasting, thrush, hair loss, and malaise; she has been receiving treatment with antiretroviral medications since then. Four months before admission, she transferred her care to this hospital, and baseline test results were obtained Table 1. She also had dyslipidemia, obesity, anxiety, depression, recurrent sinusitis, alcohol and opiate dependence, candidal vaginitis, chronic neuropathy in a glove-and-stocking distribution, gastroesophageal reflux disease, a history of herpes simplex virus type 2 HSV-2 and chlamydia infections, and a remote history of surgical procedures for a femur fracture and endometriosis. Medications included methadone, ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, a tenofoviremtricitabine combination, valacyclovir, trazodone, quetiapine, and bupropion. She was allergic to sulfa drugs and levofloxacin. She was a student and lived in a drug-free group home. She smoked cigarettes. She reported no ingestion of raw food, exposure to sick contacts or animals, or recent travel. On examination, the patient was obese; the vi-tal signs and examination were otherwise normal. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm at a rate of 61 beats per minute, with anterior ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities similar to those seen on a previous tracing. A complete blood count and a white-cell differential count were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, iron, iron-binding capacity, creatine kinase isoenzymes, troponin I, and troponin T; testing for antinuclear and antimitochondrial antibodies was negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Toxicologic screening of the blood and the urine was negative. Results of ultrasonography of the abdomen showed a dilated common bile duct but were otherwise normal, without evidence of intra-hepatic biliary-duct dilatation or sonographic Murphys sign localized tenderness over the gallbladder. Urinary human chorionic gonadotropin testing was negative. Urinalysis revealed orange, cloudy fluid with 1 bilirubin, 1 albumin, 2 urobilinogen, and 3 to 5 red cells and 0 to 2 white cells per high-power field, with mucin, few squamous cells, and bacteria present. Diagnostic procedures were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Acute hepatitis C virus infection. ", "prediction": "1.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Jennifer M. Rosenbluth Medicine: A 30-year-old man was seen in an outpatient clinic at this hospital because of fever and lymphadenopathy. The patient had been well until approximately 2 weeks before presentation, when an enlarging, tender lump developed at the posterior base of the neck on the right side. Two days before presentation, fever to a temperature of 39.4C, a mild headache, myalgias, chills, and fatigue developed. He took ibuprofen, but his condition did not improve, and he came to this hospital for evaluation. The patient reported no history of sore throat, coryza, or earache. He had had a low hemoglobin level in the past but was otherwise healthy. He reportedly had had a negative tuberculin skin test in the past, and he had not received an influenza vaccine during the previous year. He took no other medications and had no known allergies. He was born in India and came to the United States 4 years previously to attend school; his most recent visit to India was 6 months before presentation. He worked in an office and lived with a roommate. He was not sexually active and had no known exposures to sick contacts, animals, or blood products. He had stopped smoking 2 years before this presentation, drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. His parents had diabetes mellitus; there was no family history of autoimmune or connective-tissue diseases. On examination, the temperature was 38.9C, the blood pressure 129/80 mm Hg, and the pulse 104 beats per minute. A group of five tender lymph nodes, each approximately 1 cm in diameter, was present in the posteroinferior cervical chain on the right side; the lymph nodes in the posterior cervical chain on the left side and in both inguinal regions were nontender, and there were no abnormal lymph nodes in the supraclavicular or axillary regions. A systolic ejection murmur grade 1 out of 6 was heard at the cardiac base; the remainder of the examination was normal. During evaluation, the temperature rose to 39.5C and was associated with chills. Blood levels of glucose, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were results of tests of liver and renal function; testing for heterophile antibodies and rapid tests for streptococcal pharyngitis and influenza virus were negative. Additional test results are shown in Table 1. A blood culture was sterile. The administration of acetaminophen alternating with ibuprofen was recommended, as were fluids and rest. The patient returned home but was advised to return to the outpatient clinic if his condition did not improve. Two days later, the patient returned to the clinic. He reported decreased appetite, chills, sweats related to fevers, mild headaches and body aches, and a new nonproductive cough. On examination, the lymph nodes on the right side were slightly larger than on the previous examination and were slightly confluent; the lymph nodes on the left side and a submental lymph node were soft and mobile. Bronchial breath sounds were heard over the right side of the chest anteriorly, and the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Hemoglobin electrophoresis and DNA sequence analysis revealed hemoglobin D Punjab, an abnormal variant of the -globin chain of hemoglobin, at a level of 91.8, as well as a hemoglobin A level of 0 reference range, 95.8 to 98.0, a hemoglobin A2 level of 7.0 reference range, 2.0 to 3.3, and a hemoglobin F level of 1.2 reference range, 0.0 to 0.9; other test results are shown in Table 1. The patient declined testing for the human immunodeficiency virus HIV. Dr. Daniel F. Boyer: A fine-needle aspiration biopsy of an enlarged cervical lymph node was performed, and the aspirate showed a mixed population of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and occasional plasma cells. Some of the histiocytes contained cellular debris and angular, crescentic nuclei. The polymorphous composition of the aspirate and the mature appearance of the lymphocytes were suggestive of a reactive process Fig. 1. Grams and acid-fast staining of the aspirate revealed no organisms. Flow cytometry of the aspirate showed no immunophenotypic abnormalities. Dr. Rosenbluth: A blood culture and a culture of the aspirate were sterile. A chest radiograph was normal. The patient returned home again, with instructions to return to the clinic if fevers persisted. Two days later, the patient reported persistent fevers and a dull headache and was admitted to the hospital. He reported no night sweats, weight loss, rhinorrhea, neck rigidity, neck pain, vision changes, weakness, or numbness and no respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary symptoms. On examination, the blood pressure was 106/58 mm Hg, and the pulse 104 beats per minute; the respirations were 20 breaths per minute, with an oxygen saturation of 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air. There was a superficial ulcer on the right side of the lower lip, and the spleen tip was palpable approximately 3 cm below the costal margin; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Blood levels of lactic acid, C3, C4, haptoglobin, creatine kinase, and thyrotropin were normal; testing for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies was negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed yellow, clear fluid, with 1 occult blood, trace albumin, and few squamous cells per high-power field, and was otherwise normal. Fluids were administered intravenously, and another blood sample was obtained for culture. The maximal daily temperature was 40.7C on the first day. On the second day, the temperature rose to 40.8C. Dr. Victorine V. Muse: Computed tomographic CT scans of the neck and chest obtained after the administration of contrast material Fig. 2 showed lymph nodes measuring up to 9 mm in diameter in the submental, submandibular, and jugular chains and at the posterior cervical level; mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, the largest, at the subcarinal level, measuring 9 mm in diameter; bilateral, clustered axillary lymph nodes measuring up to 10 mm in diameter; a small, anterior peri-cardial effusion; a soft-tissue nodule, 4 mm in diameter, in the left lower lobe; mild centrilobular emphysema, predominantly in the upper lobe; and occasional subcentimeter cystic lucencies, predominantly in the paramediastinal lingula and right upper lobe. CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis obtained after the administration of contrast material showed spleno megaly, measuring 16.5 cm in the maximal craniocaudal dimension normal range, 14 cm; a cystic structure, 3.5 cm by 2.6 cm, in the interpolar region of the right kidney; and no evidence of lymphadenopathy in the abdomen or pelvis. Dr. Rosenbluth: Additional test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures remained sterile. Fevers recurred daily. A tuberculin skin test was negative after 48 hours.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Amir Aboutalebi Dermatology: A 57-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent painful bullous and erosive skin lesions. Approximately 19 months before admission, 1 week after the patient had begun taking citalopram, the development of oral erosions, tongue swelling, and urti-carial lesions, approximately 1 cm in diameter, on her torso occurred. These symptoms were followed during the next several weeks by joint pain and swelling in her hands, fatigue, and low-grade fevers. Citalopram was stopped, and antihistamines were prescribed, which the patient reported that she did not take for religious reasons; during the next month, the lesions worsened. She was admitted to this hospital. The patient reported difficulty eating because of oral ulcers; she also reported pain on urination and defecation because of vaginal and anal lesions. She had a history of obesity, hypertension, and depression. Nine months before that admission 27 months before the current admission, she had an episode of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia associated with a tubo-ovarian abscess and complicated by bacterial endocarditis, infectious endophthalmitis causing near-total blindness, and a myocardial infarction due to a septic embolus from valvular vegetation. Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed at that time. Medications included furosemide, metoprolol tartrate, aspirin 81 mg daily, diphenhydramine as needed for itching, and a multivitamin. She was divorced and lived alone; she did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. For religious reasons, she was reluctant to take medications and was distrustful of the medical system. She was of African-American descent and had one adult child; her father had died in an accident, her mother had hypertension, and an aunt had breast cancer. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable because of oral lesions. The temperature was 38.7C. There were erosions on the inner lips and buccal mucosa, and there was edema of the lips. There were erythematous plaques with dusky centers on the abdomen; coalescent, erythematous, mildly scaly symmetric plaques on the back; and small oval erosions in the perianal area and vagina. The wrist, metacarpal, and proximal interphalangeal joints were tender, without swell-ing or erythema. Pathological examination of a cutaneous-biopsy specimen revealed interface dermatitis a finding consistent with erythema multiforme and a mild increase in dermal mucin deposition. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and acyclovir were administered; acyclovir was stopped when cultures for herpes simplex virus were negative. Screening for cold agglutinins was negative. When the course of antibiotics was completed, prednisone 40 mg daily and hydroxychloroquine were prescribed, but she refused the medication. She was discharged on the 12th day. Discharge medications included prednisone 40 mg daily, hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily, di-phenhydramine as needed, fluocinolone ointment 0.025, and betamethasone dipropionate ointment 0.05. Eighteen days later 17 months before this admission, the patient was readmitted because of a persistent and increasingly painful erosive, pruritic rash on her back; the oral and anogeni-tal lesions had resolved. She reported not taking prednisone or hydroxychloroquine. Examination revealed erythematous scaly plaques with central erosions on the back, chest, thighs, and buttocks. Laboratory results are shown in Table 1. A second skin-biopsy specimen showed findings consistent with bullous lupus erythematosus. Hydroxy-chloroquine and prednisone were prescribed, but the patient declined the medications. She was discharged on the seventh day. Six weeks later, the patient was admitted to Brigham and Womens Hospital BWH because of worsening blistering and erosive skin lesions during the past week. The temperature was 39.4C. Erythroderma of the face and torso was present Fig. 1A and 1B; there were erosions and large flakes of desquamation and scattered, fragile flaccid bullae and open blisters covering approximately 70 of the body-surface area, predominantly on the upper chest and breasts, with only a few plaques on the lower body and legs, and no lesions on the palms, soles, oral mucosa, or genitalia. Pathological examination of a third skin-biopsy specimen reportedly showed findings consistent with pemphigus foliaceus. Methylprednisolone 125 mg daily was administered intravenously for 3 days, followed by a tapering course of prednisone 60 mg daily for 3 days, then 50 mg daily and topical clobeta-sol, with rapid improvement in the skin lesions. The patient was discharged on the eighth day first to a rehabilitation hospital, then home, and she indicated that she would adhere to hy-droxychloroquine and prednisone therapy. The administration of hydroxychloroquine was begun, and prednisone was tapered. At a follow-up examination at BWH 10 days after discharge, there were no active skin lesions. After 3 months, the patient stopped keeping follow-up appointments with the dermatology service at BWH and declined follow-up with rheumatology. Seven months before admission, at a follow-up appointment with her internist at this hospital, she reported taking hydroxychlo-roquine 200 mg twice daily, prednisone 5 mg daily, furosemide, metoprolol, aspirin, diphen-hydramine, and topical glucocorticoid ointments, and she had no active skin lesions. Sometime thereafter, she stopped taking hydroxychloro-quine and prednisone. Eight days before this admission, the patient returned to her internist because of recurrent skin lesions and alopecia. There were tender, pruritic skin lesions on her scalp that were ulcerated and excoriated and in the periumbilical area. She declined admission but resumed using hy-droxychloroquine and topical betamethasone valerate lotion 0.1; the administration of vitamin A and D ointment was added. She declined oral prednisone therapy because of concern about diabetes mellitus and weight gain. On the day of admission, the patient was brought to the emergency department at this hospital because of worsening skin lesions and increasing pain rated at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. On examination, the vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. There were multiple flaccid bullous lesions and superficial erosions, with crusting and mild oozing on the chest, back, abdomen, and both arms and shoulders Fig. 1C and 1D. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, total and direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation and renal function; other results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was normal. Oxycodone 5 mg was administered, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. A diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Pemphigus erythematosus. ", "prediction": "1. Bullous Pemphigoid: Given the presentation of recurrent painful flaccid bullous lesions and erosions, bullous pemphigoid is a likely autoimmune blistering disorder in this older patient.\n2. Pemphigus Foliaceus: The patient's history of biopsy-confirmed pemphigus foliaceus, characterized by fragile blisters and superficial erosions, supports this diagnosis.\n3. Bullous Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: The biopsy showing findings consistent with bullous lupus erythematosus, along with systemic symptoms such as joint pain and low-grade fevers, suggests this potentiality.\n4. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis: The widespread skin and mucosal symptoms, including erosions and involvement of multiple body surfaces, are hallmark features.\n5. Drug-induced Bullous Dermatosis: The temporal relationship between starting citalopram and the onset of symptoms raises the suspicion of drug-induced bullous dermatosis.\n6. Erythema Multiforme: This is supported by the presence of target lesions (dusky centers), interface dermatitis on biopsy, and associated systemic symptoms like fever.\n7. Dermatitis Herpetiformis: Despite the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, the pruritic, bullous nature of the lesions is consistent with dermatitis herpetiformis, especially considering the absence of other clear diagnoses.\n8. Secondary Syphilis: The disseminated rash, including mucosal involvement, should warrant testing for secondary syphilis, which can present with similar skin findings.\n9. Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis: This condition can present with multiple skin erosions and systemic symptoms such as fever and pain, needing further confirmation through histopathological examination.\n10. Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type II: Given the history of multiple endocrine-related concerns and skin manifestations, this rare syndrome should be considered."}

Heath Medicine: A 32-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of loss of vision. The patient was in his usual health until 3 weeks before admission, when painless conjunctival injection developed in the left eye, associated with dryness. He self-administered ophthalmic tetrahydrozoline solution, and the condition resolved. Approximately 1 week before admission, the symptoms recurred and progressively worsened. Discharge with crusting was present in both eyes in the mornings. Three days before admission, he noted loss of vision on awakening, with light perception in the left eye and blurred vision in the right eye; vision in the right eye reportedly improved slightly after the administration of ophthalmic tetrahydrozoline solution. Discharge from the eyes and crusting on the eyelashes persisted. On the morning of admission, a relative visited the patient at his home and took him to the emergency department at another hospital. On examination, the vital signs were normal. Ophthalmic abnormalities were reportedly noted. Laboratory results are shown in Table 1. A metal eye protector was placed over the left eye and normal saline was administered intravenously. He was transferred by ambulance to this hospital, for coordination of ophthalmic care with Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, which is affiliated with this hospital. The patient reported that he had no ocular pain, pruritus, or grittiness and therefore had not sought evaluation earlier; reportedly it had been 1 week since he had looked in the mirror. He reported a 1-week history of pain in the right hip joint with radiation to the knee, a 3-week history of an acneiform rash on his face, and a 4-week history of rash on his lower legs. He reported no fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, oral ulcers, direct eye inoculation, or injury. He had hypertension and a history of alcohol and illicit inhalational drug use. He took no other medications and had no known allergies. He smoked cigarettes until the onset of this illness, when he also stopped alcohol intake; he reported no illicit drug use for 3 months. He lived alone and was unemployed. He reported that his father had spine fusion disease and that an aunt had had transient blindness. On examination, the patient appeared older than his stated age. He was alert, oriented, pale, and thin, with temporal wasting. The vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. The height was 181 cm, the weight 63.5 kg, and the body-mass index BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 19.4. Ophthalmologic examination revealed con-junctival injection in both eyes 2 ciliary flush on the right, and diffuse 3 injection on the left, with purulent crusting and discharge on the lashes, which was worse on the left eye Fig. 1. Punctate epithelial erosions also known as superficial punctate keratitis were seen diffusely on the right cornea worse inferiorly. On the nasal side of the left cornea, there was a perforated descemetocele corneal thinning down to the innermost layer of Descemets membrane measuring 8 mm by 6 mm with exposure of the uvea, as well as a suppurative corneal ulcer adjacent to the perforation temporally that measured 9 mm by 2 mm; the temporal edge of the cornea appeared hazy and edematous, without thinning. Visual acuity measured 20200 on the right tested with a visual acuity card held at a specific distance from the patients face and was graded as light perception on the left the patient could not detect hand motion but could tell when a flashlight was turned on or off. The right pupil was 3 mm in diameter, reactive to 2 mm, with no relative afferent pupillary defect; the left pupil was obscured by purulence. Extraocular movements were full. The intraocular pressure in the right eye was 13 mm Hg. On general physical examination, there were petechiae on the soft palate; follicular horny pap-ules, perifollicular erythema, corkscrew hairs, and nonscarring alopecia on the arms; and perifol-licular and nonfollicular purpuric macules and papules on the legs. A mental-status examination revealed lack of insight and a flat affect. The remainder of the examination was normal. The platelet count, red-cell indexes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, phosphorus, globulin, alanine and aspar-tate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and angiotensin-converting enzyme; toxicologic screening was negative. Other laboratory results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Dr. Javier M. Romero: Computed tomography CT of the head performed with the administration of contrast material revealed multiple sub-centimeter rim-enhancing lesions, predominantly in the submental subcutaneous tissue Fig. 2A; there was substantial fat stranding surrounding these lesions, a feature that most likely represented multiple fluid collections and raised suspicion for microabscesses. There was swelling and fat stranding in the medial canthus of the left globe. There was also left preseptal soft-tissue swelling associated with scleral thickening Fig. 2B. These findings were compatible with periorbital cellulitis and scleritis. CT of the brain without the administration of contrast material revealed mild soft-tissue swelling and fat stranding overlying the left eye. There was no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial acute infarction, or intracranial mass lesion. Dr. Heath: Vancomycin, cefepime, magnesium sulfate, potassium chloride, and normal saline were administered intravenously, and folate, thiamine, and a multivitamin were given orally. On the second day, testing for rheumatoid factor and antibodies to double-stranded DNA, Ro, La, Sm, RNP, and treponema syphilis was negative, as was testing for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies and antigen. Other test results are shown in Table 1. A procedure and diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Severe vitamin A, C, and D deficiencies. ", "prediction": "1. **Bacterial Keratitis**: The presence of conjunctival injection, discharge, and punctate epithelial erosions, combined with the history of corneal perforation and ulceration, strongly suggests a serious bacterial infection of the cornea.\n2. **Periorbital Cellulitis**: CT findings of left preseptal swelling and scleral thickening, along with clinical signs of infection, indicate a possible periorbital cellulitis.\n3. **Scleritis**: The CT finding of left scleral thickening aligns with the clinical presentation of conjunctival injection and severe ocular symptoms, supporting a diagnosis of scleritis.\n4. **Endophthalmitis**: The severe vision loss and purulent discharge could indicate a serious intraocular infection such as endophthalmitis.\n5. **Vitamin A Deficiency**: The skin changes (follicular papules, perifollicular erythema, and corkscrew hairs) and ocular symptoms (xerophthalmia and keratitis) suggest possible vitamin A deficiency.\n6. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome**: The presence of a scarring skin rash and severe ocular involvement could indicate a severe mucocutaneous reaction like Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\n7. **Autoimmune Uveitis**: Although the tests for autoimmune markers were negative, the constellation of symptoms could be indicative of an underlying autoimmune condition causing uveitis.\n8. **Acanthamoeba Keratitis**: The prolongation and severity of the corneal symptoms, especially following water exposure, raise the suspicion of this rare parasitic infection.\n9. **Fungal Keratitis**: The chronicity and severity of the symptoms, especially in the presence of underlying eye trauma or immunosuppression, could suggest a fungal etiology.\n10. **Syphilitic Uveitis**: Despite the negative treponemal test, the systemic symptoms along with severe ocular involvement necessitate consideration of syphilitic uveitis."}

Shea Medicine: A 61-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of epigastric pain, vomiting, diarrhea, anemia, and acute kidney injury. The patient had been well until approximately 3 weeks before admission, when vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, arthralgias, and episodes of epigastric pain of increasing frequency and severity developed, which she attributed to a viral gastroenteritis. Two weeks before admission, epigastric and midabdominal pain worsened, with diarrhea and one episode of vomiting. The next day, she came to the emergency department at this hospital. She rated the pain at 4 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain and reported that it was worse when she was lying flat. The blood pressure was 150/82 mm Hg, and the pulse 101 beats per minute; other vital signs were normal. The abdomen was soft, and there was mild epigastric tenderness without rebound; the remainder of the examination was normal. A stool specimen revealed occult blood. The red-cell indexes, platelet count, and blood levels of total and direct bilirubin were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram was normal. The patient returned home taking ranitidine, simethicone, and antacids. Three days later, upper endoscopic examination revealed a small hiatus hernia and was otherwise normal. Results of Helicobacter pylori antibody testing were reported as representing either infection or immunity; the blood level of haptoglobin was normal. Other test results are shown in Table 1. The next day, she was admitted to this hospital. The patient reported no history of melena or hematochezia. She had labile hypertension for which triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide in combination and metoprolol had been prescribed at different times and discontinued because of hypotension and gastrointestinal symptoms, respectively, hypercholesterolemia with normal lipid profile 2 months earlier, allergic rhinitis, and possible gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and she had had a urinary tract infection in the past. Imaging studies in the past had revealed ovarian cysts and bilateral pulmonary nodules, suggestive of old granulomatous disease. Medications included ranitidine, atorvastatin, and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. She had no history of allergies to medications. She was married, retired, and physically active. She drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. She had done no recent foreign traveling; her husband and friends had recently had transient gastroenteritis. The patients father had died at 72 years of age from esophageal cancer, a grandfather and a paternal aunt had had lymphoma, and maternal cousins had sarcoma and lung cancer; her mother and children were healthy, and there was no family history of renal or rheumatologic diseases. On examination, the blood pressure was 160/77 mm Hg, the pulse 89 beats per minute, and the temperature 37.7C; the respirations and the remainder of the examination were normal. Blood levels of haptoglobin, glucose, folic acid, vitamin B12, ferritin, phosphorus, magnesium, amylase, and lipase were normal, as were the results of coagulation tests; serum protein electrophoresis revealed a normal pattern, and im-munofixation showed no M component. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Review of the peripheral-blood smear revealed occasional reactive-appearing atypical lymphocytes. On the second day, a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration were performed. Pathological examination of the specimen revealed trilineage hemato-poiesis with normal morphologic features; a karyo-type was normal. A small, clonal B-cell population 3 of B cells expressing CD19 CD20 CD5 CD10 kappa was detected with the use of flow cytometry; immunohistochemical staining revealed scattered T cells, occasional B cells, and occasional polyclonal plasma cells. Serologic testing for celiac disease was negative, as was examination of the stool for H. pylori antigen, leukocytes, rotavirus, enteric pathogens, ova, and parasites. On the third day, the hematocrit fell to 24.5. The ABO blood type was O, Rh positive, with negative antibody screening and a negative direct antiglobulin test, and 2 units of red cells irradiated and leukocyte-reduced were transfused; the hematocrit rose to 30.4. The patient was discharged from the hospital. Two days after discharge, diarrhea developed, and 3 days later, anorexia, nausea, epigastric pain constant, rated at 7 out of 10, and recurrent bilious and occasionally blood-streaked emesis occurred. The patient took bismuth subsalicylate, but her condition did not improve. The next day, she returned to the emergency department. She reported fevers a temperature of 38.1C, with chills and diaphoresis. On examination, the blood pressure was 179/92 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, and the temperature 37.0C, with normal respi-rations and oxygen saturation. The abdomen was soft, with mild epigastric tenderness, without rebound or masses; the remainder of the examination was normal. The stool was black and positive for occult blood trace. Test results are shown in Table 1. Ondansetron and intravenous fluids were administered. Within 3.5 hours, the systolic blood pressure rose to 200 mm Hg, and the pulse to 94 beats per minute. The temperature later rose to 38.1C. Oxygen supplementation, ondansetron, antacids, oxycodone, acetaminophen, and irbesartan were administered. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed trace asci-tes and small pleural effusions. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Results of testing for antinuclear antibodies ANA and antibodies to double-stranded DNA were negative. The next day, renal vascular ultra-sonography revealed no evidence of renal-artery stenosis. Methylprednisolone 1 g daily, intravenously and labetalol were administered. Cyto-logic examination of the urine showed red-cell casts, hyaline casts, oxalate crystals, and no malignant cells. Culture of the urine grew few colonies 1000 to 10,000 of mixed bacteria. On the fifth day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

Strom Medicine: A 39-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of night sweats and abdominal pain. The patient had been well until 1 week before admission, when night sweats developed, which he attributed to the summer heat. Three days before admission, episodes of sharp abdominal pain developed; the pain was greatest at the costal margin on the right side, and the patient rated it at up to 7 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The pain lasted up to 2.5 hours, increased with deep breaths, was worse 1 to 2 hours after meals, and was associated with mild nausea, belching, hiccups, bloating, and loose, gray stools. The symptoms did not improve with simethicone or ibuprofen. On the day of admission, the pain recurred with increased severity, and the patient came to the emergency department at this hospital. Two weeks before admission, the patient had had a sharp frontal headache for several days after having traveled to a coastal region in the northeastern United States. He had had psoriasis since 10 years of age and, during the previous year, a few episodes of vertigo with ear fullness, for which he took meclizine, with improvement. A diagnosis of erythema nodosum had been made 3 years before admission, when he presented with raised, painful nodules on the shins and ankle pain; 1 month later, he had an episode of pain and erythema in the right knee a synovial-fluid aspirate reportedly showed low cell counts and negative cultures. He also had had cellulitis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, an appendectomy, a herniorrhaphy, and a turbinectomy. He reported no fevers, chills, chest pain, dyspnea, vomiting, melena, hematochezia, new rashes, or bruises. His only medication was topical clobetasol. He was allergic to trimethoprimsulfa-methoxazole and hydrocodone. He drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. He was married and worked in a medical facility. His mother had diverticulitis, and his father had hypertension. His siblings were healthy; he had no children. On examination, the vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. The abdomen was soft, without distention and with tenderness in the right upper quadrant. The spleen tip was palpable. There were matted, firm lymph nodes in the inguinal region and hyperpigmented, scaly plaques on the lower legs and waist; the remainder of the examination was normal. The white-cell count was 5800 per cubic millimeter reference range, 4500 to 11,000, with 73 neutrophils reference range, 40 to 70, 14 lymphocytes reference range, 22 to 44, 6 monocytes reference range, 4 to 11, and 7 eosinophils reference range, 0 to 8; the blood level of C-reactive protein was 9.7 mg per liter reference range, 8.0, negative for inflammation, and the blood level of angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE was 55 U per liter reference range, 8 to 53. The remainder of the complete blood count, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a urinalysis were normal, as were results of coagulation and renal- and liver-function tests and blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, amylase, and lipase. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, hepatitis C virus antibodies, and hepatitis B virus surface antigen was negative; testing for hepatitis B virus surface antibodies was positive. An electrocardiogram ECG showed normal sinus rhythm, with a borderline early-repolarization abnormality and T-wave inversions in leads V1 and V2. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed multiple rounded, hy-poechoic areas in the spleen, which was not enlarged, with no evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Dr. Victorine V. Muse: Computed tomographic CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained after the administration of contrast material, showed numerous ill-defined, hypoattenuating lesions, 1 to 2 cm in diameter, in the spleen Fig. 1, as well as bilateral, dependent atelectasis in the lungs. A hypoattenuating lesion in the liver, measuring less than 1 cm in diameter, was slightly increased in size from a study 8 years earlier and was thought to represent a cyst; small, nonspecific retroperitoneal and mesen-teric lymph nodes were also seen. A chest radio-graph showed an ill-defined opacity in the left apex, overlying the end of the first rib, and a rounded opacity in the left hilar region. An ultrasound examination of the legs revealed benign-appearing enlarged inguinal lymph nodes, the largest of which was 1.5 cm by 0.6 cm. Dr. Strom: The patients abdominal pain improved, and he was discharged on the second hospital day. Dr. Muse: At a follow-up visit 2 days after discharge, a CT scan of the chest, obtained after the administration of contrast material, showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy, with lymph nodes as large as 1.8 cm in diameter. The CT scan also showed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, an enlarged anterior diaphragmatic lymph node 1.2 cm in diameter, clustered nodular opacities within the lung in a perilymphatic distribution Fig. 2, multiple splenic lesions, a hypervascular lesion in the posterior right lobe of the liver, and a hypodense lesion 0.6 cm in diameter in the left lobe of the liver, which was thought to represent a hepatic cyst.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Jacob H. Johnson Medicine: A 59-year-old-man was admitted to this hospital because of fever, confusion, thrombocytopenia, rash, and renal failure. The patient had been well until 3 days before admission, when vomiting, dia-phoresis, and increasing fatigue developed while he was traveling. The next day, the patient reportedly felt feverish and took ibuprofen and over-the-counter medications for influenza-like symptoms. During the afternoon and evening before admission, his family was unable to contact him by telephone. That night, his wife contacted emergency personnel, who went to the hotel where he was staying. They found him seated in his room, where he was nonverbal, unable to stand, but able to respond to painful stimuli. The blood pressure was 132/82 mm Hg, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94 while he was breathing supplemental oxygen at 2 liters per minute by nasal cannula. The pupils were 3 mm and nonreactive. The skin was warm. A capillary glucose level was 148 mg per deciliter 8.2 mmol per liter. An electrocardiogram ECG revealed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 132 beats per minute. Naloxone was administered nasally, but the patients condition did not improve. He was transported to another hospital. On examination at the other hospital, the temperature was 40.1C, the blood pressure 103/71 mm Hg, the pulse 130 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 36 breaths per minute while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared withdrawn and confused and thought he was in his home state of Nevada. The Glasgow Coma Scale score was 14 on a scale of 3 indicating coma to 15 indicating normal. Speech was slow. He obeyed commands. Toxicologic screening was negative. Reportedly, the hematocrit and white-cell count were normal, the platelet count was decreased, and the percentage of band forms was elevated; blood levels of sodium, potassium, chloride, and glucose were normal, the lactate level was elevated, and the bicarbonate level was decreased. Results of tests of renal and liver function were elevated. Testing for occult blood in the stool was positive. A chest radiograph was normal; computed tomographic images of the brain, abdomen, and pelvis, obtained without the administration of contrast material, reportedly showed no acute abnormality. A presumptive diagnosis of meningitis was made. Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, normal saline, and diaze-pam were administered intravenously, and acetaminophen was given rectally. Lumbar puncture was deferred because of thrombocytopenia. An indwelling urinary catheter drained 40 ml of amber, cloudy urine. Cultures of the blood and urine were obtained. The patient was transported to this hospital. On arrival at this hospital, the patient re-ported having little recollection of the previous week. Additional history was obtained from his wife. He reported feeling awful, with diffuse muscle pain, neck stiffness, and pain with swallowing, without headache or rash. He had gout; he took no medications before this illness and had no known allergies. He drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. The patient resided in the Southwest with his wife. He owned two dogs that were healthy and vaccinated. He enjoyed gardening, had gone hunting and walking in brush in Nevada 10 days before admission, and had traveled to Ireland 1 month earlier; on the day before the onset of symptoms, he had arrived in New England for business. He reported no recent dental work and no unusual exposures, such as tick or mosquito bites. On examination, the temperature was 36.1C, the blood pressure 125/81 mm Hg, the pulse 101 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94 while the patient was breathing supplemental oxygen at 2 liters per minute. He was lethargic, diaphoretic, and flushed and was unable to sit up. The first and second heart sounds were normal, without murmurs, rubs, or bruits. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft, without tenderness, distention, or organo-megaly. The skin was mottled, and there was a rash in a livedo pattern on the arms, legs, chest, and abdomen Fig. 1A and a purpuric rash on the hands Fig. 1B. The hands and feet were initially cold, and the muscles were diffusely tender. On neurologic examination, the patient was oriented, but his memory of recent events was impaired. He could follow only one-step commands. Speech was fluent, without paraphasic errors. There was diffuse, generalized weakness. Deep-tendon reflexes were mute in the ankle and otherwise 1 to 2, plantar reflexes were flexor, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Red-cell indexes and blood levels of phosphorus, magnesium, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, lipase, amylase, haptoglobin, and lactic acid were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. No intracellular or extracellular organisms were seen on examination of a peripheral-blood smear. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine; the specific gravity was 1.025, and the pH 5.5, with 1 bilirubin, 2 albumin, and 3 occult blood by dipstick. Examination of the sediment revealed 3 to 5 red cells, 3 to 5 white cells, few bacteria, very few renal tubular cells, and amorphous crystals per high-power field and 20 to 100 granular casts per low-power field. Screening tests for the human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 and antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi were negative. Four hours after his arrival, the patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit. Doxycycline, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin were administered intravenously, and platelets were transfused. Diagnostic procedures were performed, and diagnostic test results were received from the other hospital.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Anna L. Cook Pediatrics: A 35-day-old boy was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit ICU of this hospital because of fever, vomiting, mottled skin, and severe anemia. The patient was born at another hospital, after an uncomplicated 37.5-week gestation, by cesarean section for breech presentation with a fraternal twin. His mother had received prenatal care, and prenatal screening tests for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, group B streptococcus, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis B virus had been negative; screening for immunity to rubella virus was positive. Placental membranes had ruptured less than 24 hours before birth, and antibiotic drugs were administered before delivery. The 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were both 9. The first hepatitis B immunization was administered to the patient before he was discharged. Two days before presentation, at a routine 1-month examination by his pediatrician, he was well, and the second hepatitis B immunization was administered. The day before admission, the patients mother noted increased fussiness, with pale and warm skin; one episode of vomiting occurred. On the morning of admission, tachycardia was noted and vomiting increased. On examination at the pediatricians office, the patient was pale, with mottled skin; the temperature was 38.6C. He was referred immediately to the emergency department of a second hospital. On examination, the weight was 3.61 kg, the rectal temperature 38.0C, the blood pressure 113/63 mm Hg, the pulse 172 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 64 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while he was breathing ambient air. He was pale, listless, and fussy, with mild suprasternal and intercostal retractions, without grunting or nasal flaring. The remainder of the examination was normal. A lumbar puncture was performed. Samples of the blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid were obtained for culture. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed dark red, cloudy urine, with a pH of 7.0, a specific gravity of 1.015, a large amount of blood, 100 mg per deciliter of protein, and trace leukocyte esterase by dipstick, as well as 0 to 5 red cells and white cells per high-power field and a small amount of bacteria, a moderate number of epithelial cells, and 15 to 20 granular casts per low-power field. Ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and a bolus of normal saline were administered intravenously, and a transfusion of leukocyte-depleted, packed red cells type O, Rh-negative was begun. Less than 4 hours after presentation, the patient was transferred to this hospital; en route, clindamycin, crystalloid solution, and the remainder of the red-cell transfusion were administered intravenously, and oxygen was given through a nasal cannula. The patient had previously been well, consuming both breast milk and formula. He lived with his parents, his twin, and an older sibling in a suburban, forested neighborhood, where the mother frequently walked. Approximately 2.5 months before the admission, the parents had vacationed on an island off the coast of Massachusetts; years earlier, they had visited the Caribbean, which has been their only international travel. The parents reported that they recently had upper respiratory tract symptoms; the family had a pet dog. On examination, the patient was crying vigorously and had pale and mottled skin. The temperature was 39.1C, the blood pressure 101/69 mm Hg, and the pulse 176 beats per minute; the respiratory rate was 68 breaths per minute, with supraclavicular, intercostal, and subcostal retractions, and the oxygen saturation was 97 while the patient was breathing 1 liter of oxygen through a nasal cannula. The anterior fontanelle was soft and flat, and there was no scleral icterus. A holosystolic-flow murmur, grade 26, was heard. The abdomen was soft, without tenderness or distention, and the spleen was palpated 2 to 3 cm below the costal margin. The arms and legs were mottled and slightly cool. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, phosphorus, ionized calcium, and cre-atine kinase were normal, as were the results of coagulation tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, a finding consistent with pulmonary edema, and a hazy opacity in the left upper abdomen, a finding consistent with splenomegaly Fig. 1. Results of ultrasonography of the head were normal. A transthoracic echocardiogram was normal for the patients age, with a patent foramen ovale and left-to-right shunting. A diagnosis was made.

The patient had been in good health until 2 weeks before admission, when fatigue developed. Eleven days before presentation, he had moved to the United States from Indonesia. After his arrival, he had bloating and nonbloody, loose bowel movements, without fever, chills, vomiting, cramping, or abdominal pain. One week later, the diarrhea persisted and his exercise tolerance sharply decreased. The day before admission, he was seen at his local health center. Testing included a complete blood count Table 1 and stool examination. He was referred to this hospital for admission. The patient reported weight loss of approximately 4.5 kg in recent weeks, without dyspnea, night sweats, fevers, chills, rash, arthritis, cough, pruritus, alcohol intolerance, or hypersensitivity to insect bites. Two years earlier, the patient had presented with intermittent diarrhea, abdominal cramping, tenesmus, nausea, and weight loss 9 kg; there had been microscopic blood in the stool, and a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis had been confirmed by colonoscopy and biopsy. Symptoms had responded to treatment with mesalamine. Complete blood counts at the time of the diagnosis and 7 months before this admission had been normal. On his admission to this hospital, the patients medications included mesalamine 1.2 g daily and acetaminophen as needed for headache. He had no known allergies. He was born in India and had lived in Indonesia and Australia during the previous 25 years. He had traveled to a rural area in India in the previous month. He was married, reported being monogamous with his wife, and had no children. He had moved to the United States to attend graduate school. He was a vegetarian, drank alcohol infrequently, had a remote history of light smoking, and did not use illicit drugs. His parents and brother were healthy. There was no family history of cancer or autoimmune disease. On examination of the patient, the vital signs were normal. The spleen tip was palpable, and an erythematous papular rash was seen on the anterior thorax; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of creatinine, magnesium, total and direct bilirubin, amylase, lipase, uric acid, fibrino-gen, creatine kinase, vitamin B12, and tryptase were normal, as were the activated partial-throm-boplastin time and results of d-dimer testing; testing for total antibodies to hepatitis A virus was positive; and testing for hepatitis A virus IgM, antibodies to hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, and hepatitis B virus surface antibodies was negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was normal, and a chest radiograph was normal. Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed numerous enlarged mesen-teric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, as large as 1.4 cm by 2.2 cm by 3.1 cm. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of contrast material, was normal. Four days later, positron-emission tomography with the use of 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose 18F-FDG-PET revealed intense uptake of FDG throughout the skeleton and in an enlarged spleen, with low-to-moderate uptake in retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes. A CT-guided core biopsy of a retroperitoneal lymph node was performed, and the specimen showed reactive hyperplasia with increased eosinophils and plasma cells but no evidence of lymphoma on morphologic studies or flow cytometry. Stool specimens were negative for Clostridium difficile toxin, protozoa, helminth ova, and enteric pathogens. Testing was negative for antibodies to strongyloides, toxocara, trichinella, and human immunodeficiency virus HIV and for cytomega-lovirus nucleic acids. Cultures of the blood and urine were sterile.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Xuemei Cai Neurology: A 29-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of headache, vomiting, and diplopia. The patient had been well until 3 weeks before admission, when headaches, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting developed, followed by anorexia and weight loss 7.3 kg. Evaluation at a student health center, including computed tomography CT of the brain, reportedly revealed no abnormalities. Three days before admission, photophobia, diplopia, neck stiffness, tremulousness of the left hand, and somnolence developed. On the day of admission, the patient became mute. Earlier that day, magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the brain and cervical spine was performed at another hospital after the administration of gadolinium, and a diffusion-weighted image reportedly showed hyperintensity in the cortex along the left frontoparietal region, as well as leptomeningeal enhancement most prominent along the basal cistern, pons, and cerebellum. He was transferred to this hospital. The patients history was obtained from his sister. Two months before admission, he had fallen while snowboarding and had possibly hit his head. He had had surgery at 11 years of age for eustachian-tube dysfunction. He was born in a refugee camp in Southeast Asia and possibly received vaccination with bacille Calmette Guerin; he immigrated to the northwestern United States at 5 years of age. He had traveled to Texas and the Middle East for military service more than 10 years before admission and to Texas 3 weeks before admission. His medications were an unspecified pain medicine for the headaches and suppositories for the vomiting. He had no known allergies. He was a student and lived with a roommate. He drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. While his mother was in a refugee camp, she had had a prolonged illness requiring multiple medications; his sisters were healthy, and there was no family history of autoimmune diseases or cancer. On examination, the patients vital signs were normal. He was somnolent but arousable by verbal stimuli. The neck was rigid. He was nonverbal but could write his name and current location and follow simple commands. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light from 4 to 2 mm, without a relative afferent pupillary defect, and there was no visual-field defect. He was unable to fully abduct the right eye on right lateral gaze. There was lower facial weakness on the right side. He lifted his limbs against gravity, without drift. The remainder of the neurologic and general examinations was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, platelet count, prothrombin time, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total and direct bilirubin, and C-reactive protein. Testing for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus HIV was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 64 beats per minute and ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads that were not thought to be clinically significant. Lorazepam was administered and resulted in some improvement in speech; levetiracetam was added. A lumbar puncture was performed; the results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the neurologic intensive care unit. Three sets of blood cultures were sterile, and three mycobacterial cultures of induced-sputum specimens were negative; one sputum culture grew yeast. Dexamethasone, ethambutol, isonia-zid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, pyridoxine, vanco-mycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, dalteparin, insulin on a sliding scale, and a 2-day course of ivermectin were administered. Dr. Pamela W. Schaefer: MRI of the brain was performed after the administration of contrast material Fig. 1. T1-weighted images show diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement that is most pronounced in the left frontal region and the basal cisterns. There is a focus of restricted diffusion in the left precentral gyrus, a finding consistent with ischemia. Results of magnetic resonance angiography were normal. Thin-section, gadolinium-enhanced images of the orbits, obtained on day 4, show leptomeningeal enhancement surrounding the optic nerves, which appear normal on T2-weighted images. Dr. Cai: On day 2, an electroencephalogram showed intermittent generalized background slowing, without epileptiform activity. Ophthal-mologic examination revealed blurred optic-disk margins, bilateral abducens palsies, and decreased visual acuity 20800 in each eye. On day 3, cef-triaxone and acyclovir were discontinued, and the administration of metronidazole and ceftazi-dime was begun. Liposomal amphotericin B was administered briefly and stopped because of a rash. A tuberculin skin test and an interferon- release assay QuantiFERON-TB Gold test were negative. Myringotomy was performed because of right-sided serous otitis media; cultures of the aspirate were sterile. A repeat lumbar puncture was performed. Cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid CSF disclosed no malignant cells, and flow cytometry showed no abnormal lymphocyte populations; other test results are shown in Table 1. On day 7, craniectomy and biopsies of the right frontal meninges and brain were performed and an external ventricular drain was placed. Pathological examination of the specimens revealed leptomeningeal fibrosis and reactive glio-sis in the cortex. Cultures of brain tissue and CSF were sterile. A test for antinuclear antibody was positive at 1:40 and 1:160 dilutions, with a speckled pattern; a test for hepatitis B surface antibody was also positive, and tests for hepatitis C virus antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, and antibodies to double-stranded DNA, Ro, La, Sm, and RNP were negative. The levels of IgG total and subtypes were normal. During the next 3 weeks, headache, nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite persisted; postural and intention tremors and visual hallucinations developed; and low-grade fevers occurred intermittently. Ethambutol and ceftazidime were discontinued, and the administration of moxi-floxacin, aztreonam, and trimethoprimsulfa-methoxazole was begun. On day 24, a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt was placed, and the external ventricular drain was removed. Blood levels of lactate dehydrogenase and haptoglobin were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Three days later, the diplopia and abducens palsies had resolved, the visual acuity had improved 2040 in the right eye, and 2030 in the left eye, and the optic disks were flat. Vancomycin and aztreonam were discontinued. On day 34, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility. His medications included rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, moxifloxa-cin, pyridoxine, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, a 3-week tapered course of dexamethasone, trazo-done, omeprazole, and ondansetron. During the next 2.5 weeks, he was walking and interacting, with less nausea and improved oral intake. Twenty days after discharge from this hospital, the headaches and tremors worsened and he walked less. Two days later, he was brought to the neurology clinic; on examination, he was alert and oriented, with decreased speech output and impaired attention and repetition the inability to repeat others speech. There was a subtle prona-tor drift in the right hand, moderate postural and intention tremors bilaterally, and a narrow-based stance and stride, with unsteadiness and leaning to the left side. The vital signs, funduscopic examination, and remainder of the neurologic and general examinations were normal. Dr. Schaefer: CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, reveals a 3.6-cm mass in the left inferior frontal lobe with irregular margins and central necrosis. Gadolinium-enhanced, T1-weighted images that were obtained the same day show peripheral enhancement of the mass Fig. 2. There are foci of susceptibility in the mass, a feature consistent with hemorrhage, neovascularity, or both. There is also restricted diffusion in the rim of the mass. T2-weighted images show a moderate amount of associated edema. There is persistent diffuse lep-tomeningeal enhancement.

Tuberculous Meningitis: Given the patient's history, the CSF findings, MRI features of leptomeningeal enhancement, and partial response to anti-tuberculous therapy, this is a leading consideration.\n2. Glioblastoma Multiforme: The CT and MRI findings of a mass with irregular margins, central necrosis, and peripheral enhancement strongly suggest a high-grade primary brain tumor.\n3. Cryptococcal Meningitis: The history of yeast growth in sputum culture and the immunocompromised status inferred from advanced neurological symptoms warrant consideration.\n4. Neurosyphilis: The constellation of neuropsychiatric symptoms and history with multisystem involvement calls for a workup for tertiary syphilis, despite negative early serologies.\n5. Viral Encephalitis: The acute onset of headache, photophobia, and MRI findings are compatible with viral encephalitis, necessitating broader viral diagnostic testing.\n6. Autoimmune Encephalitis: Positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) tests and mixed neurological symptoms are consistent with an autoimmune inflammatory response of the central nervous system.\n7. Neurosarcoidosis: The leptomeningeal enhancement, coupled with the systemic inflammatory response, suggests potential neurosarcoidosis even in the absence of specific systemic signs.\n8. Paraneoplastic Syndrome: The rapid progression of symptoms in an otherwise healthy young adult should prompt investigation into hidden malignancies that could provoke paraneoplastic neurological involvement.\n9. Chronic Lyme Neuroborreliosis: Travel history along with mixed neuropsychiatric and meningeal symptoms align with the chronic manifestations of untreated Lyme disease.\n10.

Moore Medicine: A 34-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of increasing dyspnea. The patient had been well until approximately 4 months before admission, when shortness of breath developed. Approximately 3 months before admission, she began to awaken at night with chest tightness associated with fever, coughing, and dyspnea on exertion. She was evaluated in the emergency department at another hospital. A chest radiograph reportedly showed abnormalities in the lower lobe of the left lung, and a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was made; oral antibiotics were administered. Increasing dyspnea and cough developed 2.5 months before admission. A fluticasonesalmeterol combination inhaler and an albuterol inhaler were administered, with minimal improvement. Three weeks before admission, computed tomography CT of the chest performed at the other hospital revealed a moderate pericardial effusion, prominent pulmonary arteries, and scarring in the lower lobe of the right lung. A 2-week course of prednisone was administered, with some improvement in cough and energy, with resolution of chest tightness, but with dyspnea, which occurred with minimal activity and increased at night requiring several pillows to sleep and occasionally at rest. Other symptoms included early satiety, decreased appetite, hoarseness, and leg swelling. She referred herself to this hospitals Womens Heart Health Program outpatient clinic because of her progressive symptoms and pericardial effusion. The patient reported cough productive of white mucus, dyspnea on exertion and when lying on her back, dry mouth for 3 months, heartburn and mild dysphagia, intermittent abdominal pain and diarrhea for 3 months, and hair thinning without alopecia. She also had had symmetric pains in her knees, elbows, and metacarpal and proximal interphalangeal joints for approximately 3 years, which were worse in the morning and had recently improved with prednisone therapy. During the previous 14 months, she had an intentional weight loss of more than 45 kg; during the past 4.5 months, she had a weight gain of 10 kg. She had had Raynauds phenomenon for 1.5 years, eczema since the age of 14 years, and anemia of uncertain cause. On evaluation the previous year, examination of a biopsy specimen of a left axillary lymph node had been benign. She had had cellulitis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA the previous year and herpes zoster three times in the past. Other daily medications included a multivitamin, vitamin D and iron supplements, and calcium acetate. She had taken phentermine in the past. She was allergic to penicillin, latex, and mushrooms. She was married, had children, and had lived in the midwestern and southern United States and New England. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had hyperlipidemia and thyroid disease, her father was deceased, and her children were healthy. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable and had a persistent cough while speaking, which worsened when she moved from a chair to the examining table. The blood pressure was 1581/20 mm Hg, the pulse 115 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while she was breathing ambient air. The height was 171.5 cm, the weight 91.6 kg, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 31. The jugular veins were distended to 10 cm above the right atrium while the patient was lying in a mildly inclined position, and heart sounds were distant, without murmur, rub, or gallop. There was cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, a swollen left proximal interphalangeal joint, leg edema to the knees, a violaceous macule 1 cm by 1 cm on the left inner thigh, and no cyanosis or clubbing; the remainder of the examination was normal. An electrocardiogram ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 115 beats per minute, right-axis deviation, left atrial enlargement, Q waves in the inferior leads, low voltage, and nonspecific ST-segment changes. Dr. Timothy C. Tan: Transthoracic echocardiog-raphy was performed. The parasternal long-axis view of the echocardiogram Fig. 1A reveals a mild-to-moderate pericardial effusion and thickening of the left ventricular walls, features consistent with concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular function was within the normal range. Color Doppler imaging shows the absence of aortic-valve and mitral-valve disease. The para-sternal short-axis view at the base of the heart reveals a dilated pulmonary artery and branches. Color Doppler imaging of the pulmonary valve shows mild regurgitation. M-mode imaging of the pulmonic valve Fig. 1B shows systolic notching, also known as the flying W sign, a feature that suggests pulmonary hypertension. The para-sternal short-axis view at the level of the midven-tricle Fig. 1C shows flattening of the ventricular septum, also known as the D sign, a feature that suggests elevated right ventricular pressures. The apical four-chamber view Fig. 1D shows an enlarged right atrium and right ventricle. The right ventricle was hypokinetic. Color Doppler imaging reveals mild tricuspid-valve regurgitation. The right ventricular systolic pressure was estimated to be 91 mm Hg. The echocardiogram also shows no physiological evidence of tamponade and no congenital lesions that may give rise to a left-to-right shunt. See Videos 1 through 4, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Dr. Moore: The patient was transferred from the clinic to the emergency department at this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 37.8C, the blood pressure 2011/47 mm Hg, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was able to speak in complete sentences. The complete blood count showed a red-cell distribution width of 18.1 reference range, 11.5 to 14.5 and was otherwise normal; the peripheral-blood smear revealed 2 anisocytosis and hypo-chromasia; the white-cell differential count, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and results of tests of coagulation and liver function were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, thyrotropin, troponin T, iron, iron-binding capacity, ferritin, vitamin B12, and folate; testing for troponin I, rheumatoid factor, and antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus HIV types 1 and 2 was negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed 2 blood and trace protein by dipstick and 0 to 2 red cells and few bacteria per high-power field and was otherwise normal; urine pregnancy testing was negative. The patient was admitted to this hospital, and additional imaging studies were performed. Dr. Amita Sharma: The chest radiograph shows enlargement of the right, left, and main pulmonary arteries Fig. 2A. A CT scan of the chest and a subsequent pulmonary CT angiogram confirm enlargement of the main pulmonary artery and no evidence of pulmonary emboli. The right ventricle is enlarged; the wall of the right ventricle is thick 5 mm, with flattening of the interventricular septum. The right atrium is di-lated, and there is reflux of intravenous contrast material into the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins. A small pericardial effusion is present. There is bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy but no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. The lungs are clear, with no evidence of interstitial lung disease or emphysema. The airways appear normal Fig. 2B, 2C, and 2D. A ventilationperfusion lung scan was normal. Dr. Moore: During the patients first 3 days in the hospital, metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide, and furosemide were administered; systolic blood pressures decreased to between 120 mm Hg and 140 mm Hg. On the third hospital day, diagnostic right heart catheterization was performed. Dr. Richard N. Channick: The right heart catheter-ization revealed severe pulmonary hypertension, with elevated right atrial pressure and markedly reduced cardiac output and mixed venous oxygen saturation, features indicating right ventricular failure Table 2. The pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure was normal, making left heart disease unlikely. Dr. Moore: Diagnostic test results were received.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Douglas S. Micalizzi Medicine: A 45-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of a new rash. The patient had been well until 2 p.m. on the day before admission, when nausea, epigastric pain, and vomiting developed. The next morning, he was seen at another hospital, where he reported increasing asthma and right-sided back pain, which he rated at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain. On examination, he was in moderate distress. The temperature was 36.5C, the blood pressure 112/69 mm Hg, the pulse 125 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 35 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94 while he was breathing ambient air. The mucous membranes were dry, and he had scattered inspiratory wheezes, pallor and decreased skin turgor, and puncture wounds on his arms and hands. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was normal. Ipra-tropium and albuterol were given by inhalation, and famotidine, ondansetron, normal saline, metoclopramide, and methylprednisolone were administered intravenously; hydromorphone was then administered because of increasing pain. Dr. Connie Y. Chang: Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed at the other hospital after the oral but not intravenous administration of contrast material, did not reveal any findings of acute disease e.g., bowel distention or bowel-wall thickening to explain the patients severe pain and vomiting. The spleen appeared small, measuring 8 cm in the maximal craniocaudal dimension normal range for adults, 12 to 14 cm, with at least two granulomas. There was also mild enlargement of the caudate lobe of the liver. Dr. Micalizzi: Shortly after CT was performed, skin mottling and livedo developed, and additional history was obtained. Three days before presentation, the patient was bitten on his hands and forearms while bathing his dog; later that day, his wife washed the wounds with hydrogen peroxide. Levofloxacin, piperacillin, and tazobactam were administered at the other hospital. He was transferred to this hospital, arriving approximately 23 hours after the onset of symptoms. On presentation, the patient reported malaise, shaking chills, a burning pins-and-needles sensation in his limbs, and diffuse body pain that he rated at 10 out of 10. He had had head trauma caused by a rusty nail a few days before presenta-tion and dental extractions 1 to 2 weeks before presentation. He also had a history of asthma, mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anxiety, depression, chronic back pain, and alcohol abuse with recent consumption of up to 18 beers daily; he had stopped drinking 3 days before admission. His medications were citalo-pram and omeprazole daily, alprazolam as needed for anxiety, and albuterol and a combination of budesonide and formoterol, which were administered by inhalation as needed for asthma. He was allergic to codeine, and trama-dol had caused auditory hallucinations. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily and had done so for 30 years, and he had used illicit drugs in the past. He reported no recent tick bites or exposures to other animals, sick persons, raw oysters, freshwater, or saltwater. He lived with his wife and his dog, which was fully vaccinated. He worked sporadically and had recently installed air-conditioning systems. His parents both died at 72 years of age from myocardial infarctions. On examination, the patient appeared ill, anxious, and diaphoretic. The temperature was 35.6C, the blood pressure 1541/02 mm Hg, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while he was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, with normal bowel sounds and mild tenderness in the lower quadrants and without guarding or rebound. Diffuse, purple, blanching livedo extended over his arms and legs, there was some mottling on his flanks and abdomen, and his fingers and ears were slightly blue Fig. 1. There were numerous lacerations with necrotic edges and scratch marks on his hands and forearms; the largest mark on his right forearm 3 to 4 cm in length had a surrounding border 5 to 7 cm in diameter with a purplish tinge and without exudate, crepitus, or bullae. Capillary refill occurred in 5 seconds. The remainder of the examination was normal, as were blood levels of glucose, direct and total bilirubin, phosphorus, globulin, lipase, alkaline phosphatase, methe-moglobin, and haptoglobin; other test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph with poor inspiratory effort showed elevation of the left hemidiaphragm that did not have an obvious cause; there was no evidence of pneumonia. An electrocardiogram ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 132 beats per minute and low-voltage QRS complexes, with Q waves and ST-segment elevations 2 mm in the anterior leads. Vanco-mycin, cefepime, metronidazole, alprazolam, and 3 liters of normal saline were administered, and calcium and magnesium were given as needed. During the first 3 hours after presentation, the level of pain decreased rated at 4 out of 10; the respiratory rate ranged from 22 to 40 breaths per minute, and wheezing developed in the anterior lung fields. The rash progressed to involve the back, chest, and abdomen, with purpura that blanched in some areas. During the next 2 hours, the patient became increasingly confused, with delirium and periods of agitation. Additional test results are shown in Table 1. Etomidate and suc-cinylcholine were administered, the trachea was intubated, and positive-pressure ventilation was begun. Penicillin, ceftazidime, doxycycline, heparin, and hydromorphone were added, vancomy-cin was continued, and cefepime and metronida-zole were stopped. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed no evidence of hemorrhage, masses, or infarction. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit. Methylprednisolone was administered. Testing for antinuclear antibodies and antibodies to double-stranded DNA was negative. opacities and bilateral hilar fullness, findings consistent with pulmonary edema, as well as a pleural effusion on the left side Fig. 2A. Dr. Micalizzi: On the second day, the temperature rose to 39.6C. Dermatologic examination revealed diffuse, symmetric, coalescing, reti-form patches of purple ecchymoses and purpura involving most of the abdomen, chest, arms, legs, and face but sparing the forehead. The rash was predominantly nonblanching. Multiple discrete bite and scratch marks were present on the hands and arms; the largest was on the left forearm. The earlobes and fingers had a bluish hue, which persisted with elevation and warming, and did not have bullae, target lesions, mucosal involvement, crepitus, or exudate. Dr. Chang: Radiographs of the right hand and forearms showed soft-tissue swelling but noDr. Chang: A frontal chest radiograph showed soft-tissue gas Fig. 2B. Noninvasive vascular studies revealed thrombosis in the right radial vein; the results were otherwise normal. Dr. Micalizzi: The plasma ammonia level was normal, and testing for antibodies to hepatitis A, B, and C viruses and hepatitis B surface antigen was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration was begun. Clindamycin, meropenem, hydromor-phone, aspirin, omeprazole, ipratropium, and al-buterol by inhalation were administered, and vancomycin and ceftazidime were stopped. Trans-thoracic echocardiography was performed at the bedside and revealed a large wall-motion abnormality in the apical two thirds of the left and right ventricles. On the third day, rigidity and cyanosis of the right arm developed. Irradiated platelets, washed red cells, and additional fresh-frozen plasma were transfused. Narcotic analgesic agents and midazolam were administered for comfort. A diagnostic test result was received.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Laura D. Flannery Medicine: A 59-year-old man was seen in an outpatient clinic at this hospital because of fatigue, abdominal pain, anemia, arthralgias, and abnormal liver function. The patient had been in his usual state of health until approximately 3 days before presentation, when epigastric distress and ankle edema occurred. He also reported increased personal stress, difficulty sleeping, dysgeusia, and nausea. On presentation in an outpatient clinic at this hospital, he reported epigastric pain that he rated at 6 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain and no weight loss. He had a history of asthma, pain and effusion of the right knee associated with a Bakers cyst, occasional swelling of the right ankle, and varicose veins. He had had normal results on colonoscopy 3 years earlier. His medications were pirbuterol by inhalation as needed for asthma and sucralfate as needed for stomach discomfort; he reported no use of nonsteroidal antiinflamma-tory drugs. He lived with his partner and worked in an office. He consumed two or three glasses of wine per night and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. On examination, the temperature was 37.3C, the blood pressure 110/68 mm Hg, the weight 81.8 kg, and the body-mass index BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 25.8. There was pitting edema of the ankles and superficial varicosities of both legs; the remainder of the examination was normal. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were normal, as were results of renal-function tests and blood levels of calcium, total protein, albumin, amylase, and alkaline phosphatase. Other test results are shown in Table 1 and revealed a new anemia as compared with test results from 4 months earlier, which included a hematocrit of 42 and a mean corpuscular volume of 88 m3. Review of a peripheral-blood smear revealed 1 polychromasia and basophilic stippling Fig. 1. A diagnosis of gastroenteritis was made, with possible peptic-ulcer disease and a bleeding ulcer. Omeprazole and sucralfate were administered, tests for blood in the stool and for antibodies to Helicobacter pylori in the blood were ordered, an upper endoscopy was scheduled, and a bland diet was recommended. The patient was instructed to follow up in 3 days, or sooner if his condition worsened.The next day, the patient called his doctor's office to report pain in both legs and increasing dysgeusia. He reported that his stools were looser than usual, without hematochezia or melena. The following day, 2 days after presentation, he was seen by his primary care physician in an outpatient clinic at this hospital. He reported increased abdominal pain, pain in the right knee and both shoulders, and fatigue that had lasted for at least 1 week. On examination, the temperature was 37.2°C, the blood pressure 131//89 mm Hg, the pulse 89 beats per minute, the height 177.8 cm, the weight 80.3 kg, and the BMI 25.4. The abdomen was normal, and the right knee was tender on palpation, with a mild effusion and no erythema; the remainder of the examination was normal. Stool obtained during a rectal examination was negative for occult blood. The patient scheduled a follow-up visit and returned home.That night, the patient presented to the emergency department at this hospital because of diffuse abdominal pain that was worse with eating and radiated to the left side of the chest, neck, shoulder, and back. Pain that was initially intermittent had become constant, and he had had constipation for 2 days. On examination, the blood pressure was 187//90 mm Hg; other vital signs, the oxygen saturation, and the remainder of the examination were normal. The blood level of lactic acid and results of coagulation tests were normal, and testing for antibodies to H. pylori in the blood and for blood in the stool was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones and was otherwise normal. Abdominal ultrasonography was normal. Oxycodone and ondansetron were administered. The patient was advised to avoid acetaminophen and alcohol, and he went home in the early morning hours. Later that morning, the patient returned to the hospital for an outpatient visit and rated the pain at 4 out of 10. He had hypoactive bowel sounds and periumbilical fullness, with no epigastric pain on palpation. The blood level of C-reactive protein was normal, and testing for antibodies to hepatitis C virus, antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and HIV antigen was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. The next day, upper endoscopic examination revealed a hiatal hernia, a nonobstructing Schatzki's ring at the gastroesophageal junction, and nodularity in the duodenal bulb. That evening, the abdominal pain markedly increased. The next day, 5 days after the patient's initial presentation, he returned to the outpatient clinic. He reported pain in the lower abdomen (rated at 8 out of 10), constipation that had lasted for 4 days, nausea with dry heaves, shortness of breath, and insomnia due to pain. On examination, he was tearful and writhing in discomfort. The temperature was 37.5°C, the blood pressure 129//80 mm Hg, the pulse 103 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The bowel sounds were hypoactive, and there was diffuse tenderness in both lower quadrants. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. The patient was transported to the emergency department at this hospital by wheelchair. On examination, he appeared anxious and uncomfortable. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, and he had discomfort on palpation in the lower quadrants. The blood levels of calcium, total protein, albumin, amylase, lipase, and lactic acid were normal, and routine toxicologic screening of the blood was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Radiography of the abdomen revealed a dilated colon, with findings suggestive of stool in the right and transverse colon to a transition point in the proximal descending colon. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of contrast material, revealed a large amount of stool in the cecum and no evidence of obstruction.

Cigarroa Medicine: A 41-year-old man with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL underwent allogeneic peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation, and afterward, fever and abdominal pain developed. The patient had been well until approximately 7 months before admission, when low-grade fevers and fatigue occurred; the fevers were associated with an unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 kg. Five months before admission, pain in his right arm and leg developed. Imaging performed at another hospital revealed deep venous thromboses, and analysis of a peripheral-blood smear revealed a white-cell count of 33,000 per cubic millimeter, with 53 blasts. Pathological examination of a bone marrowbiopsy specimen reportedly revealed 74 lymphoid blasts. A diagnosis of B-cell ALL was made, and cytogenetic analysis revealed the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome BCR-ABL translocation. Induction chemotherapy with a standard multidrug regimen, including cyclophos-phamide, daunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, l-asparaginase, and dasatinib, was administered. Six weeks after the diagnosis was made, follow-up examination of another bone marrowbiopsy specimen revealed morphologically complete remission. Two weeks later, the patient was seen in the cancer center at this hospital for a consultation about allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. He underwent consolidation chemotherapy while an HLA-matched unrelated donor was identified through the National Marrow Donor Program. Plans were then made to proceed with HLA-matched unrelated-donor peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation after myeloablative conditioning. Five months after the diagnosis of ALL and 3 days before the patients admission for the transplantation, pathological examination of another bone marrowbiopsy specimen revealed continued complete remission. One day before admission, a triple-lumen tunneled catheter was placed. The next day, he was admitted to this hospital. The fevers and fatigue that had occurred before the diagnosis of ALL had resolved. The patient had a history of low-back pain and intravenous opiate use. Maintenance chemotherapy, including 6-mercaptopurine and dasatinib, was stopped 2 weeks before admission; medications on admission included enoxa-parin and oxycodone. Palifermin was administered 3 days before admission, for prevention of mucositis. The patient had no known allergies. He had smoked cigarettes for more than 25 years and continued to do so, drank alcohol rarely, and stopped opiate use after receiving the diagnosis of cancer. He lived alone in New England, had one child, and was disabled because of this illness. He was of Native American ancestry. His mother and maternal grandmother had died; both had had lung cancer. The patients maternal aunt had breast cancer, and his father had multiple sclerosis. On examination, the vital signs were normal and the weight was 98 kg. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score was 1 on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating that the patient has no symptoms, 1 indicating that the patient is ambulatory but restricted in terms of physically strenuous activity, and 5 indicating death; the score on the Karnofsky performance scale was 90 on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 indicating that the patient has no symptoms, 90 indicating that the patient is able to perform normal activities with minor signs or symptoms of disease, and 0 indicating death. The abdomen was soft, without tenderness, distention, or organo-megaly. The skin of the right arm had numerous scars and chronic superficial thromboses, features that were consistent with previous intravenous drug use. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and total and direct bilirubin; other test results are shown in Table 1. The administration of allopu-rinol, famciclovir, ursodiol, and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole was begun, and narcotic analgesic agents were continued. During the first week, the patient underwent total-body irradiation and the administration of high-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide. He also agreed to participate in a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of antithymocyte globulin ATG, administered 3 days before stem-cell transplantation, for the prevention of chronic graft-versus-host disease GVHD ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01295710. The administration of fluconazole and ciprofloxacin as infectious disease prophy-laxis was begun on the day before transplantation, as was tacrolimus for the prevention of GVHD; trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole was stopped. On hospital day 9, HLA-matched unrelated-donor peripheral-blood stem cells were infused. As expected, pancytopenia occurred and persisted for many days thereafter; test results are shown in Table 1. Severe mucositis and diarrhea developed, and total parenteral nutrition was initiated for nutritional support. On hospital day 13 day 4 after transplantation and intermittently thereafter as needed, packed red cells and platelets were transfused. On hospital day 15 day 6 after transplantation, the temperature rose to 38.4C. Fluconazole was continued, ciprofloxacin and famciclovir were stopped, and intravenous cefe-pime, vancomycin, and acyclovir were begun; the fever resolved within 32 hours. Loperamide was administered for diarrhea. Episodes of epistaxis and melena occurred on hospital day 18 day 9 after transplantation and intermittently thereafter; aminocaproic acid was administered for the prevention of bleeding due to refractory thrombo-cytopenia, despite multiple platelet transfusions. On hospital day 21 day 12 after transplantation, the temperature rose to 38.4C, and fevers with associated episodes of confusion and hallucinations persisted daily thereafter. Fluconazole was stopped, and micafungin was started. The weight was 106 kg, and there was swelling of the face, erythema and ulceration of the throat and mouth, and edema of the arms and legs. A chest radiograph showed mild pulmonary edema and small pleural effusions. Test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were sterile. Furosemide was administered, without improvement. Four days later, abdominal distention and pain that was localized to the right lower quadrant occurred and was associated with guarding and rebound. Dr. Mahan Mathur: Computed tomography CT of the chest revealed patchy ground-glass opacity in the upper lungs, opacity in the right lower lobe suggestive of atelectasis, apparent esophageal-wall thickening, mild pulmonary edema, and trace bilateral pleural effusions. CT of the abdomen, performed after the administration of contrast material, revealed changes consistent with acute retrocecal appendicitis and inflammation of the cecum, as well as hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, periportal edema, free fluid, and innumerable subcentimeter retroperitoneal lymph nodes Fig. 1. Dr. Cigarroa: Surgical consultants evaluated the patient and determined that he had a very high operative risk, and conservative therapy was recommended. All oral intake was stopped. Metro-nidazole was administered; however, pain and signs of peritonitis worsened and fevers persisted. Blood cultures remained sterile, and testing of the stool for Clostridium difficile toxin was negative. The next day, the patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit ICU. On examination in the ICU, the temperature was 38.8C, the blood pressure 126/70 mm Hg, the pulse 109 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, the oxygen saturation 90 while the patient was breathing ambient air, and the weight 108 kg. He appeared uncomfortable and inattentive. The oral mucosa was erythema-tous, and there were ulcerations of the lips, oral cavity, and throat. The jugular vein was distended above the right atrium, and the jugular venous pressure was 10 to 12 cm of water. Breath sounds were decreased at the right lung base. Bowel sounds were normal, and the abdomen was distended and slightly firm to palpation, with tenderness to percussion throughout, rebound and guarding in the right lower quadrant, and tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant. There was 3 pitting edema to the sacrum. The rest of the examination was normal. The plasma lactic acid concentration was normal. Chest radiography revealed diffuse interstitial pulmonary edema. Supplemental oxygen and additional furosemide were administered; infusion of total parenteral nutrition was stopped. On hospital day 27 day 18 after transplantation, the temperature rose to 40.6C. The blood pressure was 139/94 mm Hg, the pulse 112 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88 while the patient was breathing ambient air. A repeat CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no substantial change. Because of the patients worsening clinical status, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): Given the recent allogeneic stem-cell transplantation and subsequent symptoms of fever, mucositis, and erythroderma, GVHD is a highly likely possibility.\n\n2. Sepsis: The presence of prolonged fever, abdominal pain, and increased heart rate in an immunocompromised patient raises a strong suspicion for sepsis despite sterile blood cultures.\n\n3. Acute retrocecal appendicitis: CT scan findings show inflammation consistent with acute retrocecal appendicitis, a significant cause of abdominal pain and fever in this case.\n\n4. Opportunistic fungal infection: Persistent fever, pulmonary findings, and recent antifungal switches indicate a possible fungal infection such as invasive aspergillosis or candidiasis.\n\n5. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection: The use of immunosuppressive therapy and persistent fever with gastrointestinal symptoms suggest an opportunistic CMV reactivation or infection.\n\n6. Drug reaction: Multiple medications and the appearance of dermatologic and mucosal symptoms could signify a drug reaction, possibly to antibiotics or chemotherapeutic agents.\n\n7. Engraftment syndrome: The constellation of fever, pulmonary edema, and weight gain shortly after stem cell transplantation suggests engraftment syndrome.\n\n8. Streptococcus viridans bacteremia: Given the erythema and ulcerations of the mouth and mucositis, Streptococcus viridans, a common cause of bacteremia in neutropenic patients, must be considered.\n\n9. Bacterial enteritis: Persistent diarrhea and abdominal pain post-transplant might indicate bacterial enteritis, even with unremarkable stool cultures.\n\n10.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Jenny Linnoila Neurology: An 11-month-old girl was seen in the outpatient neurology clinic because of developmental delay. The patient was born at another hospital by vaginal delivery after induction of labor at 38 weeks gestation because of oligohydramnios. The mother had received prenatal care, including obstetrical ultrasonographic testing, the results of which were reportedly normal. Serologic screening tests during pregnancy were reportedly negative. The prenatal course was uncomplicated. The mother took ondanse-tron for nausea and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and reported that there had been less fetal movement in utero as compared with her previous pregnancy. No meconium was present at delivery. The birth weight was 3.0 kg 25th percentile, the length 48.3 cm 25th percentile, and the head circumference 32.5 cm 10th percentile; the 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were both 9. The newborn was admitted to the neonatal nursery. The results of newborn auditory screening were reportedly normal. Tests performed at the New England Newborn Screening Program were negative. She was discharged home on the third day of life. She reportedly fed well and developed and grew normally. She smiled, laughed, and interacted socially, but she vocalized little. At approximately 4 months of age, the infants parents noted that she startled in response to loud sounds. At 6 months of age, she began rolling over from her stomach to her back and vice versa, reaching out for objects, and sitting with assistance. Her length was 69.9 cm 96th percentile, her head circumference 43 cm 72nd percentile, and her weight 8.5 kg 89th percentile. By 9 months, she could grasp objects and feed herself; however, her pediatrician noted that she sat only in the tripod position back bent slightly forward, and arms placed forward with the hands near the feet. Two months later, her parents reported that she sat only briefly and then flopped over and that she had stopped reaching for objects and feeding herself. At age 11.5 months, she was referred to the neurology outpatient clinic at this hospital. The infants parents reported that she often appeared tired and less alert than she had earlier in her life. She did not crawl or pull to stand. She consumed dairy-based infant formula and soft baby foods and had maintained expected trajectories on the developmental curves for height, weight, and head circumference. She smiled, made good eye contact, and responded to her name. She drooled frequently and made occasional mouthing movements. She did not choke or have trouble swallowing, she did not have constipation, and she did not have activity suggestive of seizures. She had had an ear infection at 4 months of age. Immunizations were current. She lived with her parents and her brother 3.5 years of age, who were well. Her mother was of Russian Jewish ancestry and her father of Irish and Italian ancestry. Her mother was gravida 4, para 2, spontaneous abortion 2. The family had traveled to the Caribbean and Italy. A paternal cousin had a mild speech problem; there were no other known neurologic conditions in the family. On examination, the infants facial features were nondysmorphic. The head circumference was 45 cm 50th percentile; the anterior fontanel was soft. Funduscopic examination was unsuccessful. There were two hypopigmented spots on her left thigh; examination with a Woods lamp was negative, revealing no evidence of neurocutaneous lesions. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. On neurologic examination, she was subdued, appeared alert, and intermittently startled spontaneously. Pupillary reactions were normal, and ocular movements were full and conjugate, with horizontal and vertical eye movements that tracked the examiners face, bright objects, and light, without saccadic intrusions or nystagmus. Movements of the infants face and palate were symmetric. There were no tongue fasciculations or macro-glossia. She smiled periodically, made brief chewing movements, puckered her lips, and drooled, but she did not vocalize. She turned her head to a bell ring. She opened her hands and moved her fingers. Her legs were extended tonically, with bilateral equinus foot posture plantar flexion and curled toes. When pulled to a standing position, she rose onto her toes. Muscle tone was increased, with rigidity; the heel cords were tight. The plantar reflexes were extensor; grasp and Moro reflexes were absent. A few unsustained beats of ankle clonus were present. In the prone position, she lifted her head briefly. Her head and neck drooped anteriorly when sitting. The asymmetric tonic neck reflex was incomplete. On testing of the parachute reflex abduction of arms, extension of elbows and wrists, and spreading of fingers, elicited when an infant is held in suspension in the ventral position and is tilted abruptly forward toward the floor, she fisted both hands and did not spread her arms. The blood level of aspartate aminotransfer-ase was 159 U per liter reference range, 9 to 80. Other test results, including blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bili-rubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine amino-transferase, and creatine kinase, were normal, as were a complete panel of plasma amino acids and urinary levels of organic acids. An electroencephalogram showed the absence of sleep spindles during a relatively prolonged stage N2 sleep a stage of nonrapid-eye-movement sleep characterized by sleep spindles, infrequent low-amplitude spikes in both centroparietal regions during sleep stage N2 of uncertain clinical significance, and no electrographic or electroclini-cal features of seizures. Dr. Otto Rapalino: Seven days after initial evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head was performed without the administration of gadolinium Fig. 1. The image showed mild diffuse hypomyelination that was most conspicuous in the deep and subcortical supratentorial white matter, with relative sparing of the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. T2-weighted images of the posterior thalami and lentiform nuclei showed a subtle increase in signal. The anterior thalami appeared mildly hyperintense on T1-weighted images and hypointense on T2 -weighted images. Single-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy MRS of the left frontal white matter revealed a slight decrease in the N-acetylaspartate-to-creatine ratio; the metabolite ratios were normal on MRS of the region of the left basal ganglia. Dr. Linnoila: Additional diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Lysosomal disorder; Tay–Sachs disease. ", "prediction": "1. Cerebral Palsy: Given the increased muscle tone with rigidity, abnormal reflexes, and developmental delay, cerebral palsy is a highly likely diagnosis.\n2. Metachromatic Leukodystrophy: The MRI findings of hypomyelination along with developmental regression suggest this genetic disorder that affects the white matter of the brain.\n3. Tay-Sachs Disease: Given the patient’s Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry and the developmental regression noted, Tay-Sachs disease is a possible diagnosis.\n4. Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy: The history of reduced fetal movements and possible perinatal complications could suggest an injury from lack of oxygen to the brain around the time of birth.\n5.

Gandhi Medicine, MGH: A 46-year-old woman with human immunodeficiency virus HIV infection was seen by a clinician in Botswana working in collaboration with members of a Massachusetts General Hospital MGH outreach program because of postcoital bleeding. The patient had been generally well until 6 years before presentation, when weight loss and pelvic pain developed and she requested HIV testing at a government clinic. HIV-antibody testing was positive. Four years 3 months before presentation, the CD4 T-cell count was 193 cells per cubic millimeter Table 1, indicating that the patient was eligible for antiretroviral treatment ART in Botswana. The white-cell count was 3400 cells per cubic millimeter reference range, 3900 to 8600, and the blood level of creatinine was 0.41 mg per deciliter 36 mol per liter; reference range, 0.45 to 0.81 mg per deciliter 40 to 72 mol per liter. Two months later, treatment with a combination of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and efavirenz was begun. At a follow-up appointment 1 month later, a gynecologic examination was performed to evaluate vaginal discharge, urinary frequency, and dysuria. Abnormalities were reported, and administration of a 10-day course of amoxicillin was begun. Pathological examination of the specimen obtained during a screening Papanicolaou Pap test revealed a low-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesion; however, the patient never received this result. Four months after the initiation of ART, the CD4 T-cell count had improved Table 1. One month later 5 months after the initiation of ART, the patient again reported dysuria; a course of nalidixic acid was administered. During the next 18 months, she continued to have recurrent pelvic pain, dysuria, and vaginal discharge. She sought care from traditional healers for these symptoms and postponed reporting the symptoms to her medical caregivers and undergoing a repeat Pap test, since she believed that the traditional therapies would help; the symptoms did not improve. Approximately 13 months before this presentation, the patient reported vaginal pruritus. Speculum examination revealed white patches on the cervix, and a repeat Pap test revealed a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. One month later, on review of the test results, colposcopic examination with biopsy was scheduled for the next available appointment, which was 14 months later. Approximately 10 months before this presentation, a small amount of vaginal bleeding reportedly occurred each time the patient had sexual intercourse; the patient was referred for gynecologic evaluation. One month before this presentation, the complete blood count, the cre-atinine level, and tests of liver function were normal; other results are shown in Table 1. She returned to the HIV clinic for evaluation. The patient reported no dyspareunia. She had undergone menarche at 15 years of age and first had sexual intercourse after the age of 17 years, and she was gravida 7, para 5. Medications included tenofovir, emtricitabine, and efavirenz; she had no known allergies. She lived in an urban area in Botswana with her five children and their father who was also receiving ART for HIV infection. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was employed periodically in a small shop. There was no family history of cancer. On examination, the abdomen was soft, without distention, rebound, or palpable masses. On pelvic examination, there were ulcers at the introitus; a malodorous, fungating lesion, 6 cm by 2 cm, on the right lateral vaginal wall, extending from the fornix to the introitus, with minimal bleeding on contact; and a nodular cervix. The remainder of the general examination was normal. Diagnostic procedures were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Human papillomavirus–related vaginal cancer.

Kradin: A 64-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent pleuritic chest pain and a pleural effusion. The patient had been in his usual health until 3.5 weeks before this admission, when left-sided chest pain developed suddenly; it was not associated with exertion, was worse with inspiration, and was associated with dyspnea. He came to the emergency department of this hospital. He rated the pain at 4 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain and reported that it was unlike any pain he had had before. He had not had a fever or chills. On examination, there were decreased breath sounds on the left side. There was swelling of the right calf, with 3 pitting edema, which the patient described as chronic. The white-cell count and levels of d-dimer and troponin I were normal. Dr. Subba Digumarthy: A frontal chest radiograph obtained at that time Fig. 1A shows a left basilar opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm and blunting of the left costophrenic angle. These features are indicative of a left pleural effusion and atelectasis or consolidation in the left lower lobe. Computed tomography CT of the chest, performed according to the pulmonary-embolism protocol, reveals a small loculated left pleural effusion, with thickened and enhancing pleura Fig. 1B. There is patchy consolidation in the left lower lobe Fig. 1C. These findings could represent pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration, and associated empyema. There are scattered small indeterminate lung nodules, measuring up to 4 mm in diameter. There are no pulmonary emboli. An abdominal CT scan that was obtained 1 year earlier shows no left pleural effusion or thickening Fig. 1D. Dr. Kradin: Metronidazole and levofloxacin were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital 3.5 weeks before the current admission. Fluoroscopic studies revealed normal oropharyngeal swallowing with moderate intraesophageal retrograde flow, a finding possibly consistent with postprandial aspiration. A pneumo-coccal vaccine was administered, and previous influenza vaccinations were documented. Sputum cultures grew very few colonies of yeast and normal respiratory flora. Aspiration of the loculated effusion that was seen on the CT scan was not considered feasible. A mild cough and oxygen desaturation occurred intermittently. The chest pain subsided. The patient was discharged home on day 7, with assistance from visiting nurses for administration of his medications, including a 6-week course of clindamycin and levofloxacin, with possible extension of the course, depending on the results of scheduled follow-up imaging. Seventeen days after discharge, the left-sided chest pain recurred. The patient was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital. He reported that the pain was possibly increased with inspiration, and he rated it at 10 out of 10. He had had an intermittent cough, normal bowel movements, and no recent fevers, chills, chest pain, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, dys-uria, or hematuria. The patient had a history of hypertension, hy-perlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophageal spasm, and bipolar disorder and a remote history of alcohol abuse. He had been seen in the emergency department and admitted to the hospital on multiple occasions during the preceding 9 years because of atypical chest pain, with no evidence of myocardial in-farction; cardiac catheterization that had been performed 7 years before this admission had revealed stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery, which was treated with balloon angioplasty. His pain had been attributed to gastro-esophageal reflux disease and esophageal spasm. His medications were clindamycin, levofloxacin, metformin, metoprolol, albuterol and ipratropium solutions administered by nebulizer, citalopram, olanzapine, clonazepam, lamotrigine, nabumetone, gabapentin, enteric-coated aspirin, omeprazole, simvastatin, levothyroxine, folate, and a multivitamin, and he received oxygen by nasal can-nula at a rate of 2 to 3 liters per minute as needed. He was allergic to codeine. He lived alone, had a pet dog, and was receiving disability payments after previous employment in the retail and gaming industries. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily and had done so for 40 years, had stopped drinking alcohol 20 years earlier, and did not use illicit drugs. He had never traveled out of New England, had never been homeless or in jail, and had no known exposure to tuberculosis, asbestos, or inhalants. His father had died of cardiac disease and lung cancer, and his mother of meningitis. On examination, the patient was somnolent but easily aroused by verbal stimuli. The vital signs were normal, and the oxygen saturation was 96 while he was breathing oxygen by nasal cannula at a rate of 1 liter per minute. There were decreased breath sounds, expiratory wheezing, and rhonchi at the base of both lungs. The abdomen was soft, with mild tenderness in the left upper quadrant. The right lower leg was warm and erythematous, with 3 pitting edema. The remainder of the examination was normal. A complete blood count, urinalysis, and results of tests of coagulation and renal and liver function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, troponin I, and N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide. Toxicologic screening of the blood showed evidence of the patients medications and was otherwise negative. Dr. Digumarthy: A chest radiograph Fig. 2A shows a bandlike opacity in the right lower lung, a feature consistent with subsegmental atelectasis. The left basilar opacity and left pleural effusion are unchanged from the previous study. There are findings suggestive of interstitial pulmonary edema, including indistinct pulmonary vascula-ture, peribronchial cuffing, and hilar fullness. Noninvasive Doppler ultrasonography of the legs is negative for deep venous thrombosis. Chest CT, performed according to the pulmonary-embolism protocol, is negative for pulmonary embolism. The CT scan shows the persistent loculated left pleural effusion Fig. 2B and worsening of the patchy consolidation in the left lower lobe Fig. 2C and 2D. There is a new small right pleural effusion. The previously noted small lung nodules are stable. There is atherosclerotic calcification of the left main and left anterior descending coronary arteries. Dr. Kradin: The patient was admitted to the hospital. The medications he was taking as an outpatient were continued, and morphine for pain and vancomycin were administered. Grams staining of a sputum specimen showed moderate leukocytes, moderate gram-positive bacteria in clusters, and very few colonies of yeast. During the next 5 days, a sputum culture grew enterococcus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and two candida species. A tuberculin skin test was negative at 48 hours. Intravenous ceftriax-one was administered on day 3. A rectal culture grew vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. Induced-sputum specimens were negative for acid-fast bacilli. On day 6, a diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Pleural malignant tumor (malignant mesothelioma or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung). ", "prediction": "1. Recurrent pneumonia: The presence of left-sided pleural effusion, patchy consolidation, and a recurrent cough suggest bacterial pneumonia, which can cause repetitive chest pain with pleural involvement.\n\n2. Empyema: Loculated pleural effusion with thickened and enhancing pleura on CT indicates the possibility of empyema, which fits the recurrent pleuritic chest pain and effusion.\n\n3. Pulmonary edema: Findings of interstitial pulmonary edema, along with indistinct pulmonary vasculature, peribronchial cuffing, and hilar fullness, support congestive heart failure as a contributing factor.\n\n4. Malignancy (lung cancer): Chronic smoking history, left pleural effusion, and unchanged small lung nodules are concerning for a potential malignancy such as lung cancer.\n\n5. Pulmonary embolism: Despite negative imaging, the recurrent nature of chest pain and history of right calf edema warrant consideration of pulmonary embolism.\n\n6. Chronic aspiration pneumonia: The history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and esophageal spasm, along with findings of consolidation, raises the possibility of aspiration pneumonia.\n\n7. Tuberculosis: Chronic cough, intermittent fever, and night sweats, although TB skin test is negative, still make tuberculosis a potential differential diagnosis.\n\n8. Congestive heart failure: Left-sided pleural effusion and signs of pulmonary edema with a history of coronary artery disease are consistent with possible heart failure.\n\n9. Pleural tuberculosis: Persistent left pleural effusion and pleural thickening, with a history of chronic symptoms, may point towards pleural TB.\n\n10. Fungal infection (Candidiasis): Growth of candida species in sputum and rectal culture of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus indicate a possible systemic fungal infection."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Eli Miloslavsky Medicine: A 32-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of a rash, muscle pain, weakness, and respiratory failure. The patient had been well until 10 weeks before admission, when a violaceous rash developed involving the eyelids, elbows, metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints, and knees. One week later, intense generalized muscle pain and weakness developed, including difficulty walking, arising from a squat, and climbing stairs. Two weeks later, examination at another hospital revealed a heliotrope rash a red-to-purple rash on the eyelids, periungual edema, erythematous papules on the fingertips, and moderate-to-severe weakness of the deltoids, triceps, hip flexors, hamstrings, and quadriceps bilaterally. Muscle bulk and tone, deep-tendon reflexes, and the sensory examination were normal. Electrodiagnostic studies of muscle and nerve reportedly showed evidence of a chronic proximal myopa-thy with inflammatory features. Prednisone, 80 mg daily, was administered, with transient improvement in weakness and a reported decrease in the serum creatine kinase level, from 6700 U per liter to 4200 U per liter. Twenty-six days before admission, the administration of azathioprine, 150 mg per day, was begun because of the patients progressive weakness including difficulty raising his arms and tenderness on deep palpation of the proximal limbs. Two days later, tests of coagulation and the blood level of total bilirubin were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Azathioprine was stopped after 2 days because of a rise in the creatine kinase level, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. Computed tomography CT of the chest and abdomen revealed a small left pleural effusion and anasarca. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI performed after the administration of gadolinium reportedly revealed enhancement and edema throughout the major muscle groups of the right thigh. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of skeletal muscle reportedly revealed mildly increased variation in fiber size and occasional degenerating fibers, myonecrosis, vascular injury, and fibrosis. Rituximab and a 5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin were administered. Anemia and hypertension reportedly developed. Red cells 6 units were transfused and antihypertensive agents were administered. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of the bone marrow showed normal trilineage hemato-poiesis and no malignant cells. Fever developed, and a possible pulmonary infil-trate was seen on chest radiographs; vancomycin and ceftriaxone were administered. On the 19th day, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation hospital. He had progressive weakness and was unable to ambulate. During the next 5 days, worsening cough and increasing sputum production developed. On the fifth day, a modified barium-swallow examina-tion reportedly revealed aspiration of thin liquids. Oral intake was stopped and a nasogastric tube placed. The next morning, respiratory distress developed while the patient was in a supine position; the oxygen saturation decreased to 68 while he was breathing ambient air from a previous level of 90. A chest radiograph reportedly revealed air-space disease in the left lower lobe and a small, left-sided pleural effusion. Furosemide, vancomycin, piperacillin and tazobactam in combination, transdermal nitroglycerin ointment, and oxygen were administered, and the patient was transferred to this hospital. Medications on transfer included hydralazine, fondaparinux, cycloben-zaprine, furosemide, metoprolol, and methylpred-nisolone. The patient had had a meniscal repair 10 years earlier. He was married and lived with his wife and two young children and worked in a service industry. He did not smoke or use illicit drugs. His father had hypertension, and two aunts had hypothyroidism; there was no family history of muscle, skin, or other autoimmune disease. On examination, the patient was alert, oriented, and afebrile. The blood pressure was 175/90 mm Hg, the pulse 128 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93 while he was breathing oxygen that was administered through a nonrebreather face mask at a rate of 10 liters per minute. Breath sounds were diminished at both lung bases, and there was no wheezing. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. There were ery-thematous papules on the extensor surfaces of the fingers, elbows, and knees and a heliotrope rash bilaterally. Nontender erythema of the peri-ungual regions was present. There was pitting edema of the arms and legs. Grip strength and the strength of foot dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were 45, and the patient was unable to lift his arms, legs, or head against gravity 25. Red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of globulin, total and direct biliru-bin, magnesium, phosphorus, calcium, N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide, and CA 19-9; direct and indirect Coombs tests and assays for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anti-mitochondrial antibodies were negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Normal saline, metronidazole, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin were administered. CT performed according to the pulmonary-embolism protocol showed air-space opacities and diffuse stranding in the superficial soft tissues, with no evidence of embolism. In the evening on the day of admission, hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure developed Table 1. The patient was sedated, the trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was begun. During the next 2 weeks, a tracheostomy was performed and the patient was weaned from respiratory support to nocturnal pressure-support ventilation. Serum immunoglobulin levels and protein electrophoresis were normal. Examination of a specimen from a second muscle biopsy of the right quadriceps muscle showed tubulo-reticular inclusions within endothelial cells, atrophy of type 2B fibers, and a small area of inflammation. A second 5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin was administered. Stools became guaiac-positive; endoscopic examination revealed two gastric ulcers, which were cauterized. Pathological examination of biopsy specimens from the lesions showed no malignant cells or dysplasia. Testing for Helicobacter pylori was positive; metronidazole and clarithromycin in a 14-day course and a proton-pump inhibitor were administered. Red cells were transfused intermittently, the levels of creatine kinase returned to normal, and the dose of prednisone was tapered to 7.5 mg daily. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation hospital on the 50th day, breathing 40 oxygen through the tracheostomy with a tracheostomy mask during the day and receiving pressure-support ventilation at night. He was able to sit on the edge of a bed with assistance and was lifted to a chair for chair rest. Prednisone was continued at 7.5 mg per day, and the monthly administration of intravenous immunoglobulin was planned. Seven weeks after discharge from this hospital, and approximately 6 months after the onset of symptoms, new erythematous macules and papules appeared on the torso, extremities, and face. Examination of the trunk, limbs, and face revealed discrete, erythematous macules and pap-ules that were too numerous to count Fig. 1. These lesions were characterized by central, white, atrophic and sclerotic centers, violaceous borders, and peripheral hyperpigmentation. A diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Malignant atrophic papulosis (Degos’s disease) in a patient with dermatomyositis. ", "prediction": "1. Dermatomyositis: The patient’s heliotrope rash, Gottron’s papules, muscle weakness, and elevated CK levels are classical signs of dermatomyositis.\n2. Polymyositis: The generalized muscle weakness and elevated creatine kinase levels also suggest polymyositis, though the distinct cutaneous manifestations favor dermatomyositis.\n3. Interstitial lung disease associated with dermatomyositis/polymyositis: The development of respiratory failure and pulmonary infiltrates may indicate interstitial lung disease, a known complication of these inflammatory myopathies.\n4. Drug-induced myopathy: The muscle pain and weakness following azathioprine administration could suggest a drug-induced myopathy, although the persistence of symptoms upon discontinuation makes this less likely.\n5. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): The presence of skin rashes, muscle inflammation, and multisystem involvement prompt consideration of SLE, albeit with some manifestations not fully aligning.\n6. Inclusion body myositis: This can present with muscle weakness and some inflammatory features on biopsy, though it generally has a different pattern of muscle involvement and chronicity.\n7. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP): While less likely given normal sensory examination, CIDP can present with progressive weakness and require exclusion in inflammatory muscle disorders.\n8. Vasculitis: The biopsies showing vascular injury, anemia, and multisystem involvement could suggest a form of systemic vasculitis.\n9. Infectious myositis: Infection such as staphylococcal or viral myositis must be considered, though initial antibiotics and immunoglobulins had limited impact.\n10. Paraneoplastic syndrome: Although initial workup did not show malignancy, the presence of new onset rashes and muscle weakness might warrant re-evaluation for an occult malignancy associated with paraneoplastic dermatomyositis."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Robin M. Jones Neurology: A 19-year-old woman was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit of this hospital in the autumn because of headache, fever, photo-phobia, neck stiffness, and mental-status changes. The patient had been well until 7 days before admission, when headache and nausea developed. She was seen at the emergency department of a hospital in Massachusetts 6 days before admission. The physical examination and laboratory test results were normal. Intravenous fluids and ketorolac were administered, with improvement. A diagnosis of tension or migraine headache was made, and she returned to her college dormitory. Two days later, the patient reportedly vomited and fainted after standing up. She returned to the hospital that night; examination revealed a temperature of 38.4C and was otherwise normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, platelet count, and results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal. Testing for mononucleosis, streptococcal pharyngitis, and influenza was negative, and urinalysis revealed blood that was consistent with menses. Intravenous fluids, ketorolac, metoclopramide, and ondansetron were administered, with some improvement. A diagnosis of possible migraine headache was made, and the patient returned to her dormitory. The next day, the fever persisted, and the patients parents, who had traveled from their home to be with her, administered amoxicillin obtained from relatives who were physicians and ibuprofen. The day before admission, another episode of syncope occurred, without head trauma, after the patient arose from bed. She went to the emergency department of another hospital that is affiliated with this hospital. The patient reported a bilateral parietal headache that was the worst of her life, fever, photophobia, chills, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, dizziness with position changes, neck stiffness that had lasted for 2 days, a mild sore throat, and no cough or abdominal pain. On examination, the temperature was reportedly below 37.1C, the blood pressure 97/64 mm Hg, the pulse 99 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while she was breathing ambient air; the remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal. Polymerase-chain-reaction PCR testing for nu-cleic acid from Babesia microti was negative, as were tests for Anaplasma phagocytophilum, ehr-lichia species, and antibodies against Lyme disease. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Lumbar puncture was performed; results of analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid CSF are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed a moderate amount of blood, with 5 red cells per high-power field 2 days after menses; a urine pregnancy test was negative. Testing of throat specimens for group A streptococcus and of nasal specimens for influenza A and B viruses was negative. A computed tomographic CT scan of the head, obtained without the administration of contrast material, was normal, as was a chest radiograph. The patient received 3 liters of normal saline administered intravenously over a period of 3 hours, diphenhydramine, metoclopramide, and ketorolac. She was admitted to the observation unit of the second hospital. Overnight, the temperature rose to 39.0C, and intermittent double vision and increasing difficulty with ambulation and urination occurred. In the morning, she appeared drowsy and was disoriented with respect to the year. She had neck stiffness, truncal ataxia, rotatory nystagmus, numbness of the face and right arm, and an inability to perform immediate recall of three words. The strength and sensation were normal. The urethra was catheterized, and 1 liter of urine was drained; an indwelling catheter was placed. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 57 beats per minute, a PR interval of 92 msec, and nonspecific T-wave abnormalities. Measurements of venous blood gases are shown in Table 1. Dr. Sandra P. Rincon: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head was performed after the administration of gadolinium and revealed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement Fig. 1A. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR images showed diffuse sulcal hyperintensity Fig. 1B; T2-weighted images showed subtle, ill-defined signal abnormality and mild expansion of the medulla Fig. 1C. There was mild effacement of the sulci that was suggestive of cerebral edema, but the basal cisterns were intact. Dr. Jones: Acyclovir 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 8 hours, ampicillin 2 g every 4 hours, meclizine, ondansetron, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen were administered. The patient was transferred to this hospital and admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. She had a history of headache, eczema, and oral fever blisters. Two weeks before admission, she reportedly had had a diarrheal illness. Before this illness, she had taken biotin for acne; her immunizations were current. She had no known allergies. She was of East Asian descent, was raised in the southern United States, and lived in a college dormitory in Massachusetts. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was not sexually active, had not traveled recently, and reported no exposures to sick persons, farm or domestic animals, raw meats or unpasteurized dairy products, or mosquito or tick bites. There was no family history of multiple sclerosis, sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, autoimmune disease, or connective-tissue disease. On examination, the patient was awake, alert, and oriented with respect to her name and her father but not the place or time; she answered yes or no to questions but often cried out in Chinese or with unintelligible words. The vital signs were normal. There was nuchal rigidity. Her eyes were open most of the time, with constant slow upward ocular movements and predominantly upward deviation. The right pupil was normal; the left pupil was difficult to assess because of ocular movements. She closed her eyes with equal strength and resisted opening them. A sensory examination, which was limited because of her fluctuating attention span and pain from nuchal rigidity, revealed decreased sensation on the left side of the face, decreased sensation to light touch on the right arm, intact sensation to light touch on the left arm, and withdrawal from a mild noxious stimulus to the legs. Her strength was 45 in shoulder extension antigravity with little resistance and 25 in hip flexion an inability to overcome gravity, with a greater decrease in tone in the left leg than in the right leg. The reflexes were brisk throughout, with two or three beats of clonus at the right ankle. The right plantar reflex was flexor, and the left plantar reflex was absent. Cerebellar testing was not performed owing to the patients overall neurologic status. Moderate palpebral conjunctival injection and shotty non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy were seen, and the remainder of the examination was normal. During the first 30 minutes after her arrival, the patients condition worsened; she was unable to follow commands and had increasingly slurred and nonsensical speech. She was transiently se-dated and paralyzed, and the trachea was intubated. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, red-cell indexes, platelet count, and results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of phosphorus, albumin, globulin, amylase, and lipase. Additional test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Rincon: A CT scan of the head, obtained without the administration of contrast material, showed no acute intracranial abnormality. MRI images of the head were also obtained without the administration of contrast material Fig. 1D, 1E, and 1F. FLAIR images showed diffuse sul-cal hyperintensity that had increased since the previous MRI examination. FLAIR images also showed diffuse signal abnormality in the cerebellum and effacement of the cerebellar folia, findings consistent with diffuse cerebellar edema. Diffuse effacement of the sulci had increased since the previous MRI examination, and mild effacement of the basal cisterns was present; these findings are consistent with cerebral edema. Magnetic resonance angiography of the in-tracranial circulation, performed with the use of a three-dimensional time-of-flight technique, revealed no hemodynamically significant steno-sis. MRI of the spine was performed without the administration of contrast material. T2-weighted images showed diffuse, ill-defined hyperintense signal abnormality and mild expansion of the spinal cord from the cervicomedullary junction to the conus medullaris Fig. 2A. The changes in the spinal cord are most prominent in the central gray matter Fig. 2B. Dr. Jones: An arterial catheter and a right femoral central catheter were placed. A solution of 20 mannitol 25 g was administered intravenously; ceftriaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir, and azithromycin were also administered. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Meningoencephalomyelitis, most likely due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae and less likely due to West Nile virus. ", "prediction": "1. Viral Meningoencephalitis: The patient presents with fever, headache, photophobia, neck stiffness, and mental-status changes, along with MRI findings of diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement and cerebral edema, which are consistent with viral meningoencephalitis.\n\n2. Bacterial Meningitis: Although no specific bacteria were identified, the patient’s clinical presentation and cerebrospinal fluid analysis are consistent with bacterial meningitis, necessitating empirical antibiotic therapy.\n\n3. Autoimmune Encephalitis: The presence of psychiatric symptoms, seizures, and autonomic instability suggests autoimmune encephalitis, particularly given the lack of infectious confirmation.\n\n4. Tick-borne Encephalitis: Even though initial tests for common tick-borne diseases were negative, the clinical presentation and neurological findings warrant further investigation into less common tick-borne pathogens.\n\n5. Aseptic Meningitis: The fever, headache, and cerebrospinal fluid findings could be due to aseptic meningitis, potentially from a non-bacterial source such as a virus or drug-induced cause.\n\n6. Toxic Encephalopathy: Considering her recent medication history and the acute onset of neurological symptoms, toxic encephalopathy remains a potential diagnosis that could explain her symptoms.\n\n7. Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM): The patient's MRI findings of diffuse cerebellar and cerebral edema, CNS inflammation, and clinical poly-symptomatic presentation closely align with ADEM.\n\n8. Tuberculosis Meningitis: Although less common, tuberculosis meningitis should be considered, especially given the subacute progression and the MRI findings of diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement and cerebral edema.\n\n9. Herpes Simplex Virus Encephalitis: The rapid progression of symptoms, presence of fever, headache, and MRI findings may be indicative of HSV encephalitis, although initial PCR was negative.\n\n10.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Gregory K. Robbins: A 65-year-old man with a history of emphysema and inflammatory colitis was admitted to this hospital because of dyspnea, hypoxemia, and worsening lung disease. The patient had been well until approximately 3 years before admission, when herpes zoster infection shingles occurred; shortly thereafter, episodes of bloody diarrhea developed, after which a diagnosis of inflammatory colitis was made at another hospital. Two years before admission, mesalamine was administered for treatment of the colitis, with improvement of his symptoms. During the next 2 years, progressive dyspnea on exertion occurred. One year before this admission, pulmonary-function tests were performed, and diagnoses of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD and advanced emphysema were made. Tiotropium bromide was administered by inhalation. During the 6 months before this admission, numerous episodes of worsening dyspnea occurred. Supplemental oxygen 2 liters per minute through a nasal cannula, as needed, multiple courses of antibiotics, and tapering courses of prednisone were administered, with transient improvement. Approximately 5 months before this admission, cough with sputum production developed. Dr. Carol C. Wu: A computed tomographic CT scan of the chest, performed at the other hospital, showed moderately severe centrilobular emphysema with bilateral lower-lobe basilar opacities, which may represent mild atelectasis, aspiration, or pneumonia. The main pulmonary artery was dilated, which can be seen in cases of pulmonary hypertension. Dr. Robbins: Three months before admission to this hospital, a stress echocardio-gram revealed fair-to-poor exercise capacity that was consistent with deconditioning, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 65, diastolic dysfunction, and an estimated pulmonary-artery pressure of 45 mm Hg. The patient traveled to Florida for 1 month and felt relatively well on his return. Approximately 7 weeks before this admission, dyspnea on exertion worsened; supplemental oxygen 2 liters per minute through a nasal cannula was administered. Dr. Wu: A CT image of the chest obtained according to the pulmonary-embolism protocol at the other hospital showed emphysema with bronchial-wall thickening and new tree-in-bud and small nodular and reticular opacities in the lower lobes, the right middle lobe, and the lingula. A new, irregular nodular opacity in the right lower lobe measured 1.8 cm by 1.4 cm. The findings were thought to represent aspiration or pneumonia. There was no evidence of pulmonary emboli. Dr. Robbins: Approximately 3 weeks before admission, dyspnea on exertion worsened and was associated with a nonproductive cough and temperatures to 37.8C; the patient became unable to walk short distances in his home. Prednisone, tiotropium by inhalation, mometasone furoate and formoterol fumarate dihydrate in combination, by inhalation, and azithromycin were administered, without improvement. Oxygen saturation on exertion measured 75 while the patient was breathing 2 liters per minute, and supplemental oxygen was increased to 4 liters per minute through a nasal cannula, 24 hours daily. The administration of levofloxacin was begun, and 2 days later, he was admitted to the other hospital. Medications at home also included metopro-lol, lisinopril, and gabapentin. On examination, the temperature was 36.8C, the blood pressure 119/73 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute; the oxygen saturation was 70 while the patient was breathing ambient air, and it rose to 95 with supplemental oxygen flow at 4 liters per minute. Examination of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds at the right base and diffuse wheezing in the upper lung fields. Blood levels of platelets, electrolytes, glucose, calcium, creatine kinase, and creatinine were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed occasional premature ventricular complexes. Dr. Wu: Posteroanterior and lateral chest radio-graphs showed new hazy opacities in both lungs, most prominently in the right middle lobe Fig. 1A and 1B. CT of the chest was then performed, which revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities Fig. 1C and 1D, with more severe involvement of the right middle lobe, right lower lobe, and superior segment of left lower lobe and less severe involvement of the upper lobes. The tree-in-bud and nodular opacities noted on the previous CT scan had resolved, a finding consistent with resolved pneumonia. There was no evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy or pleural effusions. No evidence of traction bronchiectasis or honeycombing was found, which would have suggested interstitial fibrosis. The heart was not enlarged. Dr. Robbins: Serologic testing, including testing for antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and rheumatoid factor, was negative. A blood test for galactomannan antigen was negative. Prednisone, gabapentin, mesalamine, ipratropium bromide by inhaler, albuterol sulfate by inhaler, and levofloxacin were administered. The patient remained afebrile and without sputum production. Two days before admission to this hospital, his respiratory status worsened. His supplemental oxygen needs increased to 80 oxygen through a face mask to maintain oxygen saturations between 85 and 90. Pred-nisone was stopped, and methylprednisolone and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole were administered. An echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function, an ejection fraction of 50, and a positive bubble study i.e., the injection of agitated saline showed evidence of right-to-left shunting across the interatrial septum. One day before admission, cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries, a mean pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure of 13 mm Hg, and a pulmonary-artery pressure of 39/20 mm Hg mean, 28, with no evidence of left-to-right shunting. On the ninth day, he was transferred to this hospital for further treatment. The patient had hypertension, hyperlipid-emia, and depression. Medications on transfer included methylprednisolone sodium succinate, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, levofloxacin, es-citalopram, gabapentin, heparin, metoprolol, pan-toprazole, mometasone, acetaminophen, and lor-azepam; he also was receiving 80 oxygen through a face mask. He had no known allergies. He was retired, having previously worked in sales. He lived with his wife and pet dogs and cats. Before this illness, he did yard work occasionally and had no known exposures to pet birds or hay and no occupational exposures, including asbestos. He drank two alcoholic beverages daily, did not use illicit drugs, and had smoked for 50 pack-years until stopping 8 months before admission because of dyspnea. His mother had COPD, and his children and grandchildren were healthy. On examination, the temperature was normal, the blood pressure 130/90 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. Breath sounds were diminished, without wheezes or crackles. Oxygen saturation was 67 on arrival, while the pa-tient was breathing oxygen 4 liters per minute through a nasal cannula; it rose to 89 to 90 with the administration of oxygen 10 liters per minute through a face mask, and approximately 2.5 hours later, it increased to 93 with the use of a high-flow face mask that delivered a fraction of inspired oxygen of 60. The remainder of the examination was normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 91 beats per minute, with occasional premature ventricular complexes and possible premature atrial complexes with aberrant conduction. Approximately 3.5 hours after the patients arrival, blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, globulin, and creatinine were normal, as were the platelet count and results of tests of liver function and coagulation; other test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Robbins: Diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "HIV infection with AIDS and pneumocystis pneumonia. ", "prediction": "1. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation: Given the patient's history of emphysema and progressive dyspnea, a COPD exacerbation is highly likely.\n\n2.

Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's pulmonary-artery pressure is elevated, consistent with pulmonary hypertension.\n\n4. Congestive Heart Failure: Despite normal left ventricular function, diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary-artery pressures may indicate congestive heart failure.\n\n5. Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD): The bilateral ground-glass opacities without honeycombing could suggest an underlying interstitial lung disease.\n\n6. Pulmonary Embolism: Although no emboli were found, the high-risk factors and symptoms warrant consideration of pulmonary embolism.\n\n7. Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis: Exposure to pet dogs and cats may lead to hypersensitivity pneumonitis, particularly with the indicated symptoms.\n\n8. Pulmonary Edema: The pulmonary opacities could be indicative of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\n9.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Robert L. Carruthers Neurology: A 68-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of diplopia of 2 days duration. The patient had a history of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, with chronic renal insufficiency. He had been in his usual health until 2 days before admission, when diplopia developed, along with nausea and vomiting, mild headache, and a sensation of unsteadiness while walking. The diplopia resolved when he closed the right eye. The next day, he remained in bed because of fatigue and a sensation of light-headedness when standing. Nausea persisted, without vomiting. On the day of admission, he noted weakness and clumsiness of his left hand while buttoning his shirt. At a scheduled follow-up visit, he was seen by his nephrologist, who noted dysconjugate gaze, with no other neurologic findings, and referred him to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient reported mild nausea and continued diplopia, whereby one image appeared above and to the right of the other with both eyes open; the diplopia had been constant since onset. He did not have headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, vertigo, weakness, numbness, fevers, or chills. He had had a chronic decrease in vision in the right eye due to a cataract, which had not changed. He had not had this combination of symptoms in the past. The diagnosis of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ANCAassociated vascu-litis consistent with granulomatosis with polyangiitis had been made 21 months before this admission. The disorder was characterized by sinus pain and renal insufficiency due to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis; a renal-biopsy specimen obtained at another hospital reportedly showed crescentic glomerulonephritis. The patients condition had improved after treatment with plasma exchange, methyl-prednisolone, and cyclophosphamide; 11 months before this admission, the administration of rituximab was also begun. His baseline blood creatinine level was reportedly 5.4 mg per deciliter 477 mol per liter. He also had hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, and a remote history of steato-hepatitis, bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphies, and laminectomies and lateral fusion between the third and sixth vertebrae of the cervical spine. His medications were rituximab an infusion every 4 months, predni-sone 7.5 mg daily, furosemide, amlodipine, meto-prolol, ranitidine, calcium carbonate with vitamin D, calcium acetate, sodium bicarbonate, dapsone, omeprazole, erythropoietin as needed, and topical mupirocin calcium cream. He was allergic to trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole which caused a rash, simvastatin, and azathioprine. He was married and retired. He drank alcohol in moderation, had a smoking history of 40 pack-years and had quit smoking 5 years earlier, and did not use illicit drugs. There was no family history of autoimmune disorders or neurologic diseases. On examination, the patient was fatigued but arousable. The temperature was 37.2C, the blood pressure 139/91 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93 while he was breathing ambient air. There was mild ptosis on the left side. His pupils and extraocular movements were normal. There was subjective diplo-pia in primary gaze, with greater vertical than horizontal separation. There was left-sided upper and lower facial weakness. Soft-palate elevation was diminished on the left side; tongue protrusion, voice, and hearing were normal. The left hand was held in flexion; strength was 45 mildly decreased in the left wrist extensors, 45 in the left finger abductors, and normal in the right arm. Dysdia-dochokinesia of the left arm was thought to be caused by weakness. There were fasciculations in the left calf. Plantar responses were flexor, with fanning of the toes. Gait was not assessed. The platelet count and results of coagulation and liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, and ammonia; other test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Dr. Michael H. Lev: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head Fig. 1A was performed without the administration of gadolinium because of chronic renal insufficiency. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR images showed mild, scattered white-matter changes, predominantly in the periventricular and subcortical regions, as well as in the midbrain region where there were more changes on the right side than on the left side. These findings are consistent with a chronic microangiopathic disease. Dr. Carruthers: On day 2, the temperature rose to 38.6C. Blood cultures were obtained and re-mained sterile. Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampi-cillin, and acyclovir were administered. A lumbar puncture was performed, and the opening pressure was normal. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Lev: On day 3, repeat MRI of the head was performed Fig. 1B and 1C. FLAIR images showed new, progressive, hyperintense punctate and linear cortical and subcortical foci bilaterally. There were some foci with restricted diffusion suggestive of infarction; these were most notable in the right cingulate, precentral, and postcentral gyri but also in the right midbrain, thalamus, and corona radiata and in the putami-na on both sides. Dr. Carruthers: Methylprednisolone 1 g daily was administered intravenously for 2 days. Hemodialysis was begun. Testing for antitreponemal antibodies was negative. On day 5, the patient became unresponsive during hemodialysis; the temperature was 38.8C, the pulse 90 to 99 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 92 to 94 while he was breathing supplemental oxygen at a rate of 4 liters per minute by nasal cannula. On examination, he was unable to speak and had impaired upward gaze. Measurement of arterial blood gases revealed that the pH was 7.52, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide 34 mm Hg, and the partial pressure of oxygen 81 mm Hg. Hemodialysis was stopped, and the trachea was intubated. The patient was transferred to the neurologic intensive care unit. Glucocorticoids were discontinued. Testing for hepatitis B and C viruses was negative. On day 6, the temperature rose to 39.0C. The thyrotropin level was normal; screening of the blood and urine for toxins was negative. A repeat lumbar puncture was performed; analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid CSF and other test results are shown in Table 1. Sputum cultures grew few colonies of yeast; cultures of blood, urine, and CSF remained sterile. Dr. Lev: Follow-up MRI of the head Fig. 1D revealed a new punctate focus of restricted diffusion in the right pons, along the corticospinal tract; FLAIR images showed new, diffuse hyper-intense signal in the cerebellar vermis bilaterally. Previously noted findings were unchanged or became slightly less conspicuous. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck revealed no evidence of stenotic or embolic disease. The next day, conventional angiography re-vealed no evidence of intracranial vasculitis. Computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed atelectasis and cholelithiasis but no evidence of cholecystitis. Dr. Carruthers: Transthoracic echocardiography revealed no evidence of vegetations. There was no evidence of vasculitis or viral infection on ophthal-mologic examination. Bacterial, fungal, and myco-bacterial blood cultures remained sterile, and testing for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus and for IgG and IgM antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, Bartonella henselae, and Bar-to nella quintana was negative. A tunneled hemo-dialysis catheter was placed. The administration of levetiracetam was begun. On day 8, the patient remained unresponsive, with a temperature as high as 38.4C. The morning cortisol level was normal; blood tests for IgG and IgM anti-bodies to eastern equine encephalitis virus and West Nile virus and a urinary histoplasma antigen test were negative. Additional test results are shown in Table 1. Valproic acid was administered. Dr. Lev: On day 10, MRI of the head Fig. 1E and spine revealed numerous new punctate cerebellar infarcts, without susceptibility changes suggestive of microhemorrhage. The spinal cord was normal, and the previously noted findings were unchanged. Dr. Carruthers: The next day, generalized fasciculations developed. Methylprednisolone 250 mg every 6 hours was administered intravenously. In consultation with the patients family, the goals of care were adjusted to comfort measures, and the trachea was extubated. On day 16, the patient died. An autopsy was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Cerebral vasculitis due to granulomatosis with polyangiitis. ", "prediction": "1.

Ong Cardiology: A 40-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital 10 days post partum, because of dyspnea and hypoxemia. Ten days before admission, the patient went into labor at 39 weeks of gestation. A low transverse cesarean section and tubal ligation were performed electively at another hospital with the patient under spinal anesthesia, without complications. A healthy infant was delivered; the 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were 8 and 9, respectively. A tuberculin skin test was negative, and a tetanusdiphtheria acellular pertussis vaccine was administered to the patient. The patient returned home on the third postpartum day. She remained well until approximately 5 days before admission 5 days after the cesarean section, when gradually increasing orthopnea and dyspnea on exertion developed, associated with mild leg edema. Two days before admission, intermittent substernal chest tightness developed, associated with nausea, vomiting, and a cough productive of blood-tinged sputum but without fever or chills. The night before admission, she went to the emergency department of another hospital because of worsening dyspnea. On examination, the blood pressure was 140/74 mm Hg, the pulse 113 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air; the temperature was normal. The lungs were clear. An electrocardiogram ECG showed sinus rhythm at 130 beats per minute and possible left atrial enlargement, with no ST-segment elevation or depression. Blood levels of total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, calcium, alanine amino-transferase, and aspartate aminotransferase were normal, as were tests of renal function; other test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomographic CT angiography, performed according to the pulmonary embolism protocol with the administration of iopamidol, reportedly revealed an enlarged heart; small, bilateral pleural effusions; patchy air-space disease, with areas of patchy consolidation and thickening of the interlobular septa bilaterally; and no evidence of pulmonary embolism, aortic aneurysm, or pericardial effusion. Two hours after the patients arrival at the other hospital, marked anxiety and increased dyspnea developed. Lorazepam was administered, followed by heparin. The blood pressure rose to 2011/76 mm Hg and the pulse to 173 beats per minute, the respiratory rate was 21 to 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation fell to 64. Etomidate and propofol were administered, the trachea was intubated, and manual ventilation was begun. Approximately 200 ml of frothy, pink secretions were suctioned. Ten minutes later, the blood pressure fell transiently to 7643 mg Hg; the pulse was 111 beats per min-ute, the respiratory rate 31 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 81. During the next hour, succinylcholine, furosemide 40 mg, and mid-azolam were administered intravenously. One liter of clear urine was collected by catheter. The oxygen saturation was 90 with manual ventilation the fraction of inspired oxygen was not recorded; desaturation to 56 to 80 occurred when the patient was mechanically ventilated. Approximately 3.5 hours after arrival, she was transferred by ambulance to this hospital for admission. During transfer, she was manually ventilated; the blood pressure was 88/61 mm Hg, and the pulse was 136 beats per minute, weak, and regular. Seven years earlier, the patients first child was delivered at 40 weeks gestation by cesarean section because of failure to progress and fetal distress. The patient had had two spontaneous abortions, 16 months and 13 months before this admission. She had a history of Graves disease, carpal tunnel syndrome, anemia, and urinary tract infections. Medications before admission included ibuprofen, docusate, and methimazole, and she had taken micronized progesterone and propylthiouracil during the first trimester. She had no known allergies. She was born in South America and had moved to the United States 5 years earlier. She lived with her husband and children and worked as a housecleaner. She did not drink, smoke, or use illicit drugs. Her father had died at 60 years of age from myocardial infarction, her maternal grandmother had died of a stroke, her father and maternal grandmother had had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, as did her mother, and her sister had nephrolithiasis and asthma. On examination, the patient was sedated and intubated. She was breathing spontaneously and showed movement when examined. The temperature was 36.3C, the blood pressure 126/87 mm Hg, the pulse 164 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94 while she was breathing 100 oxygen. The skin was diaphoretic. Jugular venous distention could not be assessed. There were crackles at both lung bases, without wheezing. The heart sounds were rapid and regular. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, the surgical incision appeared clean, and the extremities were cool. Blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bilirubin, alanine ami-notransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, lipase, amylase, and thyrotropin were normal, as were results of tests of coagulation and renal function; testing for antinuclear antibodies ANA and antidouble-stranded DNA dsDNA antibodies was negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed 1 occult blood and trace albumin, with mucin in the sediment, and was otherwise normal; testing for urinary legionella antigen and human chorionic gonadotropic hormone was negative. Dr. Christopher M. Walker: A chest radiograph Fig. 1 shows an endotracheal tube with its distal end 2 cm above the carina. The heart is enlarged, and there is haziness over both costophrenic angles, indicating small bilateral pleural effusions. There are patchy opacities in the middle and lower lung zones, more in the right lung than in the left lung, findings that are most consistent with pulmonary edema. Dr. Ong: An ECG showed sinus tachycardia with nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. In the emergency department, a catheter was inserted into the radial artery. Furosemide a 40-mg bolus, midazolam, and fentanyl were administered intravenously. Approximately 2 hours after arrival, the blood pressure decreased to 61/35 mm Hg, and norepinephrine bitartrate was infused, with improvement to 81/61 mm Hg. Diagnostic procedures were performed.

Byerly Medicine: A 41-year-old man was admitted to this hospital in midsummer because of fever, rash, pancytopenia, and abnormal results of liver-function tests.\nThe patient had been well until 6 days before admission, when fever with a peak temperature of 38.3C, fatigue, headache, and mild sore throat developed. Two days after the onset of fever, he came to the medical walk-in clinic at this hospital because of persistent symptoms. He also had atopic dermatitis, which had been treated intermittently with topical glucocorticoids. He had taken aspirin and acetaminophen for the fever, with transient improvement.\nThe patient had no known allergies. He was born in Europe and had moved to the United States 6 months earlier. He worked in an office and traveled frequently to Europe. Two days before the onset of fever, he had returned from a 3-week trip to Germany, Spain, Portugal, and the United Kingdom, during which he had gone mountain biking and hiking. He had not noted any insect bites. He drank alcohol infrequently, did not smoke or use illicit drugs, and reported sexual activity only with his wife, who was pregnant.\nOn examination, the vital signs were normal. There were tender lymph nodes in the anterior cervical region; the largest was on the right side and measured 1 cm in diameter. A rapid antigen-detection test for streptococcal pharyngitis was negative, and a throat specimen was obtained for culture. A presumptive diagnosis of viral pharyngitis was made.\nTwo days later, the patient returned to the clinic because of fever with a peak temperature of 39.4C, fatigue, malaise, arthralgias, diaphoresis, and mild headache; he did not have neck stiffness, photophobia, cough, or gastrointestinal symptoms, and his sore throat had resolved. On examination, he appeared mildly ill. The temperature was 38.9C, the blood pressure 117/79 mm Hg, and the pulse 102 beats per minute. The conjunctivae were pale and anicteric, and he had mild nasal congestion, a mobile left axillary lymph node 1 cm in diameter that was not tender, and bilateral anterior cervical lymphadenopathy with supple, small lymph nodes. There were multiple pigmented macules on his trunk that reportedly had been present for decades. The throat culture taken 2 days earlier was negative for group A streptococcus. Blood levels of glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, calcium, and total bilirubin were normal, as were results of renal-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed clear yellow urine, with 2 albumin, 1 blood, and 0 to 2 white cells and red cells per high-power field.'\nDr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: A chest radiograph showed a faint, patchy opacity in the left lower lobe that may represent pneumoniaFigure 1.\nDr. Byerly: After blood cultures were obtained and the administration of doxycycline was begun, the patient returned home. The next evening 5 days after the onset of symptoms, he came to the emergency department at this hospital because of fever with a peak temperature of 40.0C and a new rash on his torso that had appeared after the third dose of doxycycline. He reported decreased appetite and had stopped taking ibuprofen and acetaminophen because of gastrointestinal discomfort. He reported having received all recommended childhood vaccinations.\nThe temperature was 38.9C, the blood pressure 136/83 mm Hg, the pulse 95 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while he was breathing ambient air. Bilateral anterior cervical lymphadenopathy was present, as were multiple faint, nonpruritic macules on his upper chest, abdomen, and back. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Blood levels of total and direct bilirubin, phosphorus, and magnesium were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1.\nThe administration of doxycycline was stopped, levofloxacin was begun, and acetaminophen was continued. Overnight, during a febrile episode, the patient's oxygen saturation decreased to 93 while he was breathing ambient air; supplemental oxygen was administered. The next day, the temperature rose to 39.7C. Levofloxacin was discontinued because of the persistent fever, and the administration of ceftriaxone and azithromycin was initiated. Albuterol was given by nebulizer, and the acetaminophen was alternated with ibuprofen.\nAfter 25 hours in the observation unit 6 days after the onset of symptoms, the patient was admitted to this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 38.3C; other vital signs and the oxygen saturation were normal. There was a faint, small maculopapular rash on the chest, abdomen, and back; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures obtained 2 days earlier remained without growth.\nRed papules developed on the patient's forehead and face on the second hospital day and later spread to his arms; the rash was associated with a prickly sensation. The maximum temperature was 38.3C. Results of coagulation tests were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. A repeat chest radiograph showed that the patchy left basilar opacity had decreased in size from the previous study. The patient received prophylaxis with enoxaparin. The administration of doxycycline was restarted, azithromycin was stopped, and fexofenadine was begun.\nDuring the next 2 days, the patient's fever resolved and he felt better. On examination, a few petechiae were noted in the oropharynx. There was a diffuse rash with monomorphic, smooth, nonscaly, dome-shaped, reddish-pink papules 1 to 3 mm in diameter on the face, trunk, arms, legs, hands, and feet but not on the palms or solesFigure 2.\nDiagnostic tests were performed.\n Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Measles", "prediction": "1. Tick-borne illnesses (such as Ehrlichiosis or Lyme disease): Given the travel history and outdoor activities like mountain biking and hiking in areas where tick exposure is possible, tick-borne illnesses with symptoms like fever, rash, and pancytopenia should be considered.\n2.

Krier Pediatrics: A 27-year-old man was seen in the outpatient endocrinology clinic at this hospital because of severe osteoporosis and multiple bone fractures. The patient had been born to a 23-year-old primigravida mother after 40 weeks of uncomplicated gestation. His mother noted that he had intensely blue sclerae at birth; physical examination was otherwise normal. The patients postnatal course was normal, and he was discharged home. When he was approximately 1 year of age, mild delays in speech and gross motor development were noted by his parents and pediatrician, including weakness of the leg muscles and poor body control. He began walking at 16 to 17 months of age and shortly thereafter had the first of multiple fractures. He had had more than 12 fractures before he started school, and approximately 20 fractures before he was 10 years of age; these fractures resulted from minor trauma, twisting injuries, falls, and collisions that occurred during typical childhood daily activities and play. During early childhood, mild cognitive impairment and speech difficulties were diagnosed and speech therapy was initiated. By the time he started elementary school, his language development had reportedly caught up with that of his peers, and he did not require additional speech therapy. He reportedly had mild cognitive challenges in school, for which he was granted extra time on tests and received special-education services, but he attended mainstream classes and graduated from high school. Ankle tendonrelease surgery was performed during childhood to improve the range of motion; contrac-ture of the left ankle persisted. Physical therapy was performed. A bone-mineral-density BMD assessment performed in childhood was reportedly normal. An evaluation by a geneticist at another hospital during the patients early childhood reportedly showed no evidence of chromosomal abnormalities. There was a clinical suspicion of the fragile X syndrome, but definitive testing was not available at the time. When he was in his 20s, the patient began participating in a sports activity program for youth with disabilities, and fractures occurred with an increased frequency; he had had a total of approximately 30 fractures by the time he was 27 years of age. Fractures predominantly involved the ribs, hands, feet, and ankles and did not include fractures of the long bones or compression fractures. Laboratory evaluation for secondary osteoporosis, performed at a second hospital, was reportedly negative. Four months before this evaluation, BMD assessment with the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry DEXA revealed severe osteoporosis. The next month, a 24-hour urine collection contained 120 mg 3 mmol of calcium and a normal level of creatinine; other test results are shown in Table 1. Approximately 1 month before this evaluation, a bone scan performed at another hospital reportedly showed increased technetium uptake in two ribs on the left side, as well as in the right ankle, left hindfoot, and mid-shaft of both tibias, findings that were thought to represent fractures. He was referred to the endocrinology clinic at this hospital. The medical history was obtained from the pa-tient and his mother. He had asymptomatic hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia, and vitiligo. He reported pain, which he rated at 2 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain, muscle cramps in his groin and knees on weight-bearing, occasional pain in his upper body, and occasional palpitations. In the past, he had had bleeding and infections of his toenails after self-induced trauma, as well as acid reflux. He had no history of hearing loss, joint dislocations, nephrolithiasis, eating disorders, lactose intolerance, or celiac disease. Medications included vitamin D3, atorvastatin, and levothy-roxine sodium. He had no known allergies. His diet included dairy products one or two glasses of milk daily and several servings of cheese per week and two to three cans of carbonated soft drinks daily. He exercised with light weights and a stationary bike; walking was occasionally limited by leg pain. He lived with his parents and a sibling, had graduated from a community college with an associates degree, and worked part-time in a service industry. He had casual social contacts through various hobbies. Although he had a few good friends in high school, he was not very social as an adult. He spent time in his room playing online games, worrying, and picking his toenails, which he described as an obsessive behavior. He did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His mother was of French Canadian and Native American ancestry and his father of Dutch and English ancestry. His maternal aunt had osteoporosis and had multiple fractures after 45 years of age after falls, his father had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, his maternal grandmother and uncles had diabetes mellitus type 2, and his sisters were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 125/86 mm Hg, the pulse 67 beats per minute, the height 167 cm 9th percentile, the weight 70 kg 70th percentile, the head circumference 56 cm 73rd percentile, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 25.1. The patient looked older than his stated age and had a prominent forehead, lower jaw, and nasal bridge, as well as a thickened nose and receded hairline. The teeth were short, wide-spaced, and discolored not opalescent, with some periodontal disease, and the palate and uvula were normal. The sclerae were pale blue. There was slight central obesity, some muscle wasting of extremities, and normal virilization and testes. The small joints of the hands and fingers had notable laxity, with a score of 2 out of 9 on the Beighton scale of hyper-mobility the two fifth digits could each dorsi-flex more than 90 degrees; the large joints were mildly contracted. There were patches of vitiligo, as well as hyperpigmentation that was consistent with sun exposure, with no pigmented striae or bruising. He had truncal hypotonia, mild kyphosis, and no scoliosis or vertebral tenderness. He generally spoke with a flat affect but had insight, made jokes at times, and expressed anxiety about being undressed during physical examination. The remainder of the examination was normal. Calcium supplementation and continuation of vitamin D supplementation and thyroid- replacement therapy were recommended. Exercise with weight-bearing and strength training was also advised. Two months later, diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Contiguous gene deletion involving COL1A1, resulting in osteogenesis imperfecta type I, and other genes possibly related to the patient’s complex phenotype. ", "prediction": "1. Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI): The presence of blue sclerae since birth, recurrent fractures from minimal trauma, and severe osteoporosis strongly suggest a form of OI, a genetic disorder affecting collagen production.\n\n2. Hyperparathyroidism: Mild muscle cramps, normal-range calcium levels, and a high rate of fractures could indicate an underlying parathyroid imbalance leading to abnormal bone metabolism.\n\n3. Osteomalacia: Dietary intake, specific vitamin D supplementation, and the presence of muscle cramps raise the possibility of osteomalacia due to inadequate mineralization of the bone matrix.\n\n4. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS): Joint hypermobility, skin abnormalities, and easy bruising suggest an underlying connective tissue disorder such as EDS, which can also predispose to bone fragility.\n\n5. Hypophosphatasia: This condition is characterized by low activity of alkaline phosphatase, leading to poor bone mineralization and thus multiple fractures and skeletal deformities.\n\n6. Fragile X Syndrome: Given the history of speech delays and cognitive challenges, Fragile X should still be considered despite genetic testing not being available initially.\n\n7. Paget’s Disease of Bone: Rapid bone turnover and abnormal bone remodeling can lead to bones that fracture more easily, although rare in this patient's age group, it should be considered.\n\n8. Cushing's Syndrome: The presence of central obesity, muscle wasting, and easy bruising could be indicative of Cushing's syndrome affecting bone density.\n\n9. Marfan Syndrome: The patient’s tall stature, prominent facial features, and joint laxity raise the consideration of Marfan syndrome, although not classic, it is plausible given the family history.\n\n10. Idiopathic Osteoporosis: Despite thorough investigations, some cases of severe osteoporosis remain idiopathic, with an unclear etiology, leading to recurrent fractures and low bone density."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Andrew S. Allegretti Medicine: A 37-year-old man with ulcerative colitis was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and hematochezia of 1 months duration. The patient had been well until 7 years before this admission, when gray stools with mucus and streaks of blood developed. During the next year, evaluation at another hospital led to a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Mesalamine 5-aminosalicylic acid was administered. Four years before this admission, he was admitted to another hospital because of a severe flare of ulcerative colitis. Colonoscopic examination confirmed clinically significant disease extending to the transverse colon, and histologic examination confirmed active colitis. Prednisone and mesal-amine were administered, and the patients condition improved. He declined additional immunosuppressive therapy, and prednisone was gradually tapered off. Approximately 3 years before this admission, the patient was seen in an outpatient clinic at this hospital because of increased stool frequency and hematochezia of 1 weeks duration. He reported that he had previously decreased the dose of mesala-mine and then had stopped it altogether for a total of 2 weeks because of acneiform lesions that he attributed to the drug. He then resumed taking the decreased dose of mesalamine. A tapered course of prednisone was prescribed. He declined azathio-prine treatment. During the next 2.5 years, symptoms of ulcerative colitis flares recurred, for which he sporadically took delayed-release mesalamine and courses of prednisone; 6-mercaptopurine was transiently administered but was discontinued because of elevated liver-function values. He declined antitumor necrosis factor therapy. The patient maintained a grain-free, lactose-free, and sucrose-free diet with probiotics. He was seen intermittently at an outpatient clinic of this hospital for follow-up visits for his ulcerative colitis; laboratory test results from 5 months before this admission are shown in Table 1. Approximately 2 months before this admission, fluctuating symptoms that were thought to be consistent with a flare of ulcerative colitis occurred, including abdominal cramping in the left lower quadrant, frequent liquid diarrhea with urgency, bloody stools, back spasms, and joint pains. The patient declined colonoscopic evaluation, but the fecal calprotectin level was elevated at 473 g per gram of stool normal value, 50. Twenty days before this admission, on follow-up evaluation at an outpatient clinic of this hospital, he reported partial symptomatic improvement with dietary changes, rest, and additional probiotics, and he noted that he was not taking other medications. He was reportedly allergic to penicillins and erythromycins. He asked about possible fecal microbiota transplantation FMT for the treatment of his disease flare; he was informed that FMT was an available therapy for recurrent Clostridium difficile colitis, but efficacy in ulcerative colitis was not proved. On examination, he appeared comfortable; the weight was 67.7 kg, and the remainder of the examination, including an abdominal examination, was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. He declined colonoscopy and 5-aminosalicylic acidbased medications, including enemas. Prednisone was administered. Fourteen days before this admission, the patient began taking an increased dose of predni-sone because of increasing stool frequency up to six episodes daily and persistent hematochezia. Two days later, he had a telephone consultation, and hydrocortisone enemas were prescribed; partial improvement was noted after 5 days. Three days before this admission, he reported fevers with a peak temperature of 38.1C, a stool frequency of four or five episodes per day, and hematochezia. On the day of this admission, the patient returned to the outpatient clinic because of persistent symptoms. He reported that he had urgent, frequent, bloody bowel movements up to 10 times daily, weakness, fatigue, decreased appetite, minor joint pains, left-sided abdominal pain not related to eating, weight loss of 4 kg during the preceding 3 weeks, drenching night sweats, and fever, with a peak temperature of 38.8C the previous evening. He revealed that he had performed home FMT with stool obtained from his wife and 10-month-old child on four occasions several weeks earlier. He had a history of iron-deficiency anemia for which iron had been administered orally and intravenously, low testosterone for which clomiphene citrate had been administered in the past, vitamin D deficiency, anxiety, seasonal allergies, and a positive purified protein derivative PPD skin test for which isoniazid had been administered in the past. Medications also included probiotics and vitamin D3. He lived with his wife and child and worked in an office. He drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke cigarettes or use intravenous drugs. He had traveled to Central America and South America in the past. He was of European ancestry. There was no family history of Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis. On examination, the patient appeared pale and thin. The temperature was 37.8C, the blood pressure 116/56 mm Hg, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 64.0 kg, the height 180 cm, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 19.8. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, with bowel sounds and mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of calcium, glucose, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were results of tests of renal and liver function; other test results are shown in Table 1. Methylprednisolone, normal saline, and iron sucrose were administered intravenously. On the second hospital day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.

The patient had been well until the day before admission, when fussiness, vomiting, and diarrhea developed, associated with decreased oral intake. He was taken to the emergency department at another hospital, where diagnoses of dehydration and gastroenteritis were made. He was treated with ondansetron, and intravenous fluids were administered. His condition markedly improved, and he was discharged home, with instructions to his parents to follow up the next day with a pediatrician. That evening, the patients parents noticed that the boy had respiratory grunting, increased work of breathing, progressive somnolence, and refusal of oral intake, without further stool output. The next morning, on the day of the current presentation, he was difficult to arouse and had recurrent vomiting and decreased urination. His parents took him to the pediatricians office, where he appeared lethargic, with rapid respirations; emergency medical services EMS were called. The patient was in respiratory distress, with grunting and labored abdominal breathing. The blood pressure was 134/70 mm Hg, and the pulse was 177, regular, and strong; the respiratory rate was 56 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 99 while he was breathing oxygen through a nonrebreather face mask. The skin was pale, warm, and diaphoretic; the lungs were clear, and the extremities were limp. The weight was 14 kg. The blood glucose level was 231 mg per deciliter 13 mmol per liter. The patient was transferred by ambulance to the emergency department at this hospital. The patients history was obtained from the parents through a foreign-language interpreter. The patient was born without complication after a full-term gestation and had previously been healthy. His immunizations were current; he was receiving no other medications and had no known allergies. He lived with his parents and 3-year-old brother, who had been ill recently with similar but less severe symptoms. The parents reported no other contacts with ill persons and no ingestions; there were pill bottles at home, but all were closed and in a childproof drawer. On examination, the patient was moaning and minimally responsive, with writhing movements and withdrawal from pain. The temperature was 38.2C, the blood pressure 124/76 mm Hg, and the pulse 172 beats per minute; hyperpneic Kussmaul respirations were variable at a rate of 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 98 while he was breathing oxygen at 15 liters per minute through a nonrebreather mask. The pupils were 3 mm in diameter, round, and reactive. The abdomen was distended and diffusely tender, with hypoactive bowel sounds. There were bounding pulses, with decreased capillary refill time. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Trace stool obtained on rectal examination was guaiac-negative. Monitoring and supportive measures were initiated. A bolus of normal saline was infused and was followed by an additional bolus because of hemodynamic instability. Blood levels of calcium, direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Ceftriaxone and ondansetron were administered, as were morphine sulfate for analgesia and lorazepam for agitation. Consultation with pediatric surgeons was obtained. A radiograph of the chest was normal; an abdominal radiograph showed mild, diffuse gaseous distention and no evidence of bowel obstruction or pneumoperitoneum, and abdominal ultrasonography showed no evidence of intussusception. Rapid respirations and moaning continued, despite analgesia and anxiolytic medications. A nasogastric tube was placed because of increasing abdominal distention, and some coffee-grounds material was aspirated from the stomach; famotidine was administered. In addition, an infusion of 5 dextrose in a solution of 0.45 normal saline and potassium chloride was started after the infusion of a third bolus of normal saline. Additional patient history was obtained, sodium bicarbonate was administered, and a diagnostic test result was received.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Salicylate poisoning.

The patient was born at another hospital after 39 weeks of gestation to a 36-year-old multigravida who had received prenatal care. Prenatal ultrasonography reportedly revealed mild hydronephrosis. Labor was induced because of maternal hypertension. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. On examination, microcephaly was noted; there were no dysmorphic features. The weight was 2.9 kg 13th percentile, the length 50.8 cm 60th percentile, and the head circumference 29.5 cm 1st percentile Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Results of the Massachusetts Newborn Screening Panel, which can identify more than 60 disorders, were normal. On the patients 18th day of life, radiographs of the head showed no abnormalities other than a small calvarium. Testing for toxoplasma and rubella was positive for IgG antibodies and negative for IgM antibodies; testing for cytomegalovirus was negative. At 3 weeks of age, he was evaluated by the genetics service at a second hospital because of microcephaly. His parents reported that he rolled his eyes when upset and had labored breathing after feeding but was otherwise well. On examination, there was microcephaly, the coronal ridges were palpable, and there were no other abnormalities. Array-comparative genomic hybridization testing revealed 16p11.2 duplication, which was thought to be benign. His infant formula was changed, and symptoms associated with feedings improved. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI that was performed when the infant was 6.5 weeks of age reportedly revealed a small brain, delayed myelination, and partial agenesis of the posterior corpus callosum. At 5 months of age, the patient was unable to roll over, constipation had developed, and his mother noted poor visual tracking. One month later, neurologic examination revealed pupils that were equal in size and reactive to light, decreased visual fixation, and failure to track. There was decreased truncal control, axial hypotonia, and near-normal tone in the arms and legs, which the patient could move normally. Muscle bulk and deep-tendon reflexes were normal; plantar reflexes were flexor. Neuro-ophthalmologic examination did not reveal optic-nerve hypoplasia. A diagnosis of cortical blindness was made. Genetic testing for the primary microcephaly syndromes was suggested. Twenty days before the current admission, episodes of head bobbing and perioral cyanosis occurred during feedings. Three days later, the patient was admitted to the second hospital, where he reportedly had episodes of respiratory distress with agitation or repositioning. On examination during an episode, he had near-agonal breathing with costal retractions and without tachypnea, an oxygen saturation between 80 and 89, head bobbing, grunting, back arching, limb extension, increased muscle tone, cool and mottled arms and legs, perioral cyanosis, and a decreased heart rate of approximately 75 beats per minute. The episodes occurred several times daily, resolved with oxygen administration, and when protracted, were followed by long naps. Growth measurements are shown in Figure 1 in the Supplementary Appendix, and laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography of the head reportedly revealed hypodensi-ties in frontal and parietal white matter, mild prominence of the ventricles, and extra-axial spaces containing cerebrospinal fluid possibly normal features for a patient of this age, with no acute hemorrhage, mass, or midline shift. Evaluation for gastroesophageal reflux revealed reflux below the level of the clavicles, without aspiration; an examination with a pH probe revealed no evidence of reflux during the episodes of cyanosis. An electroencephalogram showed slowing of the background rhythm, without evidence of seizure activity during an episode. Famotidine and lactulose were administered, and a nasojejunal feeding tube was placed. The patient was discharged on the seventh hospital day but was readmitted 2 days later because of recurrent episodes of respiratory distress and cyanosis. Oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula. Chest radiographs reportedly showed mild bronchial-wall thickening and low lung volumes. Testing for respiratory viruses was negative. Evaluation of the respiratory and upper gastrointestinal tracts reportedly revealed small diaphragmatic excursions, mild esophagitis, and reflux below the level of the carina, with slow clearing. The transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. On the 10th hospital day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. Medications on transfer included lactulose and lansoprazole. The parents reported that the patient was unable to roll over or sit up without assistance. He received infant formula orally. Immunizations were current, including one dose of seasonal influenza vaccine. He had no known allergies. He lived with his parents and older sibling and received early-intervention services. His parents were white, with no known history of consan-guinity. His mother had had two spontaneous miscarriages; his parents and sibling were healthy, and the maternal and paternal head circumferences were normal. His maternal grandmother had a bifid uvula, but the three-generation family history was otherwise unremarkable. On examination, the temperature was 36.2C, the blood pressure 116/55 mm Hg, the pulse 120 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 50 breaths per minute with deep subcostal retractions, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing oxygen at a rate of 1 liter per minute through a nasal cannula. The lungs were clear. On neurologic examination, the eyes were open when the patient was awake, with no tracking to visual stimuli, but the eyes closed in response to bright light and blinked in response to threat. The pupils contracted from 4 mm to 2 mm bilaterally, and a red reflex was seen. The face was symmetric, without facial diplegia. When the patient was in the supine position, the legs were abducted, the arms extended, and the hands fisted. There were spontaneous, symmetric, and antigravity limb movements. Head control and truncal tone were poor; he was unable to sit up without support and leaned toward the left. Pa-tellar reflexes were brisk 3, and there was sustained clonus at the left ankle and 5 beats of clonus at the right ankle; plantar grasp reflexes were present bilaterally. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, urea nitrogen, total protein, albumin, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, creatine kinase, triglycerides, thyrotropin, copper, and carbohydrate-deficient transferrin were normal, as were the anion gap and results of liver-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Lansoprazole, lactulose, lorazepam as needed for agitation, and glycerin suppositories were administered. On the first hospital day, the patient had two episodes of respiratory distress and cyanosis that were similar to previously reported episodes. The temperature was 35.3C, the blood pressure 98/50 mm Hg, the pulse 75 to 130 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 50 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while he was breathing oxygen at a rate of 3 liters per minute through a nasal cannula. Venous blood gas measurements are shown in Table 1. The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. Bilevel positive airway pressure was administered by face mask, with improvement. On the second day, apnea and cyanosis occurred intermittently. Otolaryngologic examination revealed incomplete vocal-cord adduction. Bronchoscopy revealed mild main-stem and lower-lobe broncho-malacia on the left side. A central venous catheter was placed in the right saphenous vein. Gabapentin was begun. Blood and urine amino acid profiles were reported to be normal selected values are shown in Table 1. Dr. Paul A. Caruso: MRI that was performed the next day, without the administration of contrast material, revealed pontomedullary hypoplasia, a diminutive corpus callosum, and a myelin disorder most consistent with hypomyelination. A sagittal T1-weighted image shows a diminutive pons and medulla, which can be best visualized when compared with an image of an age-matched normal brain Fig. 1. Although the diminutive brain stem may be in part explained by white-matter depletion, the findings raise concern for a component of malformation. The corpus callo-sum is diminutive; the anterior genu and body have formed but are abnormally thin, and the splenium appears deficient as it merges posteriorly with the hippocampal commissure and fornices. The white-matter volume appears reduced as compared with an MRI scan from an age-matched developmentally normal child Fig. 1. By 11 months of age, normal myelination usually results in low signal in parts of the supratento-rial white matter on T2-weighted imaging, but on this patients T2-weighted images, there was hyperintense signal abnormality Fig. 1, which suggests an underlying delay in myelination or a genetic myelin disorder. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed no abnormalities. Dr. Farh: On the ninth day, the patients work of breathing increased, and there was associated bradycardia. Swelling at the site of the central catheter was noted. The catheter was removed and cultured, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents were administered. Test results are shown in Table 1. The trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was begun. Cultures of the blood, urine, and catheter tip were negative, as were tests for respiratory viruses. Ultrasonogra-phy revealed thrombosis of the right common femoral vein. Low-molecular-weight heparin was administered subcutaneously. Dr. Caruso: Because of concern for an underlying disorder of myelination, the patient underwent magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the white matter on the 16th day. During this study, the conventional MRI revealed that thrombus had formed in the sagittal and straight sinuses and that the vein of Galen had become engorged Fig. 2. Dr. Farh: The administration of betaine, folinic acid, riboflavin, hydroxocobalamin, pyridoxine, and carnitine was begun. On the 20th day, a lumbar puncture was performed. The results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis are shown in Table 1. The administration of low-molecular-weight heparin at a dose of 200 U per kilogram of body weight twice daily was required to achieve a therapeutic level. Diagnostic test results were received.

Geyer Medicine: A 39-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of a severe headache, nausea, and photophobia. The patient had been well until approximately 1 month before the current presentation, when a pruritic rash developed below the waist, most prominently on the left upper thigh. The rash was similar to transient rashes he had had in the past. Ten days before this presentation, he was seen in the urgent care clinic at this hospital for evaluation. On examination, there were pigment changes on the face and lower abdomen, scattered small papules involving the lower legs and wrists, purpura on the left thigh, and multiple scattered excoriations. A diagnosis of dermatitis was made, and he was referred to the dermatology clinic. On evaluation at the dermatology clinic the next day, he reported severe itching, including on his ears. He had not used any new soaps or detergents. On examination, there were geometric erythematous-to-violaceous patches and plaques, most notably on the abdomen under the belt buckle and on both legs in the location of the pants pockets, with depigmentation and prurigo nodules, and there was a low density of brown papules 2 to 4 mm in diameter over the trunk and limbs that were consistent with benign nevi. The remainder of the examination was normal. A diagnosis of severe contact dermatitis was made and was thought to be caused by coins or nickel on his clothing. A tapered course of prednisone was administered. Nine days later, at 4 p.m. on the day of admission, a headache developed in the patient that was unlike any pain he had had previously and that was associated with increasing agitation and restlessness. He self-administered ibuprofen, without improvement. He was brought to the emergency department at this hospital by his family. The history was obtained from the patient and his relatives. He rated his pain at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He reported photophobia and nausea, with no fever, neck stiffness, vomiting, cough, dyspnea, head trauma, or chest or abdominal pain. He had melasma and acne; he had had hidradenitis suppurativa and, during the previous 8 years, recurrent pruritic rashes predominantly around the waist and axillae that were associated with transient eosinophilia 910 cells per cubic millimeter 16; reference range, 100 to 300. Four years earlier, the patient had had a partial small-bowel obstruction and un-derwent resection of a Meckels diverticulum. Medications included prednisone and hydroxyzine hydrochloride, as needed for itching. He had no known allergies to medications. Vaccination history was not known. He was born in the Dominican Republic, had immigrated to the United States more than 15 years earlier, lived with his wife and children, and worked indoors in a service capacity. He spoke Spanish as his primary language. He drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. He had visited the Dominican Republic 2 months before these symptoms occurred. On examination, the patient was oriented to person, place, and time and was agitated and tearful, holding his head, and moaning. The temperature was 36.7C to 38.1C, the pulse 153 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while he was breathing ambient air. The mucous membranes were dry. The pupils were 4 mm in diameter and briskly reactive to light. The neck was stiff, with pain on flexion and rotation. Strength was 45 bilaterally, the gait was unsteady, and he was unable to stand without assistance. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, platelet count, and results of liver- and renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, and calcium; other test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial infarction, or intracranial mass lesion. A chest radiograph was normal. Blood specimens were cultured. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 132 beats per minute and was otherwise normal. Lumbar puncture was performed. Results of the cerebrospinal fluid CSF analysis are shown in Table 1. Grams staining of the CSF revealed abundant polymorphonuclear leukocytes and very few gram-positive cocci in pairs. Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir, magnesium, and metoclo-pramide were administered intravenously. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Rifampin, ondansetron, dexamethasone, and a narcotic analgesic agent were added, and acyclovir was stopped.

Motola Gastroenterology: A 29-year-old man was seen in the walk-in clinic at this hospital because of diarrhea and weight loss. The patient had been well until 1 year before the current presentation, when diarrhea with loose, unformed stools developed; the diarrhea occurred up to six times per day and was associated with urgency and mild abdominal discomfort. During the 4 months before this presentation, unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 kg occurred and increasing fatigue developed. He had had no fevers, and the symptoms did not worsen after he ate dairy or wheat products. He had a history of asthma and had had excision of a congenital nevus and inguinal herniorrhaphy in the past. He took no medications and was allergic to penicillin. He was of Italian and Chinese ancestry. He had no known exposure to sexually transmitted diseases or hepatitis. He was single and worked in a retail store. His late grandfather had had hypertension, and his late father had had diabetes mel-litus, thyroid disease, nephrolithiasis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and hypertension; his brother and half siblings were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 1471/02 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, and the temperature 36.8C. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of vitamin B12, folic acid, electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, glucose, glycated hemoglobin, total protein, albumin, globulin, and free thyroxine T4; other test results are shown in Table 1. Testing for the human immunodeficiency virus antibody and p24 antigen was negative, as was serologic testing for celiac disease. After the test results were received, the patient was called and was asked to return to the outpatient clinic the next day. On examination, the blood pressure was 156/91 mm Hg, the pulse was 80 beats per minute, and the temperature was normal. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Testing for hepatitis B virus HBV surface antibody was positive, and testing for HBV surface antigen, core antibody, e antigen, and e antibody was negative, as was testing for hepatitis C virus HCV antibody. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Examination of the stool for ova and parasites was negative, and stool cultures showed normal enteric flora and no enteric pathogens. An appointment in the gas-troenterology clinic was scheduled. Three days after his first presentation, the patient noted increasing nausea and returned to the outpatient clinic. Dr. Dushyant V. Sahani: During that visit, color Doppler ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed mild splenic enlargement, with the spleen measuring 14.3 cm in length normal length, 12 cm. The liver was normal in size and echotexture. The liver vasculature including the portal vein, hepatic veins, and vena cava was patent and had a normal flow pattern Fig. 1. There was no free fluid in the abdomen. Dr. Motola: On follow-up evaluation in the gas-troenterology clinic, 3 weeks after the patients initial presentation, he reported recent early satiety and reddish stools with no frank blood. He reported dry skin but no pruritus, fevers, rash, oral ulcers, joint pains, or skin lesions other than multiple nevi. He had traveled to an island off the coast of New England 10 months earlier but did not recall having any tick bites. There was no family history of liver disease or inflammatory bowel disease. On examination, the vital signs were normal. The weight was 85.3 kg, the height 190.5 cm, and the body-mass index BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 23.5. The remainder of the examination was normal. Testing for mutations associated with hereditary hemochromatosis H63D and C282Y was negative. Three weeks later, esophagogas-troduodenoscopy revealed grade I varices in the lower third of the esophagus; the results were otherwise normal. Colonoscopic examination revealed normal mucosa. Random biopsies of the stomach, small bowel, and colon were performed, after which more bleeding occurred than expected. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimens revealed normal mucosa.

Kramer Medicine: A 50-year-old man with back pain, fatigue, weight loss, and knee swelling was admitted to this hospital because of abnormal findings on magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the spine performed at another hospital. The patient had been generally well until approximately 2 years before the current admission, when persistent pain of the thoracic and lumbosacral spine developed. Approximately 11 months before admission, he fell and had increasing back spasms thereafter, with partial improvement after chiropractic treatment. During the 2 months before admission, he lost approximately 10 lb 4.5 kg and his back pain became more severe; he rated it at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The pain was chronic with exacerbations, was localized in the thoracic and lumbar regions without radiation, worsened when he lay flat despite the administration of narcotic agents for pain control, and diminished with ambulation. Dr. William E. Palmer: On the morning of admission, MRI was performed without the administration of gadolinium at another hospital to evaluate the patients increasing symptoms Fig. 1. Fluid-sensitive images showed that the disk space between the 10th and 11th thoracic vertebral bodies T10 and T11 was filled with fluid, and there was prominent bone marrow edema involving T10 and T11. These findings raised diagnostic concern about the possibility of diskitisosteomyelitis or fracture with pseudoarthrosis. Dr. Kramer: The patient was advised to go to the emergency department at this hospital for evaluation. On arrival, he reported intermittent numbness in both feet greater in the left toes than in the right toes, but he had no shortness of breath, chest pain, leg weakness, or urinary or bowel incontinence. He had hypertension, nonischemic idiopathic cardiomyopathy with global hypokinesis, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, and fatigue with exertion. He had a history of obesity, depression, gout, nephrolithiasis, an adrenal nodule, and elevated results of liver-function tests, as well as one episode of iritis of the left eye 15 years before admission. He had also undergone numerous orthopedic procedures after traumatic injuries, including arthroplasty of the right knee and arthroscopy of the right ankle. The ankle symptoms, which included chronic discomfort requiring prolonged use of crutches, were thought to have exacerbated his back pain. Medications included lisinopril, furo-semide, atenolol, allopurinol, fluoxetine, acetyl-salicylic acid, and thiamine hydrochloride, with hydrocodone and diazepam as needed for back pain and spasms. He had no known allergies, drank alcohol in moderation, and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. He was married, had adult children, and had worked in a service industry until he became disabled by his back and ankle pain. He walked with the use of a cane or crutches. His father had had coronary artery disease. On examination, the blood pressure was 152/82 mm Hg; the other vital signs and the oxygen saturation were normal. There was tenderness on palpation over the paraspinal regions of the lower thoracic and upper lumbar regions, without pain over the spinal processes. The left knee was warm to the touch, and a small effusion was present. There was trace pitting edema bilaterally. Strength was normal in both legs, but there was mild loss of sensation of light touch in the toes. The remainder of the examination was normal. The level of C-reactive protein was 8.5 mg per liter reference value, 8.0, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 17 mm per hour reference range, 0 to 13. A complete blood count, a white-cell differential count, and results of tests of coagulation and liver and renal function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, and globulin. Oxycodone was administered for pain. The patient was admitted to this hospital, and diagnostic tests were performed.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Pritha Sen Medicine: A 78-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus and rheumatoid arthritis was admitted to Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary because of pain in the right side of the throat, odynophagia, and a right tonsillar mass. The patient had been in her usual health until approximately 7 weeks before this presentation, when pain developed in the right posterior region of her throat, which she attributed to recent dental work. Two weeks later, she went to another hospital because of persistent pain; a throat specimen was obtained for culture and amoxicillinclavulanate was prescribed. The throat culture was reportedly negative for pathogenic bacteria. On evaluation by her primary care physician at a second hospital four days later, she reported severe pain in the right side of the throat and odynophagia. The temperature was 36.6C, and there was purulent exudate over the right tonsil and cervical adenopathy on the right side. A repeat throat culture grew normal flora. Amoxicillinclavulanate was continued. Eleven days later approximately 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms, the patient was seen by a rheumatologist at a third hospital for routine follow-up of her seronegative rheumatoid arthritis, for which she was receiving various immu-nosuppressive medications, including methotrexate, antitumor necrosis factor  antiTNF- agents, and prednisone. She also had diabetes mellitus type 2, osteoarthritis, osteopenia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic anemia, and recurrent aphthous ulcers and had had colon cancer in the remote past which had reportedly been cured by partial bowel resection. She had no history of exposure to tuberculosis and had a negative purified protein derivative skin test. Medications at home included prednisone, methotrexate, infliximab, metformin, omeprazole, folic acid, and ferrous sulfate supplements, as well as acyclovir daily. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable. The blood pressure was 140/76 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute. There was prominent exudate at the right tonsillar bed and pain and decreased range of motion in her cervical spine and shoulders; the remainder of the examination was normal. The platelet count and results of liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of creatinine, total protein, albumin, and globulin; other test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was advised to decrease her daily dose of prednisone, and planned doses of meth-otrexate and infliximab were withheld. The following day, on examination by her primary care physician, the temperature was 36.3C and there was persistent right tonsillar exudate. Azithro-mycin was prescribed. Three days later, the patient was seen in the emergency department at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary because of persistent odynopha-gia. She reported pain on the right side of her throat, which she rated at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain, and headache. The pain did not radiate. She reported no fevers, chills, night sweats, malaise, or facial swelling. Otolaryngologic examination revealed numerous shallow ulcerations that were consistent with broken vesicles on the right tonsil. The mucous membranes were moist and pink, the salivary secretions were clear, and the floor of the mouth and the tongue were soft and non-tender on palpation. There was no trismus, ery-thema, or pus in the posterior pharynx. Endoscopic examination revealed minimally edematous turbinates in the nasal cavity, shallow ulcerations along the posterior tonsillar wall, and erythema of the right arytenoid complex with overlying shallow ulcerations to the midline. Oxycodoneacetaminophen was administered. The patient returned home, with instructions to return for a follow-up visit in 1 week. Four days later, on repeat evaluation by her rheumatolo-gist, she reported no relief in her throat pain and odynophagia, despite taking narcotic analgesic agents. The temperature was 36.6C. The right tonsillar bed and right posterior pharynx were ulcerated and covered with gray exudate. The otolaryngologist was contacted and recommended administration of a short course of prednisone at a dose of 50 mg per day. Three days later, she returned to the emer-gency department at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary for a scheduled follow-up visit. She reported persistent pain, which she rated at 10 out of 10, and associated decreasing oral intake. On endoscopic examination, there was decreased exudate on the right tonsil as compared with the amount of exudate seen on the previous examination, as well as resolving mucosal lesions on the posterior oropharyngeal wall and substantial improvement of the mucosal lesion on the right aryepiglottic fold. Prednisone was continued at a dose of 50 mg daily for 5 days and then decreased to a dose of 10 mg daily, and viscous lidocaine mouthwash was added. One week later 2 weeks after her initial presentation at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, the patient returned for follow-up in the emergency department, as advised. On examination, the temperature was 36.1C and the other vital signs were normal. The right tonsil had persistent ulceration and was firm on palpation. Fiberoptic otolaryngoscopy revealed a tonsillar mass and ulcer extending along the right pharyngeal wall to the aryepiglottic fold, as well as persistent white exudate over the right aryepi-glottic fold. An appointment in the head and neck clinic was scheduled for 3 days later. In the clinic, the patient reported burning pain which she rated at 10 out of 10, pain on swallowing, a globus sensation in the right side of her throat, weight loss of 4.5 to 5 kg since the onset of symptoms, and weakness. An ulcer extended along the right posterior pharyngeal wall to the larynx. The vocal cords were mobile and symmetric bilaterally. The following day, the patient was admitted to this hospital. Medications on admission included prednisone, oxycodone acetaminophen, omeprazole, glyburide, metfor-min, acyclovir, simvastatin, lisinopril, aspirin, amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, calcium, and vitamin D. The patient was widowed and lived alone, with her adult children living nearby. She was born in South America and had last visited 15 years earlier. She had traveled to a rural area in New England 3 months before this admission and had worked in a garden in that area for several days. She had no exposures to sick people, pets, or other animals. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There was no family history of head or neck cancer. The platelet count and results of coagulation and renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, calcium, and magnesium; other test results are shown in Table 1. Intravenous fluids were administered. Dr. Amy F. Juliano: Computed tomography CT of the neck, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed abnormally thickened and enhancing soft tissue around the right glossotonsillar sulcus, extending to the right palatine tonsil Fig. 1A. The thickened soft tissue continued inferiorly, involving the right lateral pharyngeal wall Fig. 1B, and extended to the right aspect of the epiglottis Fig. 1C and the right aryepiglottic fold Fig. 1D. Asymmetrically prominent lymph nodes were present in the right side of the neck Fig. 1E. A few lymph nodes were slightly irregular, with hazy margins. Dr. Sen: Glucose levels ranged from normal values to 263 mg per deciliter 14.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 67 to 106 mg per deciliter 3.7 to 5.9 mmol per liter, and insulin was administered on a sliding scale, as needed. On the third day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Oropharyngeal and laryngeal histoplasmosis. This case was discussed at Medical Grand Rounds. ", "prediction": "1. Tonsillar Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Given the persistent ulceration, weight loss, and firm tonsillar mass, this malignancy is highly likely, particularly in an elderly patient with significant pain and non-resolving symptoms.\n2. Deep Neck Space Infection: The patient’s symptoms of severe pain, odynophagia, and extensive tissue involvement on CT could represent an infection such as peritonsillar abscess or parapharyngeal abscess, especially given the immunosuppressive medications.\n3. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Infection: EBV can cause tonsillar hypertrophy and ulcerations, and the patient’s immunocompromised status due to rheumatoid arthritis treatment increases susceptibility.\n4. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection: CMV is another opportunistic infection that can cause ulcerations in immunocompromised patients, bearing similarity to the patient's presentation.\n5. Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection: The presence of vesicular lesions and ulcers, combined with the immunosuppressive therapy, points towards a potential HSV infection.\n6. Oral Candidiasis: This fungal infection can occur in immunocompromised individuals and may present with white exudates and oral ulcerations.\n7. Lymphoma: The presence of asymmetrically prominent lymph nodes alongside significant systemic symptoms like weight loss could indicate a hematologic malignancy such as lymphoma.\n8. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): Chronic acid reflux can cause significant ulcerations and tissue changes extending down the pharyngeal wall, and should be considered despite lack of classic reflux symptoms.\n9. Tuberculosis (TB): Although the patient had a negative PPD test, TB should still be considered, especially given her travel history, as it can present with ulcerative lesions and significant systemic symptoms.\n10.  Behçet’s Disease: This systemic vasculitis can cause recurrent oral ulcers and other systemic symptoms, which fits the patient's presentation, especially with her history of autoimmune conditions."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Nurse Practitioner Mark S. Brezina Hematology: A 60-year-old man was seen in the outpatient cancer center at this hospital because of bone pain and skeletal lesions on imaging. The patient had been well until approximately 2 months before this evaluation, when he had a gradual onset of pain in the back of his neck and shoulders, which was followed later by a sharp pain in the middle of his back that began suddenly after sneezing. The pain increased after exercise and did not decrease with physical therapy, massage therapy, or a course of prednisone. Dr. Ambrose J. Huang: One month before this evaluation, computed tomography CT of the chest that was performed at another hospital revealed numerous lytic lesions in the thoracic spine and pathologic compression fractures of T5 and T7 Fig. 1. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the lumbar spine with short-tau inversion recovery STIR parameters also performed at the other hospital at that time revealed numerous lesions with high signal intensity involving the vertebral bodies and posterior elements Fig. 2. Nurse Practitioner Brezina: Pathological examination of a bone marrowbiopsy specimen that was obtained at that time reportedly revealed mildly hypocellular bone marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis. Immunoperoxidase stains for CD34, CD117, CD3, CD20, and CD138 and in situ hybridization for kappa and lambda light chains showed no abnormal cells. Examination of the bone marrow aspirate revealed maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and scattered mast cells, including occasional cells with an atypical spindle-shaped appearance. Flow cyto-metric and cytogenetic analysis showed a normal male karyotype; fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH testing for a CHIC2 deletion associated with FIP1L1 PDGFRA fusion was negative. A narcotic analgesic agent was administered. The level of prostate-specific antigen PSA was 2.9 ng per milliliter. One week later, a CT-guided biopsy of a lesion in the iliac crest was performed, and examination of the specimen reportedly revealed slightly hypocellular marrow and a mildly increased number of CD117 mast cells, including spindle-shaped cells. A kyphoplasty procedure was performed at T7 for pain relief; pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of the T7 vertebra reportedly revealed necrosis, fibrosis, and bone remodeling, with prominent osteoclastic activity. Immuno-histochemical analysis revealed a few CD117 mast cells in fibrotic marrow, with no definite coexpression of CD2 or CD25 cells. Ghosts of spindle-shaped cells were observed in necrotic areas. The hematocrit was 37.8 reference range, 41.0 to 53.0, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 74 mm per hour reference range, 0 to 15, and the blood level of tryptase 20 ng per milliliter reference range, 2 to 10. The white-cell count and differential count were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes and 2-microglobulin, results of liver-function tests and serum protein electrophoresis, and the 24-hour urinary histamine level. Testing for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 was reportedly negative, as was FISH analysis for the BCR-ABL rearrangement and testing of peripheral-blood leukocytes for the Janus kinase 2 JAK2 V617F mutation and the KIT D816V mutation. Dr. Huang: Nine days before the current evaluation, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose FDG positron-emission tomography and CT PETCT revealed FDG-avid lesions throughout the axial and ap-pendicular skeleton Fig. 3. Nurse Practitioner Brezina: The day before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the allergy and immunology clinic at a second hospital. Physical examination revealed no cutaneous urticaria, urticaria pigmentosa, or angioedema. Review of the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy specimens and the iliac bone and vertebral-body biopsy specimens showed features that were interpreted as suspicious for but not diagnostic of systemic mas-tocytosis; repeat biopsy of a bone lesion and the administration of interferon- were recommended. The next day, the patient was seen in the cancer center at this hospital. The patient reported severe pain in the neck, back, and pelvic bone, as well as decreased appetite and a weight loss of 4.5 kg during the previous 2 months, intermittent mild heartburn, and no flushing, tachycardia, pruritus, urticaria pigmentosa, or diarrhea. Urinary retention had developed after initiation of pain medications, and he reported psychological stress and anxiety. He had a history of shingles, and until 5 years before this illness, he had had occasional episodes of syncope when standing. There was no history of gastric ulcers, bone fractures, abnormal blood counts, allergic rhinitis, heart disease, or prior surgeries. Medications included alprazolam, mir-tazapine, zoledronic acid administered once by infusion 1 week earlier, a fentanyl patch, hydro-morphone, and tamsulosin for urinary retention after the administration of pain medication. He had no known allergies. He was married and worked at a health care organization. He had a smoking history of 40 pack-years, currently smoked a half pack of cigarettes per day, and drank alcohol occasionally. His mother was over 90 years of age and had dementia, and his father had died at 84 years of age with coronary artery disease and prostate cancer; there was no family history of hematologic cancers. On examination, the patient was alert, oriented, and in pain. The vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. There was mild midepigastric tenderness on deep palpation, without rebound, and tenderness on palpation of the spine in the mid-thoracic and lumbosacral regions. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit was 37.8, the blood level of lactate dehydrogenase 251 U per liter reference range, 110 to 210, the globulin level 4.4 g per deciliter reference range, 2.3 to 4.1, the uric acid level 3.4 mg per deciliter 202 mol per liter; reference range, 3.6 to 8.5 mg per deciliter 214 to 506 mol per liter, and the tryptase level 23.2 ng per milliliter reference value, 11.5; the platelet count, red-cell indexes, and results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, total protein, albumin, and parathyroid hormone. Urinalysis revealed 1 ketones and trace occult blood. A diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Metastatic malignant tumor of unknown primary site. ", "prediction": "1. Multiple Myeloma: Given the lytic bone lesions, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and pain unresponsive to typical measures, multiple myeloma is a leading consideration.\n2. Systemic Mastocytosis: The presence of atypical spindle-shaped mast cells in the bone marrow and elevated tryptase levels are suspicious for systemic mastocytosis.\n3. Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Despite a normal PSA, the patient's history of nonspecific bone pain and skeletal lesions warrants consideration of metastatic prostate cancer.\n4. Primary Bone Cancer (e.g., Osteosarcoma): Persistent bone pain and lytic lesions on imaging may suggest a primary malignancy in the bone.\n5. Paget's Disease of Bone: The pattern of bone pain and skeletal lesions could potentially indicate Paget's disease, although this typically presents with more pronounced deformities.\n6. Lymphoma: Diffuse involvement of the axial and appendicular skeleton might be consistent with a hematologic malignancy like lymphoma.\n7. Osteoporosis with Pathologic Fractures: The thoracic compression fractures and widespread skeletal issues may point to severe osteoporosis, though typically without such pronounced lytic lesions.\n8. Chronic Osteomyelitis: Although less likely without infection markers, chronic osteomyelitis can sometimes present with similar bone changes and pain.\n9. Paraneoplastic Syndrome: The constellation of symptoms could also potentially reflect a paraneoplastic syndrome secondary to an undiagnosed malignancy.\n10. Primary Hyperparathyroidism: Though less likely given normal electrolytes and PTH, the bone pain and skeletal lesions warrant consideration of primary hyperparathyroidism, especially with lytic bone lesions in severe cases."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Nicholas A. Morris Neurology: An 18-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of fever, pharyngitis, facial swelling, and diplopia. The patient had been well until 2 weeks before the current admission, when a headache and sore throat developed, without a fever. On evaluation at her physicians office, a rapid test for streptococcal pharyngitis was negative, and she returned home. During the next 2 days, throat pain persisted and oral intake decreased. She was admitted to the observation unit of another hospital because of dehydration, weakness, and fevers, with a temperature as high as 39.4C. A chest radiograph was normal. The patient reportedly had a white-cell count of less than 2000 per cubic millimeter, positive tests for IgG and IgM antibodies to EpsteinBarr virus EBVspe-cific viral capsid antigen and antibodies to EBV nuclear antigen, and negative tests for heterophile antibodies, influenza A and B viruses, and IgM and IgG antibodies to cytomegalovirus CMV. A pharyngeal culture grew group C streptococcus. Cultures of the blood and urine were sterile. A diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis with possible bacterial superinfection was made. Intravenous fluids were administered, and her condition improved. On day 2, treatment with erythromycin was begun and she was discharged home. Nine days before the current admission, trismus, pain on opening the mouth, and swelling on the right side of the face and jaw developed. The patient returned to the emergency department of the same hospital; parotitis was diagnosed, and ibuprofen was administered. Pain persisted on the right side of the jaw and was associated with temperatures as high as 38.3C and swelling and erythema of the right parotid gland and face. Six days before the current admission, the patient was seen at a second hospital; prednisone and narcotic analgesic agents were administered, and massage of the parotid gland was performed. She returned home. Fevers persisted, and edema of the right lateral side of the face and neck worsened. Three days later, she was seen by her physician and was admitted to the second hospital. Computed tomography CT of the head and neck reportedly revealed no evidence of retropharyngeal or periton-sillar abscesses. Trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, and intravenous fluids were administered. Two days before the current admission, swelling of the right eyelids and horizontal diplopia developed. On evaluation, there was decreased abduction of the right eye. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Jason M. Johnson: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head and neck, performed with and without the administration of contrast material, revealed a multiloculated, rim-enhancing fluid collection in the right parotid gland and inflammation of the masticator space. There was linear enhancement of the pachymeninges in the right temporal region, a finding that raised concern about meningitis. Diffusion-weighted images obtained at the level of the parotid gland showed findings consistent with an abscess. There was an irregularity of the right cavernous sinus, without definite thrombosis. A subperios-teal abscess in the right orbit was also identified. Dr. Morris: The patient was transferred to a third hospital. On examination, she was alert and communicative. The vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. There was diffuse swelling of the right preauricular and periorbital areas, mild trismus, bilateral cervical submental and submandibular lymphadenopathy greater on the right side than on the left, and preauricular and postauricular lymphadenopathy on the right side. White plaque was seen on the gingivobuccal sul-cus and anterior tongue, which was painful when scraped. The right Stensens duct was tender on firm compression, with no fluid discharge. On neurologic examination, the right eye had medial deviation, with an inability to abduct past the mid-line. The patient had mild difficulty with tandem walking. The general and neurologic examinations were otherwise normal. The activated partial-thromboplastin time, red-cell indexes, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were levels of electrolytes, magnesium, globulin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and IgG, IgA, and IgM. Tests for heterophile antibodies, antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus HIV types 1 and 2, and HIV nucleic acid were negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed trace protein, 3 glucose, and 2 urobi-linogen, along with squamous epithelial cells and bacteria, findings suggestive of contamination. Dr. Johnson: MRI of the head, orbits, face, and neck, performed with and without the administration of contrast material Fig. 1, reportedly revealed changes consistent with multiple lobu-lated abscesses in the right parotid gland, with extensive inflammation surrounding the gland that involved the muscles of mastication, as well as a small subperiosteal abscess along the right lateral orbital wall, dural enhancement along the right temporal lobe, and enhancement along the cavernous sinus; these findings were again not thought to constitute definite evidence of thrombosis. Changes consistent with extensive periodontal disease were also seen. Vancomycin, meropenem, and clindamycin were administered. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous fine-needle aspiration of fluid collected in the parotid gland was performed, and the aspirate was cultured. The following day, CT of the sinuses, performed with the administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed preseptal swelling of the right eye extending to the temporal fossa, subperios-teal enhancement adjacent to the right lateral rectus muscle, and heterogeneous enhancement and enlargement of the right parotid gland; there was no substantial improvement in the appearance of the orbital or parotid abnormalities as compared with the previous imaging studies. Dr. Morris: The patient was transferred to Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, which is affiliated with this hospital. Medications on transfer included vancomycin, meropenem, clindamycin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, and enoxaparin, as well as an albuterol inhaler, lorazepam, oxy-codone, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen, as needed. She reported having fatigue and double vision, without headache, pain in her eye or throat, or pain with eye movements. She had a history of dysmenorrhea, for which she took norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol oral contraceptives, and asthma. She was allergic to penicillins, which had caused urticaria, and was possibly allergic to cephalosporins. She lived with her family and attended high school. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs, and she had had no travel-related exposures. On examination, the patient was somnolent but arousable. The vital signs were normal, as was the oxygen saturation while she was breathing ambient air. The right parotid gland, face, and neck were swollen, with marked periorbital edema of the right eyelid, minimal erythema and tenderness, and no palpable fluctuance; the right eye had 1 lateral clear chemosis Fig. 2. The right parotid gland was tender. There was a whitish plaque on the inner aspect of the right buccal mucosa, which was tender and had no obvious abscesses. The patient was able to swallow oral secretions. A systolic murmur, grade 1 out of 6, was heard at the left lower sternal border. There was bilateral submandibular lymphade-nopathy, greater on the right side than on the left. On neurologic examination, visual acuity was 2030 in the right eye and 2020 in the left. In the right eye, supraduction was limited by 50, abduction was slightly limited, and infraduction and adduction were normal; the left eye had normal motility, with splinting on upgaze. Other cranial-nerve functions excluding smell, which was not tested and the remainder of the general and neurologic examinations were normal. Diagnostic procedures were performed, and the patient was admitted to this hospital.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Lemierre’s syndrome caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum, with cavernous-sinus thrombophle-bitis, carotid-artery thromboarteritis, and abscesses of the parotid gland and subperiosteal orbit.

During the 10 days before this presentation, she reported seeing white granular balls, which she thought were mites or larvae, emerging from and crawling on her skin, sheets, and clothing and in her feces, apartment, and car, as well as having an associated pruritic rash. She was seen by her physician, who referred her to a dermatologist for consideration of other possible causes of the persistent rash, such as porphyria cutanea tarda, which is associated with HCV infection. Three days before this presentation, the patient ran out of clonazepam after an undefined period during which she reportedly took more than the prescribed dose and had increasing anxiety and insomnia. The same day, she reported seeing bugs on her 15-month-old son that were emerging from his scalp and were present on his skin and in his diaper and sputum. The patient scratched her skin and her childs skin to remove the offending agents. The day before this presentation, she called emergency medical services and she and her child were transported by ambulance to the emergency department of another hospital. A diagnosis of possible cheyletiellosis was made. She was advised to use selenium sulfide shampoo and to follow up with her physician; the patient returned home with her child. On the morning of admission, while bathing her child, she noted that his scalp was turning red and he was crying. She came with her son to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient reported the presence of bugs on her skin, which she attempted to point out to examiners. She acknowledged a habit of picking at her skin since adolescence, which she said had a calming effect. Fourteen months earlier, shortly after the birth of her son, worsening acne developed that did not respond to treatment with topical antimicrobial agents and tretinoin. Four months later, a facial abscess due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA was successfully treated with oral trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole. The patients son had had a MRSA-related skin infection, and after antibiotic treatment, Clostridium difficile colitis developed, which required hospitalization. The patient reported a history of major depression now in remission but reported having no symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations or delusions, during the periods of depression. She was dependent on sedativehypnotic medications and opiates and occasionally used illicit amphetamine salts; she reported having taken 60 mg of amphetamine salts in recent days. A diagnosis of HCV infection had been made 2 years earlier. She had had diverticulitis and nephrolithiasis, and 4 years earlier, she had a perforated duodenal ulcer that required surgical repair. Medications included buprenorphine and naloxone in combination 8 mg sublingually twice daily, although 20 mg daily was prescribed, sertraline 150 mg daily, until it ran out 2 days earlier, clonazepam 0.5 mg three times daily, until it ran out 3 days earlier, and omeprazole. She had no known allergies. She did not drink alcohol. She had injected oxycodone in the past but reported no opioid use since the birth of her child. She lived with her son, had been unemployed for 2 years, and received transitional food assistance i.e., food stamps. Her maternal aunt had schizophrenia, and her mother had attempted suicide during the patients childhood. On examination, the patient was cooperative, anxious, and disheveled and indicated affected areas of skin to caregivers. The blood pressure was 141/95 mm Hg, and the pulse 100 beats per minute; the temperature and respiratory rate were normal. She was fully oriented. There were excoriations on her face, arms, and legs, but the mid-back was spared. The remainder of the general examination was normal. On mental-status examination, the patient was irritable and somewhat hostile toward a female interviewer but pleasant and cooperative with a male interviewer. She was convinced that she had a parasitic infestation and thought she might have Morgellons a condition in which patients describe inorganic material such as fibers emerging from the skin in combination with cutaneous sensations, which she had read about on the Internet. She pleaded with examiners for their help and belief in her concerns. Her thought process was perseverative and occasion-ally tangential. She intermittently scratched herself. She reported no neurovegetative symptoms of depression other than insomnia. The blood level of phosphorus was 1.9 mg per deciliter 0.61 mmol per liter; reference range, 2.6 to 4.5 mg per deciliter 0.84 to 1.45 mmol per liter, and the blood level of aspartate aminotrans-ferase was 43 U per liter reference range, 9 to 32. The complete blood count, white-cell differential count, and lipid profile were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, total protein, globulin, vitamin B12, folate, thyrotropin, and albumin, as well as the results of other tests of liver function. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones and 3 occult blood by dipstick, mucin, and 5 to 10 red cells, 0 to 2 white cells, few bacteria, few squamous cells, and very few transitional cells per high-power field. A urinary test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative, and screening for toxins was positive for amphetamines. The patient was admitted to the hospital.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Leigh H. Simmons: An 87-year-old man with multiple chronic medical problems was seen in an outpatient clinic of this hospital because of sore throat and fatigue. The patient had been in his usual health until several weeks before presentation, when hoarseness, sore throat, and increasing fatigue developed. At the urging of his family, he was seen by his physician in an outpatient clinic of this hospital. He reported hoarseness, increasing facial puffiness, and periorbital swelling, with no chest pain, dyspnea, or new joint pains or muscle aches. The patient had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. Two months earlier, the creatinine level was 2.22 mg per deciliter 196 mol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter 53 to 133 mol per liter, which was stable, as compared with values obtained the previous year. He also had hypothyroidism, with a normal thyrotropin level 8 months earlier 3.38 U per milliliter reference range, 0.40 to 5.00, as well as gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophageal motility disorder, an abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic back pain, depression related to the death of his wife several years before, and recurrent urinary tract infections. In the past, he had had pneumonia and had undergone angioplasty of the right renal artery 10 years earlier, a cholecystectomy, a lobectomy of the right middle lobe due to a spiculated nodule that was found to be benign, photoselective vaporization of the prostate due to obstructive benign prostatic hypertrophy 2 months before this presentation, and wrist surgery. Medications included atenolol, vitamin D3, a fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhaler, aspirin, citalopram, a flutica-sone nasal spray, atorvastatin, omeprazole, and levothyroxine. Lisinopril had caused a cough, and zolpidem tartrate had caused nightmares. The patient was retired and lived alone. He could independently perform activities of daily living, and he managed his own medications. His three children lived nearby and were in frequent contact with him, but he came to most medical appointments unaccompanied. He was under the regular care of an internist, a nephrologist, a cardiologist, and a urologist. Immunizations were up to date. He had stopped smoking many years earlier and did not drink alcohol. His father had died of liver cancer, and a son had sarcoidosis; his two other children were healthy. On examination, the patient was pleasant, smiling, and in no distress; he spoke with a hoarse voice. The blood pressure was 130/72 mm Hg, the pulse 59 beats per minute, the oxygen saturation 96 while he was breathing ambient air, the weight 86.8 kg approximately 4.5 kg greater than it had been 1 month earlier, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 29.9. There was facial swelling and periorbital edema; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, calcium, phosphorus, and total bilirubin and the plasma anion gap were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. An appointment with an otolaryngologist was scheduled, and the patient returned home. Two days later, when the results of the laboratory tests were known, he was instructed by his physician to stop taking atorvastatin, and a follow-up appointment was scheduled for 9 days later in the outpatient clinic for repeat blood tests.Seven days after presentation, the patient called his doctor’s office at his daughter’s urging to report persistent hoarseness and swelling of his face and abdomen, which he indicated had been present for months but had, according to his daughter, worsened recently. Four days later, 11 days after presentation, he was seen in the outpatient clinic, where he reported markedly worsening fatigue, especially after walking, with associated dyspnea, facial edema, weight gain, cough that produced white mucus, and laryngitis. He reported no chest pain or worsening arthralgias and stated that he was taking all his medications. Chest radiographs were obtained. Dr. Florian J. Fintelmann: Frontal and lateral chest radiographs (Figure 1) showed no changes, as compared with chest radiographs and computed tomographic scans obtained 9 months previously. In addition to sutures from the lobectomy of the right middle lobe, there were small reticulonodular opacities at the right base, findings suggestive of scarring due to recurrent aspiration or prior infection. No evidence of pulmonary edema, lymphadenopathy, or a mediastinal mass was seen.Dr. Simmons: A complete blood count and a white-cell differential count were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, total bilirubin, and C-reactive protein; other test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic test result was received. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Severe hypothyroidism. ", "prediction": "1. Hypothyroidism: Despite a previously normal thyrotropin level, his symptoms of fatigue, facial puffiness, periorbital swelling, and weight gain strongly suggest hypothyroidism.\n2. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The combination of dyspnea, fatigue, weight gain, and peripheral edema is consistent with CHF, particularly in an elderly patient with a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease.\n3. Chronic kidney disease exacerbation: Rising creatinine levels in the context of his chronic kidney disease could explain the worsening edema and general fatigue.\n4. Side effects of medications: Atorvastatin, which he was instructed to stop, can rarely cause myopathy and edema, potentially exacerbating his symptoms.\n5. Superior vena cava syndrome: Facial and upper body edema alongside hoarseness could be indicative of compression or obstruction of the superior vena cava.\n6. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): Symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and facial swelling may be due to untreated or undiagnosed OSA, especially in a patient with a high BMI.\n7. Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR): His longstanding gastroesophageal reflux disease and current symptoms of hoarseness and laryngitis are consistent with LPR.\n8. Medication-induced angioedema: Facial swelling and hoarseness can be symptoms of angioedema, which might be related to his fluticasone or other medications.\n9. Anemia: Though not indicated in the current blood count, if present historically, anemia could explain his fatigue and dyspnea upon exertion.\n10. Vocal cord dysfunction: His persistent hoarseness and a history of inhalant use put him at risk for vocal cord dysfunction, explaining his primary throat symptoms."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Michelle K. Trivedi Pediatrics: A 9-year-old girl with Crohns disease was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain and diarrhea. The patient had been well until 7 years of age, when a diagnosis of Crohns disease was made after she presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss 2.3 kg, and fevers. Laboratory testing revealed lactase deficiency and antibodies to outer membrane protein C OmpC IgA and bacterial flagellin CBir1. Colonoscopic examination revealed multiple shallow ulcers throughout the colon, rectum, and cecum. Pathological examination of biopsy specimens obtained on upper and lower endoscopy revealed evidence of acute gastritis, a granuloma in the duodenal bulb, moderately active ileitis, and chronic active colitis, findings consistent with Crohns disease. Omeprazole 20 mg twice daily, balsalazide disodium up to three 750-mg capsules twice daily, and azathioprine up to 50 mg daily were administered, and a modified specific carbohydrate diet without nuts was begun. Symptoms resolved, and 14 months before the current admission, a routine follow-up endoscopic examination and biopsy revealed no evidence of colitis. During the next 6 months, all medications were discontinued, and the patient remained asymptomatic while on a vegetarian diet. Approximately 5 weeks before the current admission concurrent with the start of the school year, nonbloody diarrhea developed, occurring three or four times daily. Three weeks before admission, intermittent crampy periumbilical pain developed, radiating to both lower quadrants. Four days before admission, the patient had increased abdominal pain and diarrhea, decreased appetite, weight loss, arthralgias, and fever, with a temperature as high as 38.9C. Two days before admission, she was seen in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. The patient rated the pain at 4 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. On examination, she was alert. While she was in a supine position, the blood pressure was 108/50 mm Hg and the pulse was 104 beats per minute, and while she was in a standing position, the blood pressure was 100/50 mm Hg and the pulse was 110 beats per minute. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds, and was tender in all four quadrants, without guarding or grimacing. Her stools were watery and foul-smelling, with no visible blood; testing for occult blood was positive. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, platelet count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, total protein, albumin, and globulin and results of liver- and renal-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Testing for Clostridium difficile toxin in the stool was positive; a stool culture for enteric pathogens was negative. Treatment with metronidazole 250 mg three times per day with meals was begun. However, the severity and frequency of pain and diarrhea increased; there were loose, liquid bowel movements four or five times per day. On the morning of admission, the patient had nonbilious, non-bloody emesis after taking metronidazole, and her stools became blood-tinged. She was admitted to this hospital. The patients family reported that she had decreased energy and intake of solid food, with a weight loss of 2.2 kg from a weight of 39 kg 2 months before admission since the onset of her current illness; she had lost 1 kg in the 2 days before admission. Nine months before admission, she had had a cough for 2 weeks; a chest radio-graph and results of complete pulmonary-function testing were normal, and the symptoms resolved. She was taking no other medications; immunizations were reportedly current. She was allergic to tree nuts anaphylaxis and peanuts; she had no known allergies to medications. She lived with her mother and three siblings and attended school. She was of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Her father and sister had Crohns disease, her father had arthritis, and her mother had asthma. On examination, the patient appeared to be in mild discomfort. The blood pressure was 112/68 mm Hg, the pulse 105 beats per minute, the temperature 36.0C, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, the oxygen saturation 100 while she was breathing ambient air, and the weight 36.8 kg. The abdomen was soft and non-distended, with hypoactive bowel sounds and mild tenderness in the periumbilical region and lower quadrants on palpation. The arms and legs were cool, without cyanosis, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and blood levels of iron, iron-binding capacity, and ferritin were normal, as were the results of the remaining metabolic laboratory tests. Additional test results are shown in Table 1. Metronidazole, esomeprazole magnesium, ondansetron, ketorolac tromethamine, and crys-talloid fluids were administered intravenously, vancomycin was given orally, and acetaminophen and lorazepam were administered as needed for pain and discomfort. In the afternoon of the second hospital day, the temperature rose to 39.1C. Dr. Michael T. Lu: In the evening of the second hospital day, computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed mild thickening and increased enhancement of the wall of the terminal ileum and ascending colon, a finding consistent with ileocolitis Fig. 1A. There were reactive lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant, with no evidence of an abscess or fistula. However, there were multiple subpleural lung nodules, measuring up to 13 mm in greatest dimension. These nodules had central hypoattenuation, a feature consistent with central necrosis Fig. 1B and 1C. On the fourth hospital day, CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed additional bilateral pulmonary nodules in a subpleural distribution, measuring up to 13 mm in greatest dimension. Several of the nodules had central hypoattenua-tion, and other nodules had indistinct margins. The thymus was normal, and there was no medi-astinal or hilar adenopathy. There was no pleural effusion. The differential diagnosis for these nodules is broad and includes inflammatory, infectious, and malignant entities. Integrated whole-body 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomographyCT FDG-PETCT revealed FDG avidity in many of the lung nodules, a finding indicating increased glucose metabolism Fig. 1D. No abnormal extrathoracic uptake was seen, which would have constituted evidence of a primary extrathoracic malignant tumor. Dr. Trivedi: Blood cultures were sterile, and urinalysis was normal. By the fourth hospital day, the abdominal pain and diarrhea had resolved. On the seventh hospital day, pulmonary-function tests showed a restrictive lung defect, with decreased carbon monoxide diffusing capacity Fig. 2. The patient was discharged on the seventh hospital day, while awaiting the results of additional diagnostic tests. Two weeks later, cough, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea on exertion developed. Repeat pulmonary-function tests showed a persistent restrictive defect and worsening carbon monoxide diffusing capacity Fig. 2. Dr. Lu: Four weeks after discharge, chest CT, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed that several of the nodules had increased in size while others had shrunk Fig. 1E. This waxing and waning pattern of growth suggests that the patient does not have a malignant process. Dr. Trivedi: Two days later, a diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Pulmonary Crohn’s disease. ", "prediction": "1. Flare-up of Crohn's disease: Given the patient's history of Crohn's disease and recent symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss, a flare-up is highly likely.\n2. Clostridium difficile infection: The positive testing for C. difficile toxin in the stool is consistent with this diagnosis, which is common in patients with a history of antibiotic use and inflammatory bowel disease.\n3. Secondary bacterial infection: The presence of fever and increased severity of symptoms could indicate a secondary bacterial infection, potentially exacerbating her underlying conditions.\n4. Pulmonary involvement of Crohn's disease: The subpleural lung nodules with central necrosis and hypoattenuation, along with the restrictive lung defect, suggest possible extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease.\n5. Tuberculosis: The presence of necrotizing lung nodules warrants consideration of tuberculosis, especially in an immunocompromised patient like one with Crohn's disease.\n6. Vasculitis: The waxing and waning pattern of the lung nodules could suggest an inflammatory vascular condition, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis.\n7. Sarcoidosis: The pulmonary nodules, though atypical, could be a manifestation of sarcoidosis, which often presents with respiratory symptoms and systemic involvement.\n8. Fungal infection: Endemic mycoses or opportunistic fungal infections could present with pulmonary nodules and systemic symptoms, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.\n9. Primary immunodeficiency: Her recurrent infections and family history of autoimmune conditions warrant consideration of an underlying immunodeficiency disorder.\n10. Malignant process: Despite some nodules shrinking, the persistence and worsening of others could still suggest a malignancy, although less likely than other diagnoses."}

The patient had a 10-year history of inguinal hernias larger on the left side than on the right side, with intermittent bulging that could be reduced without difficulty. Approximately 3 months before this presentation, pain associated with the bulging increased. During the 3 weeks before this presentation, the hernia on the left side enlarged, and the patient noted intermittent subjective fevers, with associated night sweats. The week before this presentation, he noted hard lumps next to the hernia that were tender on palpation. On the night before this presentation, the oral temperature was 38.1C. The next morning, he came to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The patient reported pain that he rated at 3 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain, with no chills, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. HIV infection had been diagnosed 8 years earlier, when he had a CD4 T-lymphocyte count of 66 per cubic millimeter; antiretroviral therapy ART was begun shortly thereafter. On the most recent testing, performed 2 months earlier, HIV RNA was undetectable assay range, 20 to 10,000,000 copies of nucleic acid per milliliter and the CD4 T-lymphocyte count was 250 per cubic millimeter reference range, 348 to 1456. He had had Kaposis sarcoma of the left calf and palate 8 years previously that resolved after treatment with bleomycin; in addition, he had had mol-luscum contagiosum, anal dysplasia, pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex infection which was diagnosed 9 years earlier and for which he received 18 months of treatment, pneumocystis pneumonia, thrush, preseptal cellulitis, and diarrhea caused by cryptosporidium. He also had had transiently elevated results of liver-function tests 3 years earlier that were thought to be caused by fatty liver disease or alcoholic liver disease. A test for toxoplasma IgG antibodies, which was performed shortly after he received the diagnosis of HIV infection, was negative, as were multiple rapid plasma reagin tests, which were performed between 8 and 5 years before this presentation; he had no known history of other sexually transmitted infections STIs. Medications included emtricitabine, tenofovir, and rilpivirine in combination. He was allergic to tri-methoprimsulfamethoxazole, which had caused hemolytic anemia. The patient was heterosexual and divorced and lived with his female partner, who was also HIV-positive and receiving ART. His most recent sexual activity with his partner had reportedly occurred 2 years earlier, with condom use, and he reported no other recent sexual activity. He had smoked cigarettes for 30 years and continued to do so, drank one or two alcoholic beverages daily, and did not use illicit drugs. He worked in the construction industry. He had a 22-year-old cat, for which he changed the litter; he did not recall any bites or scratches. He had traveled to Oklahoma approximately 6 months before this presentation. He was of white European ancestry. His father had coronary artery disease, and his mother had fibromyalgia; his siblings and adult children were healthy. On examination, the temperature was 36.8C, the blood pressure 155/79 mm Hg, the pulse 82 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while he was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft, without tenderness or distention. The patient had inguinal hernias larger on the left side than on the right side that were easily reducible, with minimal tenderness in the inguinal canal on scrotal invagination. There was bulky and slightly tender lymphadenopathy, including three large lymph nodes maximum diameter, 3 cm in the left inguinal region. The remainder of the examination was normal. The platelet count, red-cell indexes, and results of tests of renal function and coagulation were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, and lipids; other test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Dr. Tarik K. Alkasab: Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the left common iliac, left external iliac, and left inguinal regions Fig. 1, with associated stranding in the soft tissues of the anterior pelvic walls. Areas of hypodensity consistent with necrosis were seen in a left external iliac node, measuring 2.4 cm in the short-axis diameter, and in a partially visualized left inguinal node, measuring 2.2 cm in the short-axis diameter; small paraaortic and right inguinal nodes 1 cm in diameter were also seen. There were small, fat-containing bilateral inguinal hernias; the hernia on the left side was larger than the hernia on the right side 3.8 cm and 1.8 cm in greatest dimension, respectively. There was enlargement of the liver span, 22 cm, with the inferior tip reaching below the iliac crest, and borderline enlargement of the spleen, which measured 12.8 cm in length. Nonobstructing renal calculi were visualized on the left side; there was no evidence of bowel strangulation or obstruction. Dr. Singh: The next morning, additional laboratory test results were obtained Table 1, and a diagnostic test was performed.

Inguinal Lymphadenitis: The presence of bulky, tender lymphadenopathy in the left inguinal region, associated with fever and night sweats, suggests an infectious or inflammatory cause.\n2. Lymphoma: The multiple enlarged lymph nodes with necrosis seen on CT imaging, along with systemic symptoms, could indicate a hematologic malignancy such as lymphoma.\n3. Mycobacterial Infection (MAC): Given the patient's history of HIV and prior Mycobacterium avium complex infection, reactivation or a new mycobacterial infection is a possibility.\n4. Cat Scratch Disease: The patient's history of close contact with a cat and inguinal lymphadenopathy raises the possibility of Bartonella henselae infection.\n5.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Albert Yeh Medicine: A 25-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain, syncope, and hypotension. The patient had been well on the day of admission until, while lifting heavy boxes with a friend, he suddenly felt a warm feeling diffusely and had discomfort in his epigastrium and right upper quadrant that radiated throughout his abdomen, followed by tingling in his mouth, tongue, arms, and legs. Within the next few minutes, his vision blurred and darkened. He felt faint and lay down on the sidewalk. Within 5 minutes after the onset of symptoms, nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting occurred, and he lost consciousness. His friend held him in a sitting position and noticed he was shaking. Emergency medical services were called. On examination by emergency medical services personnel, the patient was lying on the sidewalk, unresponsive to verbal or painful stimuli, and had diaphoresis, shallow breathing, a clenched jaw, and urinary incontinence. A nasopharyngeal airway was placed, high-flow oxygen was administered, and ventilation with a bag-valve mask was performed at a rate of 10 breaths per minute. The Glasgow Coma Scale score was 3 on a scale of 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating reduced levels of consciousness. The blood pressure was 53/27 mm Hg, and the pulse 90 beats per minute. A cardiac monitor recorded normal sinus rhythm. A bolus of normal saline was rapidly infused. Within 3 minutes, the pulse rose to 118 beats per minute, the blood pressure rose to 60/28 mm Hg, and spontaneous respirations resumed; high-flow oxygen was administered through a nonrebreather face mask. The level of capillary blood glucose was 73 mg per deciliter 4.05 mmol per liter. Naloxone was administered intravenously, without improvement. During transport to this hospital by ambulance, the patient opened his eyes in response to verbal stimuli. The blood pressure transiently rose to 102/73 mm Hg and then fell to 83/31 mm Hg, the pulse was 90 beats per minute, the respiratory rate was 17 to 21 breaths per minute, and the Glasgow Coma Scale score rose to 9. On arrival in the emergency department, approximately 30 minutes after the onset of symptoms, the patient was initially difficult to arouse, but his condition rapidly improved and then he was alert and responsive. He reported abdominal pain, which he rated at 2 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The patient had no recollection of the events immediately leading to his presentation and had had no headache, chest pain, palpitations, or seizure activity preceding his symptoms. He reported occasional pruritus when showering. He had had an appendectomy in the past, took no medications, and had no known allergies. The patient was born in Romania and had come to the United States 6 years before presentation to attend school. He returned annually to Romania to visit family. He noted that he had been exposed to stray dogs while he was in Romania. He had also traveled to India and China 6 and 7 years earlier, respectively. He did not drink alcohol, smoke, or use illicit drugs. His father had had cardiovascular disease and had died of a myocardial infarction at 59 years of age; there was no family history of a seizure disorder or cancer. On examination, the patient was fully oriented. The blood pressure was 98/48 mm Hg, the pulse 128 beats per minute, the temperature 36.0C, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute unlabored, and the oxygen saturation 99 while he was breathing oxygen through a face mask at a rate of 15 liters per minute and 98 after he had been rapidly weaned from oxygen supplementation and was breathing ambient air. The pupils were equal in diameter, round, and reactive to light. The lungs were clear, and the heart sounds had a rapid, regular rhythm and were otherwise normal. The chest was mildly tender on percussion of the left side. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft and tender on palpation of the epigastric region and of the right side of the abdomen, with voluntary guarding. The skin was diffusely flushed, with a warm, blanching rash on his neck, chest, and abdomen; his fingers and feet were cool, without edema or urticaria. The remainder of the examination was normal. The Glasgow Coma Scale score was initially 14 and rose to 15, and the remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. Cardiac monitoring revealed sinus tachycardia, without ectopy. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 127 beats per minute, with right atrial enlargement and a nonspecific ST-segment abnormality. The platelet count was normal, as were blood levels of alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, albumin, globulin, tropo-nin T, and lipase and results of d-dimer and renal-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. An abdominal ultrasound examination, performed at the bedside, showed no free fluid in the right or left upper quadrant or in the peri-cardial or retrovesicular space; a hypoechoic abnormality with internal echoes was present in the liver. During the first hour after arrival, the patient became tremulous and nauseated. Normal saline and ondansetron were administered intravenously. A chest radiograph was normal, with no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. During the next hour, cyanosis of the lips and nail beds and swelling of the hands occurred; abdominal erythema and blanching of the fingers and feet persisted. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Additional test results are shown in Table 1. During the first 4 hours in the emergency department, 2 liters of normal saline were infused. The blood pressure was 96/52 mm Hg, the pulse 77 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. A diagnostic test was performed.

Anaphylaxis: The acute onset of symptoms including hypotension, flushing, rash, and abdominal pain, along with a history of possible allergen exposure, suggests a severe allergic reaction.\n2. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's abrupt onset of nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and rapid improvement with fluid resuscitation could indicate a significant fluid loss or dehydration.\n3. Adrenal insufficiency: The hypotension, abdominal pain, and history of syncope could be related to an adrenal crisis, possibly exacerbated by physical stress.\n4. Vasovagal syncope: The combination of lifting heavy boxes and a sudden warm feeling followed by fainting is consistent with a common fainting response caused by a drop in heart rate and blood pressure.\n5. Sepsis: The initial presentation of hypotension, tachycardia, flushed skin, and altered mental status is concerning for a severe infection leading to sepsis.\n6. Cardiac arrhythmia: Although no ectopy was found on ECG, the history of a myocardial infarction in the patient's father and initial loss of consciousness requires consideration of an intermittent arrhythmia.\n7. Hepatic abscess: The abdominal ultrasound finding of a hypoechoic abnormality in the liver with the clinical signs of systemic illness raises suspicion for a liver abscess.\n8. Hypoglycemia: Despite an initial blood glucose level within normal limits, the symptoms of syncope and altered mental state could relate to a transient hypoglycemic event.\n9. Acute gastrointestinal bleed: Although no signs of hemorrhage were noted, the abdominal pain, hypotension, and syncope warrant consideration of an occult gastrointestinal bleed.\n10. Hypothyroidism: Unexplained hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and symptoms such as cool extremities and cyanosis could be caused by severe hypothyroidism or myxedema coma."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Kathy Chuang Neurology: A 60-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital in midwinter because of abdominal pain, dyspnea, and diplopia. The patient had a history of asthma and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She had been well until the day before admission, when she noticed that her voice seemed hoarse and thick with increased salivation. That afternoon, nausea, retching, and worsening abdominal pain developed, with associated shortness of breath similar to that caused by her asthma. That evening, she was taken by ambulance to another hospital. On arrival in the emergency department, the patient reported sharp, constant, diffuse abdominal pain that she rated at 9 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain, as well as throat tightness and dysphagia. On examination, she was alert, uncomfortable, and ill-appearing. The temperature was 36.8C, the blood pressure 138/79 mm Hg, the pulse 117 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while she was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, with soft bowel sounds; there was pain on palpation in the left upper and both lower quadrants. The remainder of the general and neurologic examinations was reportedly normal. The platelet count was normal, as were blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, and lipase and results of coagulation and liver- and renal-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.020, a pH of 5.0, 1 ketones, and trace leukocyte esterase and hemoglobin by dipstick, as well as bacteria, mucus, and 1 to 4 white cells and 1 to 3 red cells per high-power field. A chest radiograph showed linear opacities at the lung bases that were consistent with subsegmental atelectasis. A diagnosis of possible allergic reaction was made; diphenhydramine hydrochloride, ondansetron, morphine sulfate, famotidine, methylprednisolone, normal saline, and epinephrine were administered. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 106 beats per minute, with nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes. Radiographs of the soft tissue of the neck and the cervical spine showed multilevel degenerative disk and facet-joint disease. Oxygen supplementation was administered by means of a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation rose to 100. An oral anticholinergic and antispasmodic solution atropine sulfate, hy-oscyamine, phenobarbital, scopolamine hydrobro-mide, and lidocaine and an oral antacid solution aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone were administered. Within minutes, the patient was reportedly unable to drink the second half of the mixture. Computed tomography CT of the head, neck, spine, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed findings suggestive of small-bowel obstruction. A nasogastric tube was placed, and 250 ml of liquid removed. The patient reported horizontal diplopia, which had been developing during the previous 2 hours, and soon after had increasing difficulty speaking. She was transferred to this hospital by ambulance, arriving at 6:23 a.m., approximately 9 hours after presentation to the other hospital. On arrival, the patient, who was right-handed, communicated primarily by writing. She reported increasing shortness of breath and a feeling of suffocation. The previous week, she had had an upper respiratory infection with a cough but no fever. She had a history of hyperlipidemia, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications at home were atorvastatin, dexlansoprazole, montelukast, and fluticasonesalmeterol. She was allergic to sulfa drugs and levofloxacin. She drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. She lived with her husband, worked in an office, and had not recently traveled. Her family history included hypertension, heart disease, and colon cancer; her husband was well. On the initial examination, performed at 6:40 a.m., the patient was alert and oriented. The blood pressure was 125/77 mm Hg, the pulse 122 beats per minute, the temperature 36.8C, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while she was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft, mildly distended, and nontender. On neurologic examination, the pupils were equal and reactive to light; the extra-ocular-muscle movement was intact, without nys-tagmus. There was binocular diplopia at far distances. The patient was unable to phonate clearly or protrude the tongue; other cranial-nerve functions, motor function, and peripheral sensation were intact. At 7 a.m., the patient was unable to elevate the palate, phonation was worse, and there was weakness on abduction of the right eye. The platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, urinalysis, and results of coagulation and renal- and liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of magnesium, lactic acid, total protein, albumin, globulin, amylase, lipase, IgA, C-reactive protein, thyrotropin, and glycated hemoglobin; other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at rate of 123 beats per minute. Surgical and neurologic consultations were requested. On a repeat examination, performed by neurol-ogy consultants at 8:30 a.m., there was bilateral ptosis and weakness on eye abduction and elevation. Reflexes were normal and symmetric throughout. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, showed low-lying cerebellar tonsils with crowding of the foramen magnum, without evidence of intracra-nial hemorrhage, infarct, or mass lesion. Ipratropium was administered by nebulizer. During the next 2 hours, intermittent stridor and worsening weakness of the face, palate, and tongue developed, and the dyspnea worsened. Three hours after arrival, fiberoptic nasopharyn-goscopy revealed bilateral vocal-cord paralysis, with the cords fixed at 1 to 2 mm of opposition, without edema. Supplemental oxygen was administered, and the trachea was intubated for airway protection. The patient was admitted to the neurology intensive care unit. On examination, she was alert and able to follow commands promptly. There was bilateral complete ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, and anisocoria; the left pupil was oval-shaped, with a vertical long axis of 8 mm, and was partially reactive in the upper half, and the right pupil was 6 mm in diameter and reactive to 4 mm. There was mild proximal weakness of the arms and legs with a Medical Research Council grade of 4 on a scale of 0 paralysis to 5 normal strength; distal strength was preserved. Reflexes were brisk throughout, and both plantar reflexes were flexor. A diagnostic test was performed.

Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy: Progressive motor and bulbar weakness following an infection fits the clinical picture consistent with this variant of Guillain-Barré Syndrome.\n7. Thyrotoxic Periodic Paralysis: Given the tachycardia and prior history of hyperthyroidism, an acute metabolic disorder resulting in sudden muscle weakness should be ruled out.\n8. Muscular Dystrophy: While less likely due to the acute onset, some forms of dystrophy could present with such symptoms at this age and necessitate consideration.\n9. Multiple Sclerosis: Despite the patient’s age, the possibility of multiple sclerosis should be considered given the neurological findings, even though the presentation is atypical.\n10.

On the afternoon of admission, the patient was found leaning up against a wall, unresponsive. With him was a half-filled bottle of cloudy liquid with possible pill fragments, as well as bottles of prescription medications that had been filled earlier that day, including trazodone 1 of 28 pills remaining and risperidone, buspirone, and loratadine each with all pills present. Emergency medical services were called. On examination of the patient in the field, the Glasgow Coma Scale GCS score was 4 on a scale of 3 to 15 with lower scores indicating a lower level of consciousness; he opened his eyes in response to painful stimuli but did not move or make any sounds. The blood pressure was 108/67 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute and regular, the respiratory rate 10 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97. The skin was pink, warm, and dry, and the pupils were 3 mm in diameter, round, and reactive to light; the remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. The capillary blood glucose level was 108 mg per deciliter. Oxygen at a rate of 15 liters per minute, delivered by means of a nonrebreather face mask and naloxone were administered, without improvement in mental status. An electrocardiogram ECG was normal. He was transported to this hospital by ambulance. The patients history, which was obtained from his medical records, included drug use cocaine, opiates, and benzodiazepines, anxiety, depression with multiple suicide attempts, hepatitis C virus infection, and possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD. Current medications other than those found with him on presentation were unknown. He had no known allergies. He smoked cigarettes and had been homeless and incarcerated in the past. He was divorced and had adult children; his current living circumstances were not known. On examination in the emergency department, the patient could move his arms and legs and open his eyes in response to painful stimuli, but he could not follow commands or speak; the GCS score was 8. The blood pressure was 108/67 mm Hg, the pulse 88 beats per minute, the temperature 36.2C, the respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while he was breathing ambient air. Both pupils measured 3 mm in diameter and were briskly reactive to 2 mm when exposed to bright light. The lungs were clear with normal respiratory effort, the breath sounds were diminished at the bases, the heart sounds were normal, and the abdomen was soft. Within the first 45 minutes after his arrival at the hospital, the patient became increasingly agitated and combative, resisting all medical interventions; physical restraints were applied. An ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 86 beats per minute, with evidence of biatrial enlargement and with a PR interval of 128 msec, a QRS interval of 104 msec, a QT interval of 386 msec, and a corrected QT QTc interval of 461 msec. A complete blood count and blood levels of calcium and phosphorus were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Analysis of urine obtained by means of straight catheterization revealed a pH of 5.5 and a specific gravity of 1.008; dipstick testing was normal. Screening of a blood specimen for toxins revealed trazodone 1826 g per liter; therapeutic range, 800 to 1600, meta-chlorophenylpi-perazine MCPP, and venlafaxine; screening of a urine specimen was negative. The poison control center advised monitoring cardiac intervals with serial ECG. Approximately 4 hours after arrival, a repeat ECG showed a QTc interval of 501 msec. Shortly thereafter, the patient vomited. Magnesium was administered. On admission, the patient had intermittent somnolence alternating with periods of increasing agitation and thrashing limbs, but he remained nonverbal and unable to follow commands. Low-dose lorazepam for extreme agitation and normal saline were administered. Increasing lower abdominal fullness developed that was consistent with bladder distention and urinary retention; an indwelling urinary catheter was placed, with improvement. On repeat blood testing 7.5 hours after presentation, blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, and tro-ponin T were normal, as were results of liver-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. The blood pressure was 109/64 mm Hg, and the pulse 105 beats per minute; the temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were normal. Ten hours after presentation, blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, and creatine kinase were normal; additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic test was performed.

Carter Dermatology: A 69-year-old woman was seen in the cutaneous-lymphoma outpatient clinic of this hospital because of recurrent skin lesions, which had begun appearing approximately 2 months after she completed chemotherapy for anaplastic large-cell lymphoma ALCL that was negative for the gene anaplastic lymphoma kinase ALK. The patient had been well until approximately 9 months before this evaluation, when small, slightly pruritic papules developed on her left breast, chest, and back. Eight months before this evaluation, she was seen by a dermatologist. A diagnosis of squamous-cell carcinoma was considered, and a biopsy of a lesion on the left breast was performed at a hospital in another state. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimen reportedly revealed evidence of a CD30 lymphoproliferative disorder that was thought to be consistent with ALK-negative ALCL. The patient was referred to an oncologist. She reported no weight loss, fevers, night sweats, chills, fatigue, or shortness of breath. Dr. Shaunagh McDermott: Combined positron-emission tomography and computed tomography PET-CT revealed enlarged right common iliac, external iliac, and inguinal lymph nodes. The largest node, an inguinal node that was 4.1 cm by 2.4 cm in greatest dimension Fig. 1A, showed increased 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose FDG avidity Fig. 1B. Dr. Carter: Chemotherapy, consisting of six cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxoru-bicin, vincristine, and prednisone, was administered. After the fourth cycle, the skin lesions had resolved. Five weeks before this evaluation, approximately 2 months after the completion of chemotherapy, new lesions appeared on the patients back and right flank. A complete blood count was reportedly normal. Biopsies of the new lesions were performed; pathological examination of the biopsy specimens reportedly revealed evidence of recurrent ALCL. Dr. McDermott: On follow-up imaging studies, performed 3 weeks before this evaluation, the inguinal lymph nodes had decreased in size; the largest node was now 2.0 cm by 0.6 cm in greatest dimension Fig. 1C and no longer showed increased FDG avidity. There was also skin thickening in the left lateral thigh (Figure 1D), which showed increased FDG avidity (Figure 1E). Dr. Carter: Two additional skin lesions developed on the patient’s left shoulder. Topical triamcinolone was administered, with partial improvement. She came to this hospital for a second opinion. The patient reported that similar skin lesions had developed in the past and resolved without treatment after approximately 1 month. She reported weight loss of 9 kg after chemotherapy and rated her fatigue level at 4 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe fatigue. She had hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, arthritis, obesity, and a history of cutaneous squamous-cell and basal-cell carcinomas, numerous cysts, acneiform lesions, and actinic keratoses. Medications included benazepril, aspirin, pravastatin, gemfibrozil, levothyroxine sodium, diclofenac, ascorbic acid, a multivitamin, omeprazole, and n−3 fish oil. She had no known allergies. She was divorced, lived alone in the southeastern United States, and was employed. She had an 80-pack-year history of smoking and had stopped smoking 2 years before this evaluation; she drank two alcoholic beverages daily. Her mother had died of breast cancer, her sister had thyroid cancer, her brother had nonmelanoma skin cancer, and her son was healthy. On examination, the vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. There was a firm, pink papule (4 mm in diameter) on the left posterior shoulder (Figure 2), a flesh-colored papule with a scarlike quality (2 to 3 mm in diameter) on the left anterior shoulder, numerous atrophic scars and cysts on the trunk and thighs, healing biopsy sites on the back, and a healing linear incision with intact sutures on the central chest.

Goldstein Pediatrics: A 16-year-old boy was seen in the adolescent medicine outpatient clinic of this hospital in late spring because of coughing spells. The patient had been well until approximately 3 weeks before the current presentation, when cough and nasal congestion developed and persisted, without fever or chills. He took fexofenadine hydrochloride, without improvement. Three days before the current presentation, he awoke at night with a severe coughing spell, with associated post-tussive emesis and trouble breathing. His parents took him to the emergency department of another hospital. On examination, he appeared to be in no distress; the temperature was 37.0C, the blood pressure 152/87 mm Hg, the pulse 107 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while he was breathing ambient air. The mucosa of the posterior oropharynx had a cobblestone appearance and the uvula was midline; there was no tonsillar edema or exudate. Nasal congestion, boggy nasal mucosa, and serous effusions behind both tympanic membranes were evident. The lungs were clear on auscultation, and the remainder of the examination was normal. A diagnosis of allergic rhinitis with the upper-airway cough syndrome postnasal drip was made, and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and benzonatate 200 mg three times daily were prescribed. The next day, the patient continued to cough but was able to attend school. That night, he awoke from sleep with an episode of severe coughing that lasted approximately 10 minutes and was associated with two episodes of vomiting. He returned to the emergency department of the other hospital. He reported no chest pain, fevers, night sweats, or weight loss. On examination, he appeared to be well and was not coughing; the temperature was 36.8C, the blood pressure 151/87 mm Hg, the pulse 93 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while he was breathing ambient air. Mild nasal congestion and erythema of the posterior pharynx were present, and the remainder of the examination was normal. A chest radiograph was reportedly normal. A presumptive diagnosis of bronchospasm was made. A dose of dexamethasone was administered for treatment of possible croup, and an albuterol inhaler was prescribed. The patient was advised to follow up with his pediatrician. During the next 2 days a weekend, the cough persisted, without paroxysms; the night before the current presentation, the patient had two episodes of severe coughing, followed by inspirations with choking sounds. On the day of the current presentation, he attended school. His parents scheduled an appointment with his pediatrician at an outpatient clinic of this hospital for later that day. The patient reported epistaxis during his coughing episodes; his parents reported that they thought he was choking during the episodes. He did not have headaches, hearing problems, chest pain, shortness of breath other than with coughing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation. He had a history of elevated systolic blood pressure and a body-mass index in the 94th percentile. He took no regular medications. He was fully immunized with childhood vaccines, including five doses of diphtheriatetanusacellular pertussis DTaP vaccine, four doses of Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine, three doses of hepatitis B vaccine, and two doses of measlesmumpsrubella vaccine in infancy and early childhood, as well as two doses of meningococcal vaccine at 11 and 16 years of age, one dose of tetanus toxoidreduced diphtheria toxoidacellular pertussis, adsorbed Tdap vaccine at 11 years of age, and one dose of human papillomavirus vaccine at 16 years of age; there was no documentation of pneumococcal or influenza vaccinations. He had no known allergies to medications. He lived with his parents and one younger sibling and attended high school. He occasionally drank alcohol and smoked cigarettes and was not sexually active. His father had hypertension; his mother, who was receiving chemotherapy for cancer, had a dry, nonproductive cough of approximately 4 weeks duration, which had begun before the onset of the patients symptoms. On examination, the patient appeared to be well. The blood pressure was 140/79 mm Hg in the right arm and 119/72 mm Hg in the left arm, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the temperature 36.5C, and the oxygen saturation 99 while he was breathing ambient air. Examination of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds on the right side, and the remainder of the examination was normal. No coughing was observed during a 40-minute period. The white-cell count was 8200 per cubic millimeter reference range, 4500 to 13,000, with 46.1 neutrophils reference range, 40 to 62, 42.6 lymphocytes reference range, 27 to 40, 8.9 monocytes reference range, 4 to 11, 1.6 eosinophils reference range, 0 to 8, and 0.6 basophils reference range, 0 to 3; the hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and platelet count were normal, as was a chest radiograph. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Infection with Bordetella pertussis. ", "prediction": "1. Pertussis (Whooping Cough): Given the history of severe coughing spells with post-tussive emesis and inspiratory whoop, pertussis is a leading consideration despite vaccination, as immunity can wane over time.\n2. Acute Bronchitis: Persistent cough and nasal congestion without fever or chills could indicate acute bronchitis, supported by the clear lung auscultation and symptoms' duration.\n3. Asthma: The nighttime coughing episodes, post-tussive emesis, and family history of respiratory issues are suggestive of asthma, particularly given the improvement with dexamethasone and albuterol.\n4. Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI): The presenting symptoms of nasal congestion and cobblestone appearance of the posterior oropharynx are consistent with a viral URTI.\n5. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The episodes of coughing at night and post-tussive vomiting might be related to GERD, which can exacerbate cough especially when lying down.\n6. Habit Cough Syndrome: The history of a persistent cough without identifiable organic cause and normal radiographic findings could suggest a psychogenic or habit cough.\n7. Allergic Rhinitis: The cobblestone appearance of the posterior oropharynx and nasal congestion are indicative of allergic rhinitis, which can contribute to chronic cough due to postnasal drip.\n8. Sinusitis: Persistent nasal congestion, boggy nasal mucosa, and postnasal drip could be secondary to sinusitis, especially with the chronicity of symptoms.\n9. Foreign Body Aspiration: The sudden onset of coughing and decreased breath sounds on one side raise the possibility of a foreign body in the airway despite normal radiographs.\n10. Mycoplasma Pneumonia: Atypical pathogens like Mycoplasma pneumoniae can cause prolonged cough, and a normal chest radiograph does not exclude this diagnosis."}

Keenan Medicine: A 25-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of oral ulcers, rash, and odynophagia. The patient had been well until approximately 18 days before this admission, when mild sinus congestion developed. Sixteen days before this admission, repair of a labral tear of the right hip and femoroacetabular impingement was performed, after which naproxen was administered. Approximately 8 days before this admission, pharyngitis, odynophagia, fevers, chills, and night sweats occurred. Three days later 5 days before this admission, the patient was seen by his physician at an outpatient practice. On examination, the tonsils were enlarged and erythematous, with crypt abscesses and anterior cervical lymphadenopathy; the remainder of the examination was normal. Amoxicillin was administered. The next day, the patients temperature rose to 38.6C. The following day 3 days before this admission, he returned to his physicians office. The temperature was normal, and the remainder of the examination was unchanged. The patient continued to take amoxicillin; however, fevers recurred. The following day 2 days before this admission, he returned to his physicians office again. There was cervical lymphadenopathy and pustular discharge on the tonsils but no evidence of periton-sillar abscess. Testing for heterophile antibodies was negative; results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Amoxicillin clavulanate was administered, and he returned home. Oral lesions, pain on swallowing, and scattered pustules on his face and trunk developed; the lesions progressed to involve his arms and legs. One day before this admission, the patient was seen by his physician for a fourth time. On examination, he appeared ill and lethargic; the temperature was 38.7C, and there was a pustular rash on the face and torso. He was admitted to another hospital. The patient reported pain when swallowing that he rated at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. Medications on admission were amoxicil-linclavulanate, acetaminophenoxycodone, ibuprofen, and, at bedtime, melatonin. The temperature was 38.8C, the blood pressure 147/82 mm Hg, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The pharynx was erythematous, and the tonsils were erythematous and enlarged with crypt abscesses and a patchy exudate. There was bilateral anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. There was a pustule on the lower lip, as well as pustules with crusted centers and surrounding erythematous wheals involving the face, torso, arms, and legs. The lesions were dime-sized approximately 18 mm in diameter or smaller. The remainder of the examination was normal. Rapid testing of a pharyngeal specimen for streptococcal infection was negative, as was a monospot test for heterophile antibodies; the creatinine level and results of liver-function tests were normal. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Ampicil-linsulbactam, hydromorphone, viscous lidocaine, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and morphine were administered. Blood cultures remained sterile. During the first day, the temperature rose to 39.0C. The day after admission to the other hos-pital, examination by an infectious-disease consultant revealed severe exudative pharyngitis and ulcers mostly involving the upper and lower lips and anterior hard palate near the gumline. Pustular lesions mostly involved the face and back, although some were palpable on the right thigh; the palms and soles were not involved. At the request of the patients family, he was transferred to this hospital later that day. The patient reported fevers, headaches, mild sinus congestion, myalgias in both thighs and calves, tender nodules on his shins, perianal pru-ritus, constipation that had lasted for 3 days, and weight loss of approximately 3.5 kg during this illness. He had a history of acne that differed from his current facial lesions, as well as cold sores and genital erosions that resolved spontaneously and dysphagia and occasional hematemesis for which esophagogastroduodenoscopic examina-tions performed 15 months and 4 months earlier reportedly revealed a lower esophageal ring, esophageal erosions, and possible eosinophilic esophagitis. He had had varicella infection chickenpox as a child and a previous chlamydia infection. Hydrocodone reportedly caused vomiting. He lived with roommates, owned two dogs, and worked in an office; a coworker had recently had an upper respiratory tract infection. He drank alcohol and smoked marijuana. He had been sexually active with multiple partners in the past year, sometimes with unprotected intercourse. He had traveled to Hawaii many months earlier. His father had hypertension and ulcerative colitis, and his mother had diverticulitis. He was of Native American and western European ancestry. On examination, the temperature was 37.1C, the blood pressure 144/87 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. There were erythematous ulcers on the lips and hard palate, and the tonsils had white erosions on a red base. There was submandibular, cervical, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. There were scattered pink pap-ules and plaques involving the trunk, thighs, and buttocks and multiple raised, erythematous nodules on both shins that were tender on palpation and had no underlying fluctuance. The patient had an ulcer on the left side of the glans penis 2 to 3 mm in diameter, similar ulcers on the scrotum, and a left perirectal ulcer 1 cm in diameter with surrounding erythema. There were no bullae, target lesions, or lesions on the palms or soles. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase were normal, as were results of renal- and liver-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Blood samples were obtained for culture. Urinalysis and a chest radiograph were normal. An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm and nonspecific T-wave abnormalities.

The patient had been well until 2 years before this presentation, when anemia was noted on routine examination at another hospital. During the next 7 months, endoscopic and colonoscopic screening examinations were negative. Pathological examination of a bone marrowbiopsy specimen and aspirate revealed 30 plasma cells; flow-cytometric studies revealed an IgG lambda M component. A diagnosis of multiple myeloma was made. Skeletal radiographs reportedly revealed multiple lytic lesions. Lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone were administered, followed by cyclophosphamide. Nine months before this presentation, the patient was admitted to this hospital; melphalan hydrochloride was administered, and autologous stem-cell transplantation was performed. Results of follow-up studies were consistent with complete remission. Three months before this presentation, the patient was seen by an orthopedist at this hospital for evaluation of low-back pain of 1 years duration. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the lumbar spine, performed after the administration of intravenous gadolinium, revealed multilevel degenerative changes, multiple enhancing lesions in the lumbar spine and left iliac bone, and compression fractures of the first and second lumbar vertebrae, findings consistent with the history of multiple myeloma. Two months before this presentation, swelling and pain in the hands occurred, followed by pedal edema, tightening of the skin of the hands and feet, and diffuse hyperpigmentation on the trunk, arms, and legs. Maintenance therapy with lenalido-mide was begun, but it was stopped during the first cycle because of worsening symptoms. Diffuse joint pain occurred and hyperpigmentation increased. One month before this presentation, on evaluation in the outpatient cancer center of this hospital, the red-cell indexes and results of liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, thyrotropin, iron, iron-binding capacity, ferritin, and folate; other test results are shown in Table 1. Total urine protein was 90 mg per liter reference range, 0 to 135. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a fat pad was performed, and pathological examination of the specimen revealed no evidence of malignant cells or amyloid. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed trace mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid insufficiency, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 64 and showed that the ascending aorta was 41 mm in diameter reference diameter, 36 mm; there was no evidence of amyloid or pericardial effusion. Urinalysis was normal. The patient was referred to the rheuma-tology clinic of this hospital. On presentation, the patient rated the joint pain at 6 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He had hyperlipidemia, hypertension, low-back pain, and gastroesophageal reflux disease; he had undergone colonic polyp-ectomies and had a history of prostate cancer for which radical prostatectomy was performed 11 years earlier. Medications included acyclovir, ro-suvastatin, and omeprazole. Allopurinol caused a rash. He lived with his wife and worked in an office. He had stopped smoking 20 years earlier, drank alcohol in moderation, and did not use illicit drugs. His mother and maternal uncle had rheumatoid arthritis. On examination, the blood pressure was 112/63 mm Hg and the pulse 100 beats per minute; the temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were normal. A systolic murmur, grade 26, was heard at the right and left upper sternal borders. There was swelling and tenderness in the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interpha-langeal joints bilaterally and swelling below the knees to the toes, without erythema or warmth. The range of motion was decreased in the meta-carpophalangeal and ankle joints. The skin on the metacarpophalangeal joints and legs below the knees to the toes was hyperpigmented. The blood level of C-reactive protein was 54.7 mg per liter reference value, 8.0; testing for antibodies to Ro SSA, La SSB, Sm, RNP, Jo-1, Scl-70 topoi-somerase I, and cyclic citrullinated peptide was negative, and the level of creatine kinase was normal. A tapering course of prednisone was administered. Five weeks later, after returning from a vacation in Aruba, the patient was seen for follow-up appointments at the hematology clinic of the other hospital and the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. He reported severe fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, and weight loss of approximately 3.5 kg. He rated the joint pain at 2 out of 10, but substantial stiffness persisted while he was taking prednisone. On examination, the blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg, the pulse 100 to 111 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while he was breathing ambient air; the temperature was normal. The metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints remained swollen but were less tender, and the wrists were slightly full. There was 1 pitting edema below the knees; the skin was deeply tanned and firm in a manner that was out of proportion to the degree of pitting edema. Test results are shown in Table 1. The stool was dark brown and positive 3 for blood. The administration of omeprazole was increased to twice daily, and an endoscopic examination was scheduled. One week later six weeks after this presentation, the patient was admitted to the other hospital because of worsening anemia Table 1. The hematocrit rose to 27.9 after leukocyte-reduced red cells were transfused. Endoscopy revealed severe acute gastritis with marked erythema and friability. He was discharged on the third day. During the next 2 months, melena and anemia persisted. Colonoscopy at the other hospital revealed a benign polyp, 5 mm in diameter, which was excised. Multiple units of red cells were transfused, and intravenous immune globulin IVIG was administered monthly, with some improvement in joint pain and stiffness. Skin tightness persisted, and a skin biopsy was performed. Dr. Rosalynn M. Nazarian: Examination of histo-logic sections of a punch-biopsy specimen from the dorsum of the left hand revealed a fibrosing dermopathy, with interstitial mucin deposition and collagen expansion of the dermis extending to the subcutaneous tissue Fig. 1A. The epidermis appeared normal. Adnexal atrophy with loss of surrounding fat was identified. A sparse lym-phoplasmacytic infiltrate was present at the junction of the dermis and the subcutaneous fat Fig. 1B. There were areas of marked fibroblast hypocellularity in the middle and deep reticular dermis, with diffuse loss of CD34 expression in dermal spindle cells Fig. 1C. A colloidal iron stain revealed finely granular mucin deposits interspersed between dermal collagen bundles Fig. 1D. An elastic-tissue stain revealed preservation of dermal elastic fibers, with straightening and parallel arrangement Fig. 1E. Dr. Rastalsky: Three months after this presen-tation, prednisone was administered for persistent stiffness. The patient reported extreme fatigue and increasing dyspnea on exertion during the preceding 3 months. Results of tests performed at the other hospital are shown in Table 1. Chest imaging was performed because of the worsening shortness of breath. Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: Computed tomography CT of the chest revealed reticulation in the sub-pleural region at the lung bases and bronchiolec-tasis Fig. 2A. There was no evidence of pulmonary edema. These findings were suggestive of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. Soft-tissue windows showed a small pleural effusion on the right side and minimal dilatation of the main pulmonary artery that could be correlated with pulmonary hypertension Fig. 2B. The esophagus was diffusely dilated and contained contrast material throughout. A representative sagittal image showed generalized osteopenia, multiple lytic lesions throughout the spine and ribs, and multiple healed fractures, including one in the sternum Fig. 2C. These skeletal findings were consistent with the history of multiple myeloma. Dr. Rastalsky: The patient was admitted to this hospital 3.5 months after this presentation. On examination, there were bilateral bronchial breath sounds, crackles at the base of the left lung, extensive hardening of the skin from the hands to the elbows and from the toes to above the knees, and deep bronze discoloration on the trunk, arms, and legs. Joint motion was limited by skin thickening. Test results are shown in Table 1. An endoscopic examination was performed. Dr. Nazarian: During the endoscopy, a gastric-biopsy specimen was obtained from the antrum; examination of the specimen revealed expansion of the lamina propria and prominent fibromus-cular hyperplasia. Other areas showed ectatic mu-cosal capillaries with occasional fibrin thrombi Fig. 3. This constellation of findings was consistent with gastric antral vascular ectasia which is also referred to as watermelon stomach because the condition is characterized by the parallel arrangement of longitudinal folds containing dilated vessels that converge at the pylorus, and this arrangement resembles the stripes on a watermelon. Dr. Rastalsky: IVIG and bortezomib were administered. The patient was discharged on the fourth day. Five days later, the patient reported increased discomfort and inability to bend his joints and was using a wheelchair. Test results are shown in Table 1. During the next 4 days, confusion developed and he had difficulty with word-finding. Oral intake was poor. Four months after this presentation, he was brought to the emergency department of this hospital; on examination, he was alert, oriented to person only, and had difficulty with word-finding and verbal expression. The blood pressure was 98/63 mm Hg, and there was periorbital and facial edema; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Test results are shown in Table 1. The peripheral-blood smear showed 2 to 4 schistocytes per high-power field. Urinalysis showed 2 albumin by dipstick, a specific gravity of 1.015, and a pH of 6.0; the urinary sediment was packed with pigmented, coarsely granular casts and had 10 nondysmorphic erythrocytes per high-power field and no cellular casts. The ratio of total spot-urine protein to creatinine was 4.0. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, was negative. The patient was readmitted to this hospital. A diagnostic test result was received.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Scleroderma. ", "prediction": "1. Multiple Myeloma Progression: Given his history and persistent symptoms, worsening myeloma with organ involvement is highly likely.\n2. Systemic Sclerosis: The presence of skin thickening, joint pain, and hyperpigmentation is suggestive of systemic sclerosis, particularly with fibrosing dermopathy on biopsy.\n3. Lenalidomide-Induced Skin Reaction: The worsening of symptoms after starting lenalidomide could indicate a drug-related skin reaction.\n4. Amyloidosis: Although fat pad biopsy was negative, the systemic symptoms and organ involvement make amyloidosis a possible cause.\n5. Scleromyxedema: This rare condition involving skin thickening, mucin deposition, and fibroblast changes matches the biopsy findings and clinical picture.\n6. Non-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia: Chest CT findings and progressive dyspnea raise the likelihood of interstitial lung disease, especially NSIP.\n7.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Bradford C. Dickerson: A 31-year-old right-handed man was seen in an outpatient neurology clinic of this hospital because of personality changes and progressive neurologic decline. The patient had been well until 3 years before this presentation, when his wife noticed that he was unwilling to share a portable media player that had been given to them, whereas he had previously been very generous and caring. He began to listen obsessively to audio books, insisting that he and his wife listen while cooking or driving. He impulsively purchased items they could not afford. Formerly very social, he began spending time alone; he made mistakes at work and failed advanced-degree examinations. When his wife became pregnant, he repeatedly voiced fears about losing his job if he took paternity leave. He began drinking alcohol and smoking obsessively until he vomited. After the baby was born, he seemed to be disinterested in spending time with his wife and newborn. The patient left his job as a high-school teacher because he planned to run a small home business and care for the infant so his wife could return to work. His clients soon complained about the poor quality of his work. He mixed the infants formula incorrectly and forgot to finish dressing the infant before leaving the house. His wife became concerned and began taking the baby to work, which did not bother the patient. The patient was seen by his physician at another facility for a routine evaluation. His wife reported his withdrawn, compulsive behaviors. He had had a serious head injury with loss of consciousness in a car accident at 12 years of age and was otherwise healthy. A presumptive diagnosis of depression was made. Eleven months after symptom onset, the patient was stopped by police for reckless driving while intoxicated, and he was taken to the emergency department of another hospital. Computed tomography of the head reportedly revealed encepha-lomalacia in the temporal lobes, a finding that was attributed to the head trauma that had occurred during childhood. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for 1 week. A diagnosis of severe depression was made, and he was released to the care of relatives; this caused him to miss Christmas with his wife and child, which did not seem to concern him. During the next 2 months, multiple psychiatric evaluations and two neurologic evaluations were performed. A behavioral neurologic evaluation reportedly revealed mild parkinsonism, attentional and executive dysfunction, memory impairment, anomia, and a flat affect. Dr. Mykol Larvie: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head that was performed during that time revealed severe focal atrophy in the anterior left temporal lobe and relatively mild diffuse atrophy in the frontal lobes Fig. 1A, 1B, and 1C. T2-weighted images showed a small area of hyperintensity in the white matter of the anterior left temporal lobe; the parenchymal signal was otherwise normal. The hyperintensity and focal atrophy in the left temporal lobe might be suggestive of encephalomalacia related to remote trauma, but the atrophy in the frontal lobes is not typical of traumatic brain injury and suggests a neurodegenerative process. Dr. Dickerson: Findings on electroencephalography were reportedly normal. Progressive behavioral deterioration continued; the patient became unable to care for himself. Seventeen months after symptom onset, he moved to another state to live with relatives and attend a full-time day program. One year later at 31 years of age, he returned to New England to be admitted to a neurorehabilitation facility. On admission, he recognized family but was unable to communicate. He was occasionally incontinent. Three years af-ter symptom onset, he was no longer able to walk or feed himself and ate pureed food. He was referred to the outpatient neurology clinic of this hospital. Medications included trazodone, benztro-pine, hydroxyzine, omeprazole, and haloperidol. On examination, the patient was unable to follow commands and had a masked face. He was able to track a dollar bill with his eyes and had intact extraocular movements; smooth-pursuit eye movements revealed saccadic intrusions. He did not reach for the dollar bill when it was offered to him. Muscle bulk was diminished; there were no fasciculations. Tone was increased in all limbs, with mild cogwheel rigidity, occasional myoclonus, and prominent bilateral grasp reflexes. The physical examination was otherwise normal. Additional diagnostic testing was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, most likely due to FUS-related neurodegeneration of an unknown cause or possibly due to a genetic mutation. ", "prediction": "1. Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD): The patient's early personality changes, compulsive behaviors, and progressive neurologic decline, alongside focal atrophy in the anterior left temporal lobe and frontal lobes on MRI, are strongly indicative of FTD. \n2. Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE): Considering the history of head trauma with loss of consciousness, progressive behavioral issues, and the evidence of encephalomalacia in the temporal lobes, CTE is a plausible diagnosis.\n3. Lewy Body Dementia: The presence of parkinsonism, memory impairment, attentional and executive dysfunction, and behavioral changes align with the symptoms of Lewy Body Dementia.\n4. Alzheimer's Disease: Mild diffuse atrophy in the frontal lobes seen on MRI, coupled with memory impairment and executive dysfunction, may point towards early-onset Alzheimer’s disease.\n5. Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features: The initial misdiagnosis of severe depression and the presence of flat affect, anhedonia, and cognitive deficits are consistent with severe major depressive disorder.\n6. Alcohol-Related Neurocognitive Disorder: The patient's history of excessive alcohol consumption and progressive decline in cognitive and functional abilities could be attributed to chronic alcohol abuse leading to neurocognitive impairment.\n7. Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP): Parkinsonism, increased tone, cogwheel rigidity, and saccadic intrusions on smooth pursuit eye movements suggest PSP as a differential.\n8. Huntington’s Disease: Given the progression to severe motor dysfunction, cognitive decline, and behavioral disturbances, Huntington’s disease should be considered.\n9. Autoimmune Encephalitis: The focal atrophy and hyperintensity in the left temporal lobe on MRI, coupled with severe neurological deterioration, raise the possibility of autoimmune encephalitis.\n10. Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH): Although less likely due to lack of characteristic imaging findings, the patient's incontinence, gait disturbance, and cognitive impairment warrant consideration of NPH as an alternative diagnosis."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Emily K. Gray Psychiatry: A 15-year-old girl with Graves disease was admitted to this hospital because of psychotic symptoms. The patient had been well until approximately 3 months before the current admission, when intermittent dizziness, palpitations, near syncope, diaphoresis, polyuria, polydipsia, diarrhea, chest and abdominal pain, headaches, and increasing protuberance of the eyes developed. Eleven weeks before this admission, she was evaluated at school, at an emergency department of another hospital, and at her pediatricians office. She had hypertension, with a blood pressure of up to 168/86 mm Hg, and tachycardia, with a pulse of up to 126 beats per minute. A complete blood count and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, urea nitrogen, and creatinine. Screening of the blood for toxins, Lyme disease, and antibodies against thyroglobulin, microsomes, and thyroperoxidase was negative, as was a urine pregnancy test; other test results are shown in Table 1. A few days later, 10.5 weeks before this admission, she was seen in the endocrinology clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported no intolerance to heat or cold, tremor, or weight loss. She had had anemia as an infant and had undergone a cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis at 14 years of age. Menarche occurred at 11 years of age. She took no medications, her immunizations were up to date, and she had no known allergies. She was born in the Dominican Republic and came to the United States at 6 years of age. She lived with her parents, maternal grandmother, and two sisters. She was enrolled in an individualized education program in high school. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had celiac disease, a paternal aunt had hypothyroidism, her paternal grandmother had vitiligo and had undergone a thyroidectomy, and her father and siblings were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 110/72 mm Hg, and the pulse 114 beats per minute; the temperature and respiratory rate were normal. The height was 166.3 cm, the weight 81.1 kg, and the body-mass index BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 29.3. Proptosis, a pronounced stare, and a tremor of the tongue with protrusion were present. The thyroid was enlarged each lobe 4 cm in diameter, without palpable nodules or an audible thyroid bruit. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Carlos A. Rabito: A thyroid scan, obtained 20 minutes after the intravenous injection of 9.63 mCi of technetium-99m sodium pertechne-tate, showed an enlarged thyroid gland with homogeneously increased tracer uptake Fig. 1A. Technetium-99m is taken up and concentrated by the sodiumiodide symporter of the thyroid gland. In this case, the homogeneity and intensity of the uptake rule out toxic nodular goiter and subacute thyroiditis as causes of the hyperthyroidism. Thyroid uptake is calculated by a comparison of the level of technetium-99m activity in the thyroid lobes and the level in the injected dose, after correction for the camera calibration factor Fig. 1B. The total thyroid uptake of technetium99m in this patient was 8.6 4.5 in the right lobe, and 4.1 in the left lobe; the normal range is 0.5 to 1.7. Both the gland enlargement and the homogeneously increased tracer uptake are consistent with a diagnosis of Graves disease. Dr. Gray: The patient received a diagnosis of Graves disease, and treatment with atenolol 25 mg twice daily and methimazole 30 mg daily was begun. Three weeks later 7.5 weeks before this admission, on follow-up evaluation, the patient reported occasional headaches and dizziness, decreased palpitations and diaphoresis, and improved vision and sleep. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Follow-up with thyroid ablation was planned. During the following month, the patients family noted increasing bulging of her eyes. Approximately 5 weeks before this admission, the patient reported increased distress regarding her physical appearance and a lack of friends. Two weeks later, she told her sister that voices were following her everywhere and that the devil wants me. She cut herself with an earring and told her family that she did not feel safe. Three weeks before this admission, on evaluation in the emergency department of the other hospital, the patient reported awakening each morning around 3 a.m. Her energy and interest levels were low. She reported, “I have wanted to kill myself for a while, but it has gotten worse. I’m just done feeling fat and ugly. I just don’t want to be here.” She also felt tormented by voices that she thought were following her to school; the voices told her not to eat and gave her ideas about ways to kill herself, including “go into the kitchen and get knives.” She had reportedly tried to leave her house in the middle of the night to stab herself. During the previous month, she had begun skipping meals and purging after eating because the internal voices were saying that food was bad. Her performance in school deteriorated. On examination, the blood pressure was 137//81 mm Hg, the pulse 110 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute; the temperature and oxygen saturation were normal. There were superficial lacerations on her wrists and stomach. She was oriented to person, place, and time. She was tearful, sad, and anxious but cooperative. Her speech was normal, and she had ruminative thought processes regarding the voices she was hearing that were instructing her to kill herself. The complete blood count, blood levels of electrolytes and glucose, and results of renal-function tests were normal, and screening for toxins and a urine pregnancy test were negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 120 beats per minute and was otherwise normal. The patient was admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit of the other hospital. The dose of methimazole was increased to 40 mg daily, and treatment with olanzapine (5 mg at bedtime) and lorazepam (1 mg every 4 hours) was begun. She attended group sessions. In the hospital, anxiety decreased, quality of sleep improved, and auditory hallucinations and urges for self-injurious behavior resolved. On the sixth day, she was friendly, calm, and cooperative, with a euthymic mood and congruent affect. Her thought processes were linear and goal-directed, and she had no delusions, evidence of perceptual disturbances, or homicidal or suicidal ideation. She was discharged on the sixth day, after a follow-up appointment in the outpatient endocrinology clinic of this hospital had been scheduled. Medications included methimazole (40 mg daily), atenolol (25 mg twice daily), lorazepam (1 mg every 4 hours), and olanzapine (5 mg at bedtime). During the next week, outpatient evaluations in the endocrinology clinic and at the weight center of this hospital were performed. The height was 166 cm, the weight 85.6 kg, and the BMI 31.1. A complete blood count, lipid profile, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of iron, iron-binding capacity, vitamin B12, ferritin, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, insulin, electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, parathyroid hormone, testosterone, free testosterone, glycated hemoglobin, and total and direct bilirubin; other test results are shown in Table 1. After discharge, the patient became hyper-religious; she impulsively changed churches and talked about “giving herself to God.” Seven days after discharge (8 days before this admission), she ran away from home to meet a man she had met on a social media website. She was found the next day by police and returned to the other hospital. She reported feeling depressed and weak, with decreased energy but without suicidal ideation or hallucinations. She was readmitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit of the other hospital; 1 week later, she was transferred to this hospital.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Anant Mandawat Medicine: A 28-year-old woman was seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of headache, fever, and a rash. The patient had been well until the morning of the day of admission, when she awoke with a severe generalized headache. The headache worsened with movement, was not relieved by acetaminophen or ibuprofen, and was accompanied by nausea and one episode of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis. The patient returned to sleep and awoke again several hours later with diffuse myalgias; her temperature was 37.7C. At that time, she also noted a rash on her abdomen, chest, and right arm; the lesions were small, red, flat, nonpruritic, and nonpainful. She described these symptoms to her father, a physician, who advised her to go to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient reported that the nausea had resolved and that mild neck stiffness had developed. She had had bacterial meningitis at 9 years of age, with symptoms similar to those of the current illness. She had no history of otitis media, sinusitis, pneumonia, or skin infections. She had a remote history of hospitalization after a motor vehicle accident. Ten months before the current illness, she had had an episode of nephrolithiasis with spontaneous passage of a renal stone. She also had a history of anxiety. Her medications were citalopram and a combined estrogenprogestin oral contraceptive. Immunizations were up to date and reportedly included vaccination against Neisseria men-ingitidis. She had no known allergies. She lived alone, worked as a lawyer, and had not recently traveled outside New England or had exposure to sick persons. She had a new boyfriend but was not currently sexually active. She did not smoke or use illicit drugs, and she rarely consumed alcohol. Her parents lived nearby; she had had contact with their two dogs but had not had any recent tick bites, mosquito bites, or exposure to other animals. There was no family history of immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. The temperature was 37.3C, the pulse 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/68 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while she was breathing ambient air. She had scattered petechiae on the chest, abdomen, and thighs and a purpuric lesion on the right shoulder that was tender on palpation without crepitus Fig. 1. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, red-cell indexes, prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, lactic acid level, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alanine aminotransferase, as-partate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and lipase; other test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for influenza virus and respiratory syncy-tial virus were negative. Urinalysis revealed yellow, slightly cloudy urine, with trace ketones and 1 bilirubin, occult blood, albumin, and urobi-linogen by dipstick; there were 3 to 5 white cells and 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field, with 1 bacteria, transitional cells, renal tubular cells, squamous cells, amorphous crystals, and mucin. Specimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture. Lorazepam was administered and a lumbar puncture was performed, after which ceftri-axone, vancomycin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone were administered intravenously. Results of the cerebrospinal fluid CSF analysis are shown in Table 1. Within 90 minutes after the patients arrival at the emergency department, the temperature rose to 39.0C and the pulse increased to 122 beats per minute. Over the next 3 hours, additional petechiae were noted on her trunk, arms, and legs. Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, metoclopramide, potassium chloride, potassium phosphate, and sodium phosphate were administered. Additional laboratory tests were performed; the activated partial-thrombo-plastin time and levels of fibrinogen, haptoglo-bin, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, and the d-dimer level was 785 ng per milliliter reference range, 500. The patient was admitted to the hospital. During the first hospital day, the patient continued to have a headache and was noted to have mild nuchal rigidity, but her fever and tachycardia resolved and her myalgias decreased; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Additional laboratory tests were performed; test results are shown in Table 1. Ceftriaxone, vanco-mycin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone were continued.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Adam W. DeTora Pediatrics: A newborn boy was admitted to this hospital because of respiratory distress and hypotension. The patient was born at another hospital to a 25-year-old mother by normal spontaneous vaginal delivery after a full-term uncomplicated gestation. Results of prenatal ultrasonography at 19 weeks 6 days of gestation were reportedly normal. During labor, the mothers temperature rose to 39.4C, and meconium staining of the amniotic fluid was noted. Clindamycin and gentamicin were administered. During delivery, meconium was suctioned with a bulb syringe from the infants nose and mouth. The baby was limp and blue, without respiratory responses or reflexes. Suctioning of the trachea below the vocal cords produced copious meco-nium. Positive-pressure ventilation was administered. Spontaneous respirations were noted at 2 minutes but were labored, with retractions and grunting. Apgar scores at 1, 5, and 10 minutes were 2, 6, and 6, respectively. The weight was 4775 g 99th percentile, the head circumference 39 cm 99th percentile, and the length 57 cm 100th percentile. The pulse was greater than 100 beats per minute. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Oxygen saturation at 4 minutes and 5 minutes of age was 78 and 86, respectively, with the administration of 100 oxygen. Muscle tone improved within 30 minutes after birth. The infant was transferred to the neonatal special-care nursery while he was receiving continuous positive airway pressure. Severe respiratory distress and hypoxemia persisted; the infant was intubated, given surfactant 70 minutes after birth, and placed on mechanical ventilation. Passive cooling was initiated and then was stopped after neurologic status improved. Catheters were inserted into the umbilical artery and vein and a vein in the left hand. A blood specimen was cultured, and ampicillin and gentamicin were administered. A bolus of normal saline was administered for hypotension. Morphine at a dose of 0.05 mg per kilogram of body weight and midazolam at a dose of 0.05 mg per kilogram were given for sedation because of dyssynchronous breathing and a respiratory rate of greater than 100 breaths per minute. The mean blood pressure ranged from 30 to 39 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation was 80 to 89 with the administration of 100 oxygen. Referral was made to the neonatal intensive care unit ICU transport team of this hospital. The infant was transferred by ambulance, arriving at this hospital approximately 6.5 hours after birth. During transport, the oxygen saturation was 99 with the administration of 100 oxygen. The infants mother had previously had a miscarriage at 3 months of gestation and was otherwise well. Prenatal testing revealed that her blood type was O, Rh positive, with negative antibody screening. Testing for syphilis, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, group B streptococcus colonization, hepatitis B virus, and chlamydia was negative. Her medications included iron and prenatal vitamins. She had not smoked, drunk alcohol, or used illicit drugs during the pregnancy. The maternal grandmother had had a brain aneurysm, and a maternal uncle had multiple skin tumors. There was no family history of early infant or childhood deaths, autism, or macrocephaly. The medical and family history of the childs father was not known. On initial examination, the infant was intubated and sedated but had spontaneous limb movements and was reactive to stimulation. The temperature was 35.2C and rose when the infant was placed on an open warmer; the pulse ranged from 121 to 166 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate was 70 to 80 breaths per minute, with mild subcostal retractions. The head circumference was 41.5 cm 2 SD above the 98th percentile. The skin was pale, with pete-chiae on the abdomen. The abdomen was soft and had hypoactive bowel sounds. The left hand was edematous at the insertion site of a peripheral intravenous catheter. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. During the first day of life, boluses of intravenous fluids containing glucose were administered when blood glucose levels were between 10 mg per deciliter and 40 mg per deciliter; continuous intravenous administration of glucose was begun. Ampicillin and gentamicin were administered. A chest radiograph showed pneu-mothorax on the right side, which was aspirated. Subsequent chest radiographs showed streaky perihilar opacities that were thought to be consistent with meconium aspiration. The temperature rose to 39.0C; acetaminophen was administered, with improvement. The mean arterial pressure ranged from 38 to 57 mm Hg; dopamine and epinephrine were administered, and the doses were adjusted to maintain a mean arterial pressure of greater than 45 mm Hg. Stress-dose hydrocortisone was also administered. Morphine was discontinued, and a continuous infusion of fentanyl was begun. Results of echo-cardiography confirmed elevation of the pulmonary-artery pressure, and therapy with inhaled nitric oxide was initiated, with improvement in oxygenation. Urine output decreased, and edema worsened. Gentamicin was discontinued because of concern about nephrotoxicity, and cefotaxime was begun. The blood levels of phosphorus and ionized calcium were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Fresh-frozen plasma and irradiated, leukocyte-reduced red cells were transfused. On the fourth day, the patient remained lethargic despite the discontinuation of fentanyl and midazolam, but he had occasional spontaneous movements and a strong respiratory drive, with a respiratory rate of 36 to 56 breaths per minute. Test results are shown in Table 1. Infusions of water, glucose, and potassium chloride were administered. Urine output increased to 6 ml per kilogram per hour. Dopamine and epinephrine were tapered on the fourth day and stopped on the sixth day. The fontanelles were full but soft and not bulging. At the end of the sixth day, episodes of myoc-lonus occurred in response to external stimulation. A neurology consultation was obtained. Examination revealed severe eyelid edema, precluding assessment of pupils, gaze, and corneal reflexes; the face was symmetric, with normal tone. The patient moved his limbs in response to noxious stimuli. Reflexes were 3 throughout, with clonus at both ankles 10 to 12 beats. Plantar reflexes were extensor bilaterally. Stimulation induced fast irregular twitches in both arms and sporadically in both legs. Results of electroencephalographic EEG monitoring, which was performed continuously overnight and captured episodes of twitching, were normal. During the next 2 days, the patient remained lethargic, with intermittent clonus. On the eighth day, the anterior fontanelle was full, and there was diastasis of the sagittal suture. There was no spontaneous eye opening or tracking when the eyes were opened. The pupils were 2 mm in diameter and minimally reactive. Tone was decreased, and reflexes were 44 throughout. Whole-body clonus developed when patellar reflexes were elicited. Additional diagnostic testing was performed.

Piantadosi Infectious Diseases: A 27-year-old woman was seen in the emergency department of this hospital during the summer because of arthralgias and a rash. The patient had been well until 5 days before this evaluation, when arthralgias in her fingers, hands, and shoulders developed, along with back pain, neck pain, and a retro-orbital headache. Later that day, fever occurred temperature, 39.0C and was accompanied by chills, nausea, decreased appetite, sore throat, and mild redness of her eyes. She also noted a vaginal ulcer, ulcers on the side of her tongue, decreased taste sensation, and enlarged, tender lymph nodes in her neck and groin. The next morning, the patient awoke with a rash on her right forearm. The lesions were pink, pruritic, and nonpainful; some were flat and others were raised, resembling hives. Within 1 hour, the rash spread to her torso and both arms and legs. She presented to the emergency department of another hospital, where a viral illness was diagnosed on the basis of her clinical presentation; she was discharged home. The following day, the patients arthralgias persisted and involved not only her fingers, hands, and shoulders but also her elbows, knees, ankles, and toes. Swelling in her wrists and hands led her to remove a bracelet and her wedding ring. Her gums bled easily when she brushed her teeth. By that evening, her fever, headache, and rash had remitted. Over the next 2 days, the arthralgias persisted but all other symptoms continued to abate. On the fifth day of illness, a new pruritic, erythematous rash developed, beginning on her palms and spreading to her arms, chest, abdomen, back, and legs, sparing the soles of her feet. The patient took ibuprofen and diphenhydramine and then presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The patient had a remote history of appendectomy. Her only medication was a daily multivitamin, and she had no known allergies. Immunizations were reportedly current. She lived with her husband in a suburban area of New England, worked as a chemical engineer, and enjoyed running. Three days before the onset of illness, the patient had returned from a 7-day trip to the Turks and Caicos Islands, where she spent time on the beach and received multiple mosquito bites. She was monogamous with her husband, consumed alcohol in moderation, did not smoke or use illicit drugs, and had no exposure to sick persons. There was no family history of autoimmune disease. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 36.4C, the pulse 69 beats per minute, the blood pressure 135/87 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while she was breathing ambient air. There was subtle swelling of soft tissue in the hands but no joint effusions; movement of the wrists and finger joints caused mild discomfort. There was a diffuse, erythema-tous, blanching, macular rash involving the abdomen, chest, back, arms, and legs Fig. 1. There were confluent macules on the palms, but the soles of the feet were spared. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The application of a tourniquet to an arm for 2.5 minutes did not precipitate the development of pete-chiae. Results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total biliru-bin, and direct bilirubin; additional test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.011, a pH of 5.0, and negative results for occult blood, leukocyte esterase, nitrite, albumin, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, and urobilinogen. Testing for urinary human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Chikungunya virus infection.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Christopher J. Mutrie Thoracic Surgery: A 58-year-old woman was seen in the outpatient pulmonary clinic of this hospital because of shortness of breath on exertion. The patient had been well until approximately 8 months before this presentation, when she noted shortness of breath while jogging her usual 4 miles daily. During the next 7 months, her symptoms gradually worsened until she became winded within 7 minutes after starting to jog or after climbing stairs, with associated leg fatigue. Approximately 1 month before this evaluation, she was seen at an outpatient clinic of another hospital. On examination, the vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. The oropharyngeal mucosa had a cobblestone appearance, and there were scattered inspiratory wheezes throughout the lung fields. The peak expiratory flow rate measured 400 liters per minute predicted value, 470. A chest radiograph showed reticular linear peripheral opacities predominantly involving the upper lung zones, without pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Results of electrocardiography were normal. Fluticasone two puffs at a strength of 110 g per puff, by inhalation twice daily and an albuterol inhaler with a spacer were prescribed for use before exercise. Five days later, results of pulmonary-function tests and the blood level of d-dimer were normal. Dr. Amita Sharma: The initial chest radiograph showed mild volume loss, biapical pleural thickening, and peripheral nodular opacities in the upper lung zones Fig. 1. One week later, computed tomography CT of the chest, performed without the administration of contrast material, confirmed the presence of bilateral peripheral nodules, which were broad-based and associated with nodular pleural thickening extending into the fissures. Linear bands in the parenchyma were seen adjacent to many peripheral nodules. A few peripheral opacities were present in the middle lung zone, but no abnormalities were seen in the lower lung zone. There was no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Dr. Mutrie: The patient was referred to the outpatient pulmonary clinic of this hospital. She reported no orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, wheezing, pedal edema, cough, sputum production, rash, chills, chest pressure, palpitations, change in bowel habits, or urinary symptoms. She had osteopenia, migraine headaches, hyperlipidemia, seasonal allergies, intermittent mildly elevated aminotrans-ferase levels, and breast calcifications; she had undergone excision of an adenomatous colonic polyp 2 years previously, as well as sinus surgery and a tonsillectomy in the distant past. Additional medications included alendronate, simvastatin, and lorazepam as needed for insomnia. She had no known allergies. She worked in an office. She drank wine occasionally, had stopped smoking 30 years earlier after 3 years of smoking, and did not use illicit drugs. She exercised daily, walking and jogging 4 miles. Her father had cardiac arrhythmias, a sister had breast cancer, another sister possibly had systemic lupus erythematosus, a brother had type 1 diabetes mellitus, one of her children had diabetes mellitus, and another one of her children had a supraventricular arrhythmia. The physical examination was normal, without wheezing, cyanosis, clubbing, or lymphadenopa-thy. Results of pulmonary-function tests were normal; the forced vital capacity FVC was 3.45 liters 101 of the predicted value, the forced ex-piratory volume in 1 second FEV1 2.62 liters 97, the ratio of FEV1 to FVC 0.76, the total lung capacity 5.30 liters 97, and the carbon monoxide diffusing capacity 22.4 92. The blood level of aspartate aminotransferase was 56 U per liter reference range, 9 to 32, the level of alanine aminotransferase was 60 U per liter reference range, 7 to 30, and testing for antinuclear antibody ANA was positive at 1:40 dilution in a homogeneous and speckled pattern reference range, negative at 1:40 and 1:160 dilutions. The complete blood count and white-cell differential count were normal, as were the anion gap and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and angiotensin-converting enzyme; testing was negative for rheumatoid factor, IgG antibodies to anticyclic citrullinated peptide, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ANCA, and IgE antibodies to environmental allergens. Dr. Sharma: At a follow-up examination 2.5 months later, CT of the chest, performed at this hospital after the intravenous administration of contrast material, was largely unchanged Fig. 2.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Ms. Caren T. Harris Pediatric Surgery: A 9-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of loss of consciousness and seizures. The patient had had recent inguinal pain and swelling but had been otherwise well until the morning of admission, in early autumn, when she fell down one stair at home and struck her head. A hematoma developed on the right side of the forehead, without loss of consciousness or other injury. Shortly thereafter, she ate breakfast and then attended a previously scheduled appointment in the outpatient surgery clinic of this hospital to evaluate inguinal pain and swelling on the left side that had lasted for approximately 3 weeks and was near the site of an inguinal herniorrhaphy that had been performed 9 months earlier. On examination, there was mildly tender lymphadenopathy inferior to the left inguinal crease, with a 2-mm punctate lesion superficial to one of the lymph nodes. There were no findings suggestive of cellulitis. Ultrasound studies were scheduled for the next day. Shortly after the patient visited the clinic, approximately 2 hours after she fell down the stair, she fell again from a standing position to the ground at a shopping mall, hitting her head a second time. The patients mother reported that the patient was on the ground, moaning, and frothing at the mouth and that she had tonic clonic movements, with both arms flexed and both feet extended. The patient also had urinary incontinence and one episode of vomiting. The movements resolved within 30 to 60 seconds. Emergency medical services were called. On examination, the patient was in a supine position, crying, and drifting in and out of consciousness. The pulse was 120 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute. The pupils were sluggishly reactive. The patient had spontaneous movement of all limbs, with posturing movements such as bilateral arm retractions to her chest and foot inversions. Oxygen was administered at a rate of 15 liters per minute through a nonrebreather mask, a cervical collar was applied, and she was placed on a backboard and transported by ambulance to this hospital. During transport, one episode of vomiting occurred. The capillary blood glucose level was 108 mg per deciliter, and cardiac monitoring revealed sinus tachycardia without ectopy. She arrived at the emergency department 40 minutes after the second fall. The history was obtained from the patients mother. The patient was born after a full-term gestation, had had normal growth and development, and was right-handed. She had undergone bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphies 9 months earlier. Three weeks before this admission, after returning from a 2-month visit to Puerto Rico, the patient reported discomfort and swelling in the left inguinal region. Her pediatrician prescribed a course of amoxicillin, which she began taking 9 days before this admission; the prescription was changed to amoxicillinclavu-lanic acid after 2 days and then stopped 2 days later by the patients mother because of lack of improvement and possible facial swelling. The patient had received all routine childhood vaccinations, took no other medications, and had no other known allergies. She was born in Puerto Rico and moved to the United States with her mother at 4 years of age. She lived with her mother, stepfather, and siblings in an urban area and was a student. She returned to Puerto Rico in the summers to visit her father. During the most recent visit, she was exposed to mosquitoes, stray kittens, and a pet dog. Her father had hypertension, and other relatives had asthma; there was no family history of seizures or other neurologic diseases. On examination, the patient had incomprehensible speech, was intermittently moaning, and did not follow commands; she had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 10 on a scale of 3 to 15 with lower scores indicating a lower level of consciousness. The temperature was 36.4C, the blood pressure 71/51 mm Hg, the pulse 95 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute; the oxygen saturation ranged from 97 to 100 while she was breathing ambient air. There was a hematoma 2.5 cm by 2.5 cm on the forehead and facial abrasions on the right side. The pupils were round, equal, and sluggishly reactive to light, decreasing from 4 mm to 3 mm in diameter. The patient opened her eyes and had spontaneous movement of her arms and legs, with intermittent diffuse posturing movements. On passive movement, there was more rigidity on the right side than on the left. The left inguinal area contained two palpable lymph nodes 5 mm in diameter and a 2-mm punctate lesion superficial to one of the lymph nodes, without overlying warmth, erythema, or fluctuance. The remainder of the examination was normal. The white-cell count was 14,000 per cubic millimeter reference range, 4500 to 13,500, the blood level of potassium was 3.2 mmol per liter reference range, 3.4 to 4.8, the phosphorus level was 3.5 mg per deciliter reference range, 4.5 to 5.5, and the glucose level was 134 mg per deciliter reference range, 70 to 110. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, white-cell differential count, platelet count, and anion gap were normal, as were blood levels of other electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, amylase, and lipase and results of renal- and liver-function tests. Screening of the blood for toxins was negative. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 134 beats per minute. Diazepam was administered, and the posturing movements transiently resolved; the blood pressure increased to 125/84 mm Hg. Computed tomography CT of the cervical spine and head was performed. Dr. Sandra P. Rincon: CT of the cervical spine, performed with a cervical collar in place, revealed straightening of the normal cervical lordosis and no acute osseous injury. CT of the head revealed a small subgaleal hematoma adjacent to the right frontal bone, without evidence of an underlying fracture. There was no evidence of acute intra-cranial hemorrhage. A small arachnoid cyst was seen in the right middle cranial fossa. Ms. Harris: Approximately 40 minutes after arrival, the patient became less responsive and posturing movements were present. The blood pressure was 119/88 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute; the oxygen saturation decreased to 84 while she was breathing ambient air. On examination without the cervical collar, the neck was supple. Vomitus was suctioned from the airway, and high-flow oxygen was administered. Etomidate and rocuronium bromide were administered intravenously, and the trachea was intubated for airway protection. The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. Three hours after arrival in the emergency department, magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head was performed. Dr. Rincon: MRI of the head revealed restricted diffusion involving the cortex of the right temporal lobe, right occipital lobe, right superior and inferior parietal lobule, and right cingulate gyrus, as well as the right insula and right thalamus Fig. 1A and 1B; fluid-attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR images showed hyperintense signal and mild mass effect related to gyral swelling. Given the patients recent seizure activity, these findings are consistent with excitotoxicity. In a patient with seizure activity, signal abnormality and contrast enhancement due to disruption of the bloodbrain barrier can be observed on MRI and are typically transient. In this case, T1-weighted images that were obtained after the administration of contrast material showed no abnormal enhancement Fig. 1C. Three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography of the intracranial circulation revealed increased flow-related enhancement of the right middle cerebral artery, the right posterior cerebral artery, and their branches Fig. 1D that was due to marked hyperemia on the side of the epileptic focus. Findings associated with hyperemia can also be observed on perfusion imaging. Because seizure-related MRI findings are usually transient, follow-up imaging can be helpful to differentiate abnormalities due to seizures from those due to other causes. The MRI findings could be explained by the patients recent seizure activity, but the differential diagnosis for these findings also includes MELAS mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes, an inherited disorder of intracellular energy production that causes seizures and strokelike cortical lesions that cross vascular territories. Although the findings on imaging, including the pattern of involvement and the absence of contrast enhancement, argue against an infectious cause, infectious causes should also be considered. Ms. Harris: Levetiracetam was administered. Electroencephalography EEG followed by 24-hour EEG monitoring revealed continuous generalized background slowing in the delta and theta ranges, frequent intermittent focal delta-range slowing over the right hemisphere with maximal slowing at times over the right anterior quadrant or right temporal region, and frequent sharp waves in the right frontotemporal region. Seven hours after the patients arrival, lumbar puncture was performed. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid CSF revealed clear, colorless fluid, with a glucose level of 92 mg per deciliter reference range, 50 to 75 and a total protein level of 33 mg per deciliter reference range, 5 to 55, as well as 5 red cells per cubic millimeter and no white cells, other nucleated cells, or xanthochromia. Grams staining revealed very few neutrophils and mononuclear cells and no organisms. Cultures of the blood, urine, and CSF were obtained. Management decisions were made, and additional diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Cat scratch disease (encephalopathy associated with Bartonella henselae). ", "prediction": "1. Post-traumatic epilepsy: The patient experienced head trauma prior to the onset of seizures, which could account for the transient posturing movements and seizure activity noted on her initial presentation.\n2. Inguinal hernia recurrence or testicular torsion: The recent inguinal pain and swelling suggest a possible recurrence of her previous hernia repair or a condition like testicular torsion, which can cause significant discomfort and secondary symptoms.\n3. Transient ischemic attack (TIA): The right-sided rigidity, Glasgow Coma Scale decrease, and posturing movements could suggest a TIA, especially with MRI showing cortical abnormalities.\n4. Arachnoid cyst: The incidental finding of an arachnoid cyst on CT imaging might be contributing to her neurological symptoms through mass effect or irritation.\n5. Meningitis or encephalitis: Despite normal initial CSF findings, the patient’s presentation with reduced consciousness, seizures, and recent travel history might indicate these infections.\n6. Metabolic abnormalities: The slight hypokalemia and phosphorous abnormalities might suggest a broader metabolic disturbance contributing to her seizures and loss of consciousness.\n7. Syncope secondary to hypoglycemia: Considering the episodes of loss of consciousness and normal glucose level post-incident, a prior hypoglycemic event cannot be ruled out.\n8. Toxic exposure: Despite negative screening, her environmental exposure in Puerto Rico to mosquitoes and stray animals raises possibilities like arboviral infections leading to neurologic symptoms.\n9. MELAS syndrome: MRI findings and presentation could be consistent with this mitochondrial disorder that causes stroke-like episodes and seizures.\n10. Sepsis: Despite a lack of overt infection, the recent lymph node enlargement and systemic symptoms raise the possibility of an insidious septic process affecting her neurologic system."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Ashley A. Campbell Ophthalmology: A 41-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of decreased visual acuity in the left eye and diplopia. The patient had been well until 7 weeks before admission, when, in late summer, a moderate frontal headache developed on the left side and then completely resolved after several hours. On awakening the next morning, the left side of her face was numb from lower eyelid to mouth and from nose to ear. She was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital. Computed tomography CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed no evidence of hemorrhage, mass, mass effect, or other intracranial abnormalities. The patient was discharged home. During the next 2 weeks, numbness persisted in the middle of the face; evaluations by her primary care provider, a neurologist, and a dentist did not reveal any abnormalities. Two weeks after the onset of symptoms, the numbness resolved, but ptosis of the left upper eyelid developed, along with double vision that was characterized by one image appearing diagonally over the other. The patient presented to a second hospital, where CT and CT angiography of the head and neck revealed mucosal thickening in the ethmoid sinuses and the left sphenoid sinus, as well as airliquid levels in the maxillary sinuses bilaterally. A complete blood count, white-cell differential count, and metabolic panel were normal, and a pregnancy test was negative. A 2-week course of an unspecified antibiotic agent was administered. Several days later, magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head, performed after the administration of gadolinium, reportedly revealed changes consistent with sinusitis but was otherwise normal. Visual acuity was 2020 in both eyes, and an ophthalmologist prescribed an eye patch to treat diplopia. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid that was obtained during a lumbar puncture including nucleic acid testing for herpes simplex virus and blood cultures were reportedly negative. Two weeks before admission, periorbital pain on the medial left side developed, without pressure, headache, or double vision. One week later, diplopia recurred, with associated abnormal deviation of the left eye. Results of studies of visual evoked potential were nondiagnostic. In the left eye, visual acuity was decreased and color discrimination was abnormal. Three days before admission, the patient had nausea and vomiting, along with vertigo that resulted in her falling in her bathroom. Diplopia persisted, and she rated left periorbital pain at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The evening before admission, repeat MRI was performed at the second hospital. Dr. Mary E. Cunnane: MRI of the head revealed abnormal soft tissue along the anterior and lateral walls of the left sphenoid sinus, in the left orbital apex, and extending posteriorly into the left cavernous sinus. This soft tissue was intermediate in intensity on both a T2-weighted image Fig. 1A and a contrast-enhanced T1-weighted image Fig. 1B. A coronal contrast-enhanced MRI image Fig. 1C showed abnormal enhancement at the junction of the cavernous sinus and Meckels cave on the left side, with enhancing tissue extending to the inner aspect of the fora-men ovale. Dr. Campbell: On the basis of the results of MRI, the patient was advised to go immediately to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival, she reported that ibuprofen provided minimal relief of periorbital pain. She had no history of fever, night sweats, chest pain, dysuria, diarrhea, rashes, muscle or joint aches, or weight loss. She had hypothyroidism, chronic rhinosi-nusitis, and environmental allergies to mold and dust; she had had herpes zoster involving the trigeminal nerve that had resolved and had undergone excision of a breast fibroadenoma in the past. Medications included levothyroxine, aspirin, a calcium supplement with vitamin D, and ibuprofen for pain. She had no known allergies to medications. She lived with her husband and children and worked from her home. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her maternal grandfather had had lymphoma; other family history was not known. On examination, the temperature was 37.4C; the other vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. Ophthalmologic examination revealed visual acuity of 2020 in the right eye and 20400 in the left eye. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive, with a left afferent pupillary defect. Results of color-vision testing with Ishihara color plates were normal on the right side 88 correctly identified and 08 on the left. Intra-ocular pressure was 13 mm Hg on the right side and 11 mm Hg on the left. Slit-lamp examination revealed normal anterior segments bilaterally. Examination of extraocular motility revealed full motility in the right eye; the left eye had limited adduction, supraduction, and infraduc-tion and no abduction, with minimal intorsion on attempted abduction Fig. 2. Trace ptosis of the left upper eyelid was present, and margin reflex distances were 4.5 mm in the right eye and 3.5 mm in the left. Levator function was normal, at 15 mm bilaterally. Exophthalmome-try measurements were 16 mm in the right eye and 18 mm in the left, with a base of 92 mm. There was mildly reduced sensation in response to pinprick in the second branch of the fifth cranial nerve on the left side, and facial strength was normal. Results of funduscopic examination were unremarkable bilaterally; the optic nerves were normal, without pallor, edema, or hemor-rhages. Results of visual-field testing, which was performed reliably on each eye, were normal on the right side; the left side had a large central scotoma, with preservation of the peripheral vision. Endoscopic endonasal examination revealed that the turbinates were moderately hypertrophied; a left septal bone spur and mild-to-moderate septal deviation were present. The remainder of the otolaryngologic, neurologic, and general examinations was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, white-cell count, differential count, platelet count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, C-reactive protein, angio-tensin-converting enzyme, and immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, and IgM and results of renal-function and coagulation tests. Testing for human chorionic gonadotropin in blood and urine was negative. Serum testing was positive for anti-Ro antibodies optical density units, 63.37; reference range, 0 to 19.99 and antinuclear antibodies at 1:40 and 1:160 dilutions, in a homogeneous pattern; testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies anti-PR3 and anti-MPO, anti-La antibodies, and antidouble-stranded DNA antibodies was negative. Urinalysis revealed 1 ketones, trace occult blood, and protein by dipstick, with 0 to 2 red cells, very few renal tubular cells, and few squamous cells per high-power field and mucin per low-power field. The patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second day, a lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 17.5 cm of water. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed very few mononuclear cells and no white or red cells. Levels of glucose, total protein, and angiotensin-converting enzyme were normal; testing for very-low-density lipoprotein was negative. Grams staining revealed no organisms, electrophoresis revealed no oligoclonal bands, and cytologic examination revealed no malignant cells. A chest radiograph showed clear lungs and no evidence of medias-tinal lymphadenopathy. On the third day, CT of the orbits was performed. Dr. Cunnane: CT of the orbits Fig. 1D revealed that the bone between the abnormal soft tissue in the left sphenoid sinus and the abnormal soft tissue in the left orbital apex is largely intact. Dr. Campbell: On the fourth day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Lymphoma. ", "prediction": "1. Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome: This inflammatory disorder of the cavernous sinus, superior orbital fissure, or orbit can cause painful ophthalmoplegia and is characterized by the MRI findings of inflammation without bone destruction.\n2. Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis: Given the abnormal soft tissue in the left cavernous sinus and the progressive nature of the ocular symptoms, a thrombosis could explain the acute onset of diplopia and periorbital pain.\n3. Sinusitis with Orbital Extension: The patient's history of chronic rhinosinusitis and MRI findings of mucosal thickening suggest that a sinus infection may have spread to the orbit.\n4. Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation: A possibility due to the presence of orbital apex inflammation, which can present with similar ocular findings and is often seen in middle-aged women.\n5. Sarcoidosis: The presence of anti-Ro antibodies and abnormal MRI findings could indicate an inflammatory disease such as sarcoidosis, which often affects the CNS and can present with orbital involvement.\n6. Multiple Sclerosis: The abnormal visual evoked potentials and color vision defects could be indicative of optic neuritis, a common initial presentation of multiple sclerosis.\n7. Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis): Although anti-PR3 and anti-MPO antibodies were negative, the orbital and sinus involvement could still fit the clinical pattern of this vasculitic disease.\n8. Orbital Cellulitis: Despite the absence of fever and overt signs of infection, the progression from sinus disease to orbital apex and cavernous sinus involvement raises the possibility of a deep-seated infection.\n9. Intracranial Neoplasm: The progressive nature of the symptoms and soft tissue findings on MRI could be due to a tumor involving the cavernous sinus or orbital apex, despite the lack of malignancy on cytologic examination.\n10. Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus: Given her past history of herpes zoster involving the trigeminal nerve, reactivation of the virus could potentially be causing the current symptoms, even if testing was negative."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Katharine R. Clapham Medicine: A 71-year-old man with congestive heart failure and ischemic cardiomyopathy was admitted to this hospital because of sudden chest pain, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath. The patient had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and ischemic cardiomyopathy and had a history of myocardial infarctions an inferoposterior myocardial infarction, which had occurred 29 years earlier, and an apical infarction, which had occurred 14 years earlier and for which percutaneous balloon angioplasty of the first marginal branch of the left circumflex artery had been performed. Nine years before the current admission, a cardiac stress test with radionuclide imaging revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 33 and a reversible antero-lateral defect; subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed severe disease in the right coronary artery and in branches of the left circumflex artery. Seven months before the current admission, echocardiography revealed that the left ventricular ejection fraction had worsened to 22, and a subsequent cardiac stress test with radionuclide imaging performed at this hospital revealed a markedly dilated left ventricle, with large, dense inferior and lateral scars and associated minimal in-feroapical ischemia. Eleven weeks before the current admission, transthoracic echo-cardiography performed at this hospital revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 23, dilatation of the left atrium anteroposterior dimension, 39 mm and left ventricle end diastolic dimension, 55 mm, diffuse hypokinesis of both ventricles mild in the right and severe in the left, mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and no pericardial effusion. Three weeks later 8 weeks before the current admission, the patient was seen in the cardiac-arrhythmia clinic of this hospital to be evaluated for the placement of an implantable cardioverterdefibrillator ICD. He reported exertional dyspnea that was consistent with a New York Heart Association NYHA functional class of II. He had no palpitations, presyncopal symptoms, syncopal events, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. His weight was stable. His medications were aspirin, irbesartan, carvedilol, hydrochlorothiazide, isosorbide mononitrate, ator-vastatin, metformin, sitagliptin, and loratadine. He was allergic to penicillin and cephalosporins, which caused a rash, and he reported cough with the use of angio-tensin-convertingenzyme inhibitors. He was married and had adult children. He had a smoking history of 45 pack-years but had stopped smoking 29 years earlier, and he had recently decreased alcohol consumption from 10 drinks per week to 4 on the advice of his clinicians; he did not use illicit drugs. Several relatives had diabetes mellitus. On examination at that visit, the blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg, the pulse 60 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 28.1. The jugular venous pressure was 6 cm of water; the remainder of the examination was normal, with no cardiac murmur or rub. Placement of an ICD was advised. Ten days before the current admission, a dual-chamber ICD system was inserted through the left axillary vein. Intravenous vancomycin was administered immediately before the procedure. Immediately after the procedure, the patient was admitted to this hospital for routine monitoring. Chest radiographs that were obtained after the procedure and the following morning showed the ICD pulse generator on the left side of the chest, with ICD lead tips projecting over the right atrium and right ventricle, as well as clear and inflated lungs, mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette which was stable, as compared with the silhouette seen on earlier radiographs, and no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The morning after ICD placement, repeat device interrogation was performed, and all measurements were within acceptable limits. The patient was discharged home later that day. During the next 9 days, he noted occasional mild positional pain at the ICD placement site that was relieved with acetaminophen. No skin changes or swelling at the ICD placement site were noted. At 6 p.m. on the day of the current admission, midsternal chest discomfort and associated dia-phoresis and mild dyspnea developed suddenly while the patient was watching television. The pain was exacerbated by movement and deep inspiration, did not radiate, was possibly improved by leaning forward, and was distinct from the pain at the ICD placement site that had been previously reported. The patient had no associated headache, light-headedness, palpitations, cough, nausea, vomiting, fever, or chills. He took two acetaminophen tablets for the pain, and after it lasted for more than 1 hour, he sought medical attention. On arrival in the emergency department, approximately 3.5 hours after the onset of symptoms, the patient rated the pain at rest at 0 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The midsternal pain could be reproduced with deep inspiration; he rated that pain at 7 of 10. On examination, the temperature was 36.1C, the blood pressure 130/70 mm Hg, the pulse 78 beats per minute and irregular, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The skin was cool, with no inflammation or hematoma over the ICD placement site. Adhesive strips over the incision were intact. The first and second heart sounds were normal, with no murmur, and the breath sounds were slightly diminished at the bases. The jugular venous pressure was not recorded, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Cardiac telemetry showed sinus rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions. Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, and phosphorus were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Anand M. Prabhakar: Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs Fig. 1 showed a new left pleural effusion, with no other clinically significant changes, as compared with the chest radiograph that was obtained immediately after the procedure. The cardiomediastinal silhouette was within normal limits, and the ICD leads appeared to be in a position similar to that on the previous radiograph. Dr. Clapham: Cardiac ultrasonography, performed at the bedside by emergency department personnel, revealed trace pericardial effusion and decreased ventricular contractile function. An electrocardiogram ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 66 beats per minute, with new ST-segment elevations in ECG leads II, III, aVF, V3, and V4  Fig. 2. Aspirin, magnesium sulfate, and insulin were administered. Twenty-six minutes later, approximately 3 hours after the patients presentation, severe pain recurred. Fentanyl was administered intravenously. Approximately 30 minutes after the onset of this pain, light-headedness, dizziness, diaphoresis, nausea, and transient hypo-tension blood pressure, 67/44 mm Hg occurred, with a pulse of 59 beats per minute. These symptoms spontaneously improved within minutes; the systolic blood pressure rose to 92 mm Hg and subsequently ranged between 80 and 92 mm Hg, and the pulse ranged between 57 and 64 beats per minute. Vancomycin was administered. Five hours after presentation, the patient was admitted to the cardiology service. On arrival, the blood pressure was 120/55 mm Hg, and the pulse was 65 beats per minute, with an inspiratory decline in systolic pressure of less than 5 mm Hg. Breath sounds were diminished at the left base, the jugular venous pressure was 9 cm of water, and there were normal heart sounds, with no rubs or murmurs; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. A repeat chest radiograph was unchanged, as compared with a radiograph obtained on admission. Approximately 13 hours after the patients presentation, diagnostic procedures were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Perforation of the right ventricular wall by an implantable cardioverter–defibrillator lead. ", "prediction": "1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): Given the patient's history of ischemic heart disease, new ST-segment elevations, and sudden onset of severe chest pain, ACS is the most likely diagnosis.\n2. Pericarditis: The pain improved by leaning forward and the new trace pericardial effusion suggestation could indicate pericarditis, particularly post-procedural.\n3. ICD Lead Misplacement/Injury: New chest pain following ICD placement could result from lead misplacement or myocardial injury.\n4. Pulmonary Embolism: Sudden onset of chest pain and dyspnea, though less likely given the absence of significant risk factors like recent immobility or known venous thromboembolism.\n5. Pneumothorax: Although less likely due to clear lung sounds and absence of pneumothorax on chest radiographs, post-ICD procedure monitoring necessitates considering this.\n6. Heart Failure Exacerbation: Worsening dyspnea and new radiographic findings of pleural effusion can indicate decompensation of chronic congestive heart failure.\n7. Pleural Effusion: The new pleural effusion noted on chest radiograph could explain the patient's symptoms.\n8. Infection/Sepsis: Though less likely given stable vital signs initially, post-procedural infection remains a potential consideration, especially with recent ICD placement and new onset of symptoms.\n9. Costochondritis: The reproducibility of pain on deep inspiration could suggest musculoskeletal origin, such as costochondritis.\n10. Stable Angina: The patient's significant cardiac history and risk factors for ischemic heart disease necessitate considering stable angina as a differential, despite the presentation leaning more towards ACS."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Emily B. Rubin Pediatrics: A newborn girl was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit NICU of this hospital on the first day of life because of hypoten-sion, coagulopathy, anemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. At an affiliated hospital, the infant was born by cesarean section to a 30-year-old primigravida mother at 34 weeks 6 days of gestation, after late-onset oligohy-dramnios and premature labor occurred and a nonreassuring fetal heart-rate pattern developed. The membranes were ruptured at delivery, and the baby emerged vigorous, with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The weight was 2.15 kg 34th percentile for gestational age, the head circumference 31.5 cm 54th percentile, and the length 46 cm 64th percentile. The oxygen saturation was 95 while the baby was breathing ambient air. The initial blood pressure was 40/25 mm Hg reference range for a premature newborn, 55 to 75 systolic and 35 to 45 diastolic, with a mean arterial pressure of 25 mm Hg; the remainder of the examination revealed features consistent with those of a late preterm infant. The standard dose of vitamin K was administered shortly after birth. The infant was admitted to the special-care nursery. Subsequent blood-pressure recordings reportedly revealed a systolic blood pressure between 30 and 39 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure between 10 and 19 mm Hg. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and boluses of normal saline and dextrose were administered, without improvement. Blood oozed at the site of peripheral punctures, and fresh-frozen plasma was administered. A repeat hematocrit was 29, and packed red cells were transfused. A chest radiograph reportedly showed diffuse, nonspecific pulmonary haziness. A blood culture was performed, and ampicillin and gentamicin were administered 1 and 2 hours after birth, respectively. Approximately 7.5 hours after birth, the total serum bilirubin level was 6.4 mg per deciliter 109 mol per liter and the direct bilirubin level was 1.5 mg per deciliter 26 mol per liter; phototherapy was begun. A KleihauerBetke test hemoglobin F stain for fetalmaternal hemorrhage fetal blood loss across the placenta and into the maternal circulation was positive 4 hours after birth. Fresh-frozen plasma was transfused 14 hours after birth. Blood samples were obtained on the first day of life, before the transfusions were performed, and sent to the New England Newborn Screening Program; the results were reportedly indeterminate, and a requested follow-up sample could not be definitively interpreted because blood products had been administered. Hypotension persisted. Dopamine was administered intravenously, and the blood pressure rose to 64/24 mm Hg, with a mean arterial pressure of 36 mm Hg. Anuria developed. The patient was transferred to this hospital by the neonatal transport team, arriving 16 hours after birth. The patients mother had a history of genital herpes and had been treated during the pregnancy with valacyclovir; she had no active lesions at delivery. She had received prenatal care and was immune to rubella; tests for hepatitis B surface antigen and syphilis were negative. Her ABO blood type was O, Rh positive, and screening for antibodies to red cells was negative. Results of testing for group B streptococcus were not known. She reported no history of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit-drug use. She had emigrated from eastern Europe 12 years earlier, lived with the infants father, and worked in an office. On examination, the infant was nondysmor-phic, with pink skin, a normal cry, and normal activity. The blood pressure was 58/28 mm Hg with a mean arterial pressure of 38 mm Hg, the pulse 168 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 30 to 49 breaths per minute, and the temperature 36.8C. A harsh systolic murmur, grade 26, was loudest at the left lower sternal border, and there were mild respiratory retractions and coarse breath sounds. The umbilical-cord stump oozed blood; bruising was present around sites of intravenous-catheter insertion, and there was a small cafe au lait spot on the left side of the chest. Muscle tone was slightly decreased, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of phosphorus and calcium were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Radiographs of the chest and abdomen revealed clear lungs and a normal bowel-gas pattern. Infusions of glucose and dopamine were continued; acyclovir, phytonadione vitamin K, ampicillin, cefotaxime, and oxygen through a nasal cannula were administered. Cryoprecipitate 1 unit and fresh-frozen plasma 1 unit were transfused. Over-night, generalized edema increased, and ecchy-moses and bleeding at the venipuncture sites and crackling breaths sounds developed. On the second day of life, urine output remained minimal. Results of screening for partial-thromboplastin timelupus anticoagulant were interpreted as negative. Additional laboratory test results were obtained Table 1. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a patent foramen ovale with trace left-to-right shunting, a patent ductus arteriosus 2 mm in diameter, dilatation of the ascending aorta, trace aortic insufficiency, elevated pulmonary resistance, slight right ventricular dilatation, and normal left ventricular function estimated ejection fraction, 65. Oxygen saturation decreased to 89 to 91. Midazolam and fentanyl were administered, the trachea was intubated, mechanical ventilation was initiated, and a central venous catheter was placed. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI was performed without the administration of gadolinium. T2-weighted imaging showed a diffuse hypoin-tense signal in the liver and pancreas, a moderate amount of ascites, and anasarca. The kidneys appeared to be normal. Vecuronium, vancomycin, calcium gluconate, furosemide, famotidine, vitamin E, total parenteral nutrition, and additional doses of acyclovir, cefotaxime, ampicillin, and vitamin K were administered, and infusions of glucose and dopamine were continued. Additional fresh-frozen plasma, packed red cells, platelets, and albumin were transfused. A rectal culture for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, a nasal culture for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and a blood culture were negative. The next day, ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed ascites and normal kidneys; intrarenal arterial Doppler ultrasonography revealed an absence of diastolic flow, which was most likely caused by vasopressor treatment, and no evidence of renal-artery stenosis or renal-vein thrombosis. Dopamine was tapered and discontinued, and a mean arterial pressure above 40 mm Hg was maintained without the use of pressors. Additional diagnostic procedures were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Neonatal hemochromatosis (gestational allo-immune liver disease). ", "prediction": "1.

The patient, who lived and worked in a city in Vietnam, had been well until approximately 1 month before the current admission, when episodes of throbbing discomfort in the right upper quadrant described as rolling spasms developed; the episodes lasted for approximately 20 to 30 minutes at a time and resolved without treatment after 5 days. Approximately 2.5 weeks before the current admission, fevers, shaking chills, and body aches developed; the patient took ibuprofen but the symptoms did not improve. The next day, he was seen by a physician at an infirmary for international persons. Acetaminophen was administered; the fever reportedly abated, and the patient returned home. During the night, the temperature rose to 40.6C, with rigors. He returned to the infirmary and was admitted to one of two inpatient beds. The patient had previously been well. He had no known allergies. He drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. He was married and had two young children. He was born in and had lived in New England until 10 years earlier, when he moved to Vietnam. He was a professor at an academic institution in Massachusetts. He lived in an urban apartment complex and took occasional trips to Cambodia and New England. He had not traveled during the previous month. He had received all the indicated vaccines before moving to Vietnam and had had no recent exposure to sick persons. A physical examination was reportedly normal. The bilirubin level was reportedly mildly elevated, and laboratory tests were negative for dengue NS1 antigen, malaria, antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus HIV, Salmonella typhi H and O antigens, S. paratyphi AH and BH antigens, cytomegalovirus, EpsteinBarr virus, parasites, IgM antibodies to chikungunya virus, antigens to influenza virus types A and B, and group A streptococcal pharyngitis; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis and a chest radiograph were normal. Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and omeprazole were administered, without improvement. During the next 2 days, the temperature rose intermittently to 41.0C, with rigors. A transthoracic echocardiogram reportedly showed trace mitral regurgitation and mild left atrial dilatation. Abdominal ultraso-nography revealed a mildly enlarged liver mid-clavicular longitudinal dimension, 17 to 18 cm; upper limit of normal, 13 to 15 cm and spleno-megaly length of the spleen, 14.9 cm. On the third day at the infirmary, results of computed tomography CT of the chest were normal; CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed an enlarged liver and spleen. Other test results are shown in Table 1. On the fourth day at the infirmary, fevers persisted. On the recommendation of a physician in Massachusetts, the patient was transferred to an international hospital in Thailand. On admission, the blood pressure was 140/78 mm Hg, the pulse 106 beats per minute, the temperature 38.1C several hours after acetaminophen had been administered, and the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute; the remainder of the examination was normal. The activated partial-throm-boplastin time and estimated glomerular filtration rate were normal, as were the red-cell indexes and blood levels of sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and globulin. Tests were negative for dengue NS1 antigen, malaria by means of polymerase-chain-reaction assay, influenza virus types A and B, HIV, IgM antibodies to chikun-gunya virus, and hepatitis B and C viruses; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed yellow, slightly turbid urine, with 1 protein and blood, urobilinogen, and 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field reference range, 0 to 5 and was otherwise normal. A stool examination was reportedly negative for parasites. Radio-graphs of the chest and paranasal sinuses were reportedly normal; a radiograph of the abdomen, obtained with the patient in an upright position, showed a small calcification at the left side of the pelvic cavity that was thought to be a phlebo-lith or bladder stone. CT images of the abdomen that were obtained at the infirmary were reviewed and thought to show hepatosplenomegaly. Potassium chloride was administered. During the patients first full day at the international hospital the seventh day of the febrile illness, abdominal ultrasonography revealed hepatosplenomegaly, a hepatic cyst 0.9 cm in diameter at segment VI, and a hyperechoic nodule 1.7 cm in diameter at the right lobe, anterior to the inferior vena cava, that was thought to represent a hepatic hemangioma. During the next 2 days, the temperature rose to between 38.0C and 39.8C. On the fourth hospital day, doxycycline therapy was begun for possible rickettsial infection. Later that day, one of three blood cultures that had been obtained on the day of admission grew gram-positive cocci in chains; the cocci were identified as Streptococcus constellatus, subspecies constellatus. Ceftriaxone therapy 2 g daily was begun, and doxycycline therapy was stopped. The next day, a transesophageal echocardiogram showed trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, with no evidence of endocarditis; the ejection fraction was 62. The patient began to feel better. On the sixth hospital day, after 12 days of illness, fevers resolved. Repeat blood cultures were sterile. Blood levels of electrolytes, globulin, alpha-fetoprotein, and prostate-specific antigen were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. The physician in Massachusetts recommended that the patient undergo additional testing. On the seventh hospital day, CT of the abdomen performed after the intravenous, oral, and rectal administration of contrast material reportedly revealed abdominal lymphadenopathy, hepato-splenomegaly, multiple hypodense nodular lesions in the liver, enlargement and heterogeneous enhancement of the pancreatic head, and thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein. Specialists in hematology and gastroenterology were consulted. Endoscopic ultrasonography was scheduled, and anticoagulation was begun. The CA 19-9 level was normal. On the 11th hospital day, CT images were transmitted to this hospital for review. The next day, the patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation and management.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Streptococcus constellatus bacteremia with a liver abscess. ", "prediction": "1. Hepatic abscess: The patient's fever, hepatomegaly, and the presence of multiple hypodense nodular lesions in the liver on CT imaging suggest the possibility of hepatic abscess.\n2. Infective endocarditis: Although the transesophageal echocardiogram did not show endocarditis, the presence of gram-positive cocci (Streptococcus constellatus) in blood cultures warrants consideration given the patient's systemic symptoms and history of fever.\n3. Rickettsial infection: The patient’s fever, shaking chills, and body aches, along with improvement upon doxycycline administration, suggest a possible rickettsial infection despite negative test results.\n4. Malaria: Despite negative malaria tests, the patient's symptoms and geographical location in a malaria-endemic region necessitate consideration, especially due to the episodic nature of fever.\n5. Leptospirosis: The patient's presentation of high fever, chills, and hepatosplenomegaly, along with potential exposure to contaminated water in Vietnam, points toward leptospirosis as a differential diagnosis.\n6. Tuberculosis: Hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and persistent fever could potentially indicate disseminated or extrapulmonary tuberculosis, despite a normal chest radiograph.\n7. Viral hepatitis: Given the mild elevation in bilirubin and the negative tests for hepatitis B and C, other viral hepatitis forms should still be considered as a cause of hepatosplenomegaly and fever.\n8. Brucellosis: The endemic nature in Vietnam, coupled with symptoms of fever, chills, and splenomegaly, merits brucellosis as a differential despite the lack of recent animal exposure.\n9. Pyogenic liver abscess: The liver cyst found on imaging, combined with the fever and abdominal discomfort, could indicate a pyogenic liver abscess.\n10. Lymphoma: Persistent fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and abdominal lymphadenopathy, along with the heterogeneous pancreatic head, could suggest an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder like lymphoma."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Diane Tseng Medicine: A 20-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of fever and a pericardial effusion. The patient had been well until 5 weeks before this admission, when sore throat, subjective fever, malaise, and diffuse myalgias developed. On evaluation by his primary care physician on the second day of illness, a clinical diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis was made, and a 7-day course of oral penicillin was prescribed. Three days later, the patient was seen in an urgent care clinic because of fatigue and worsening myalgias. He reported that the sore throat and fever had improved. A rapid antigen test for group A streptococcus was negative, and the patient returned home. Fifteen days later, the patient returned to the urgent care clinic with persistent myalgias and malaise and a 5-day history of increased sore throat and fever. A throat culture for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus was positive, and a blood culture was negative. Oral levofloxacin was prescribed, and the patient returned home. Four days later, shortness of breath and pain on the left side of the chest developed. The patient returned to his primary care physician. The chest pain, which he rated at 6 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain, increased with deep inspiration and radiated to the left shoulder and back. The sore throat had improved, but fever, myalgias, and malaise persisted. The patient appeared ill. The white-cell count was 23,800 per cubic millimeter reference range, 4700 to 10,800, the C-reactive protein level was 29.5 mg per deciliter reference value, 0.8, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 96 mm per hour reference value, 15, and a blood culture was obtained. The next day, the patient was admitted to a hospital near his home. The temperature was 39.4C, and tachycardia was present. Tests for influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus were negative. A computed tomographic CT scan of the neck and a transthoracic echocardiogram were reportedly normal. Oral azithromy-cin and intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and hydromorphone hydrochloride were administered. The patients pain improved somewhat, but fever and shortness of breath persisted. On the third hospital day, CT of the chest reportedly revealed right hilar and mediastinal adenopathy, small bilateral pleural effusions, bibasilar atelec-tasis, and no evidence of acute pulmonary embolism. A test for human immunodeficiency virus was negative. Antibodies indicative of past infection with EpsteinBarr virus were detected. Over the next 2 days, abdominal pain developed. On the fifth hospital day, CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed; no abnormalities were noted in the abdomen or pelvis, but moderate bilateral pleural effusions, dependent bibasi-lar opacities, and a moderate pericardial effusion were seen in the visualized portion of the lower thorax. A transesophageal echocardio-gram that was obtained the next day showed a small circumferential pericardial effusion with some fibrinous strands; no vegetations were seen, and the estimated ejection fraction was 65. A tuberculin skin test was negative. Indomethacin and colchicine were administered orally. Swelling of the shoulders and elbows, stiffness of the shoulders, and a faint erythematous rash on the face, neck, and arms developed. Fever with temperatures between 38.9C and 39.4C and myalgias persisted, and dyspnea progressively increased. The administration of intravenous fluids and supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute was begun. An antistreptolysin O titer was 289 IU per milliliter reference value, 530. On the 11th hospital day, a repeat transthoracic echocardio-gram showed a large anterior pericardial effusion and a moderate posterior pericardial effusion, as well as marked respiratory variation of tricuspid inflow. The patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit at this hospital. On admission to this hospital, the patient reported pain on the left side of the chest and in the left shoulder, dyspnea, diffuse myalgias, anorexia, and loose stools. His parents also reported that he had had jerking movements during sleep over the past 2 days. The patient was a college student and lived with roommates. He was sexually active and consistently used condoms. He had had no exposure to animals and had not traveled outside New England during the previous 4 years. He did not use tobacco, but he smoked marijuana approximately two times per month and drank five or six beers once per week. He had no known allergies. His brother had recently died at 32 years of age from intravenous-drug use that was complicated by fungal endocarditis with an abscess of the mitral-valve ring. On examination, the patient appeared pale and fatigued. The temperature was 37.7C, the pulse 102 beats per minute, the blood pressure 162/83 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94 while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. Pulsus paradoxus measured 14 mm Hg. The heart sounds were distant. The jugular venous pressure was greater than 19 cm of water, and Kuss-mauls sign distention of the jugular veins during inspiration was present. There was dullness on percussion at both lung bases, and Ewarts sign dullness inferior to the left scapula, with bronchial breath sounds and bronchophony was present. There was pitting edema of the legs below the knees and mild swelling around the shoulders and elbows, without effusions. There were faint pink macules on the forearms and the right antecubital fossa Fig. 1 that were no longer visible after 1 hour. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of magnesium, phosphorus, glucose, globulin, alanine amino-transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bili-rubin, direct bilirubin, amylase, and lipase. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The results of urinalysis were normal. A blood culture, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and echocar-diogram were obtained. Dr. Jonathan A. Scheske: An anteroposterior chest radiograph Fig. 2A, obtained with the patient in an upright position, showed that the cardiac silhouette was symmetrically enlarged and had an appearance that was consistent with the water-bottle sign in which the rounded and enlarged cardiac silhouette on frontal chest radiography mimics the appearance of an old-fashioned water bottle; this finding is classically associated with pericardial effusion. There were no signs of specific cardiac-chamber enlargement, although cardiac dilatation could also cause the symmetrically enlarged cardiac silhouette. The presence of cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature, indistinct vascular markings, and peribronchial cuffing was consistent with interstitial pulmonary edema. There was blunting of the costo-phrenic angles and opacification of the lower lung zones bilaterally; these findings are consistent with bilateral small pleural effusions larger on the left side than on the right and associated atelectasis. A transthoracic echocardiogram Fig. 2C showed normal biventricular function and chamber size, only trace tricuspid regurgitation, and no other valvular abnormalities. Circumferential pericardial effusion was seen, with maximum diastolic dimensions of 3.6 cm posterior to the right atrium, 2.5 cm at the lateral wall of the left ventricle, and 2.0 cm anteriorly. Fibrin strands were attached to the visceral pericardium, but this layer did not appear thickened or have parallel motion with the parietal pericardial layer on M-mode tracings a finding that would have suggested constriction. Bilateral pleural effusions were present. The inferior vena cava measured 2.3 cm in diameter and did not collapse with inspiration, and there were exaggerated respirophasic variations in the transtricuspid and transmitral flow velocities that were suggestive of elevated intrapericardial pressure. Right atrial inversion and intermittent, transient, late diastolic inversion of the right ventricular free wall were seen. These findings are consistent with hemodynamically significant pericar-dial effusion. Dr. Tseng: A diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Adult-onset Still’s disease. ", "prediction": "1. Acute pericarditis: The patient's fever, chest pain radiating to the shoulder, and echocardiographic findings of pericardial effusion suggest acute pericarditis.\n2. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis: Persistent myalgias, fever following streptococcal infection, and elevated inflammatory markers are consistent with this immune-mediated condition.\n3. Rheumatic fever: Symptoms including fever, polyarthritis, and erythematous rash following streptococcal pharyngitis suggest rheumatic fever despite the low ASO titer.\n4. Infective endocarditis: The patient's symptoms of fever, malaise, and echocardiographic findings could indicate infective endocarditis, though no vegetations were evident.\n5. Tuberculosis pericarditis: Despite a negative tuberculin skin test, the bilateral pleural effusions and persistent fever could be indicative of TB pericarditis.\n6. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): The patient's pleural and pericardial effusions, along with rash and diffuse myalgias, could point to an underlying autoimmune disorder like SLE.\n7. Viral myocarditis: The initial presentation with sore throat, followed by symptoms of myocarditis with elevated inflammatory markers suggests a possible viral etiology.\n8. Sarcoidosis: The hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy seen on CT and systemic symptoms might indicate sarcoidosis with cardiac involvement.\n9. Hematologic malignancy: Symptoms such as persistent fever, myalgias, and lymphadenopathy warrant consideration of lymphoma or leukemia.\n10. Drug-induced pericarditis: The timeline of symptoms worsening with multiple antibiotic treatments might suggest an adverse drug reaction leading to pericarditis."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Brian C. Zanoni Infectious Disease: A 28-year-old pregnant woman gravida 3, para 0020 was admitted to this hospital in the summer because of fever, chills, headache, and fatigue. The patient had been well until approximately 5 days before admission, at 28 weeks of gestation, when she noted feeling warm, which she attributed to a malfunctioning air-conditioning system at work. Three days before admission, malaise and headaches occurred. The next day, she called her health care providers about her symptoms and reported Braxton Hicks contractions and frequent fetal movement, with no fevers, vaginal bleeding, or leaking of fluid. She was advised to rest and increase her fluid intake. That night, she took diphenhydramine for sleep. The day before admission, she came to the outpatient obstetrics clinic of this hospital because of a temperature of 37.4C. She reported decreased fetal movement at home, which improved on arrival to the clinic. She was taking prenatal vitamins. She was allergic to cephalexin and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, which caused a rash, and to multiple fruits and vegetables, which caused anaphylaxis. On examination, the temperature was 36.7C, the blood pressure 103/66 mm Hg, and the pulse 72 beats per minute. The abdomen was soft and nontender, without palpable uterine contractions. On a nonstress test, the average fetal heart rate was 125 beats per minute, with moderate variability and positive accelerations; these findings were interpreted as reassuring. On ultrasonography, fetal biometric measurements were consistent with a weight of 1244 g 51st percentile for 28 weeks 4 days of gestation, and there was appropriate gradual growth since a previous scan had been obtained, as well as a normal volume of amniotic fluid; the fetus was active. Later that day, the patient traveled to a coastal area in Massachusetts that she visited weekly. That evening, increased fatigue, diffuse body aches, low back pain, and an earache occurred, and the temperature rose to 38.6C. The obstetrician who was on call that evening recommended that the patient go to a local emergency department for evaluation; the examination was reportedly normal. There was a platelet count of 125,000 per cubic millimeter, and a peripheral-blood smear showed no evidence of babesia; other laboratory test results were reportedly negative. Results of testing for Lyme disease were pending. The patient returned to her coastal vacation residence. Overnight, the temperature rose to 38.8C. On the morning of admission, the patient called her obstetricians office at this hospital to report fever, with a current temperature of 37.4C. She was advised to take acetaminophen, drink fluids, rest, and return for evaluation if she began feeling worse. Later that day, the temperature rose to 39.4C and nausea developed. That evening, she presented to the labor and delivery unit of this hospital. On presentation, the patient reported mild headache, neck stiffness, a left earache, intermittent contractions, and a possible erythematous rash on her right shin; she had no joint symptoms, vomiting, ear drainage, hearing difficulty, or upper respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary symptoms. She was gravida 3, had had two previous spontaneous miscarriages, and had received prenatal care, with testing that was positive for rubella-specific antibodies and negative for syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus HIV, hepatitis C virus, and hepatitis B virus surface antigen. The patient had a history of thrombophilia and gastroesophageal reflux disease associated with aspirin use and was heterozygous for factor V Leiden. She reported contact with an indoor cat at home and with outdoor cats and dogs at the home of relatives; she knew of bats in the vicinity of her home and mice in the basement of her coastal vacation residence. She had no known sick contacts, insect bites, or consumption of unpasteurized dairy products. She had traveled to Western Europe, Central America, Mexico, and Asia within the previous 3 years. She worked in an office, had stopped smoking 5 years earlier, and had stopped drinking alcohol when she became pregnant. On examination, the temperature was 36.3C, the blood pressure 110/64 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. The abdomen was gravid, soft, and nontender, and the fetal heart rate was 130 beats per minute, with accelerations. There was a faint area of lacy, blanching erythema 4 cm in diameter on the right shin and no lymphadenopathy; the remainder of the examination was normal. The red-cell indexes and results of coagulation tests were normal, as were blood levels of creatinine, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total and direct bilirubin, uric acid, and haptoglobin. Thick and thin Giemsa-stained smears of peripheral blood were negative for ba-besia; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was negative. Cultures of the blood were obtained. During the next 4.5 hours, the temperature rose to 38.9C. Ceftriaxone and rifampin were administered. During the next 3 days, results of testing for hepatitis A and B viruses were suggestive of protective immunity, and results of testing for EpsteinBarr virus were suggestive of past infection; testing was negative for cytomegalovirus nucleic acids, HIV, heterophile antibodies, and IgM and IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, Coxiella burnetii, ehrlichia, and anaplasma. The patient became afebrile within 48 hours and her headache resolved on the fourth hospital day. On the fifth hospital day, a diagnostic test result was received.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Borrelia miyamotoi infection and possible Borrelia burgdorferi infection. ", "prediction": "1. Viral illness (e.g., Influenza): The symptoms of fever, chills, headache, myalgia, and fatigue along with the quick resolution after supportive care, are highly consistent with a viral etiological cause.\n2. Lyme disease: Given her travel to a coastal area in Massachusetts and pending Lyme disease test results, it is a strong contender, especially considering the erythematous shin rash.\n3. Toxoplasmosis: Contact with cats and the presence of a faint rash combined with neck stiffness aligns with a possible toxoplasmosis infection, though Toxoplasma gondii serology will be needed.\n4. Parvovirus B19: The patient’s pregnancy and lace-like erythema suggest a potential parvovirus B19 infection, especially given the anemia and her thrombophilia history.\n5. Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever: A history of exposure to outdoor environments where ticks are prevalent, and the presence of a rash and fever, makes this a possibility albeit less common in Massachusetts.\n6. Listeriosis: Given her pregnancy and systemic symptoms with a background of contact with unpasteurized dairy products, listeriosis should be considered although typically presents with gastrointestinal symptoms.\n7. Measles: Presence of rash, fever, and history of missed childhood vaccinations could point towards measles, especially considering the resurgence in certain areas.\n8. Ehrlichiosis: The patient’s history and clinical presentation with headache, fever, and previous tick exposure raise a concern for Ehrlichiosis despite negative initial tests.\n9. Thrombophilia-related complications: Her heterozygosity for factor V Leiden adds the potential for complications that might present with systemic symptoms, although less likely to cause fever.\n10. Viral meningitis: The presence of headache, fever, neck stiffness, and earache suggests possible viral meningitis, though resolution of symptoms without specific antiviral treatment diminishes this likelihood."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Jessica M. Rosenthal Pediatrics: An 8-year-old girl who had required long-term tracheostomy because of airway stenosis caused by an injury in infancy was admitted to this hospital because of a chest-wall mass and a large pleural effusion. The patient was born in China. At 7 months of age, she underwent emergency tracheostomy after a caustic injury from either ingestion or inhalation. At 2.5 years of age, she was adopted by an American family and moved to the United States. Her adoptive parents noted that she had stridor and snoring, and her pediatrician referred her to an otolaryngologist at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary MEEI at 2 years 10 months of age. On examination, the nasopharynx was completely obstructed; there was fusion of the posterior tongue and hard palate and of the hard palate and epiglottis, with a narrow opening in the oropharynx. The supraglottic passage was normal beyond the stenosis; the subglottic airway was not evaluated. A tracheostomy was performed, and the left nasal choanal obstruction was opened with a laser. Repeat bronchoscopy revealed that the larynx and subglottic trachea were normal. On two occasions, esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed no evidence of gastroesophageal reflux. The tracheostomy tube was removed when the patient was 5.5 years of age; there was a residual trachealcutaneous fistula. When she was 7.5 years of age 7 months before this admission, another trache-ostomy was performed because of worsening oropharyngeal stenosis that precluded intubation and because of concern about possible obstruction. The patient had been in her usual state of health until approximately 6.5 weeks before this admission; during a 10-day period, her mother noted recurrent blood-tinged sputum in the tracheostomy tube, and an episode of bleeding at the trache-ostomy site occurred at school. The patient was seen in the emergency department of the MEEI, where a flexible tracheoscopy, which was performed at the bedside after removal of the tracheostomy tube, revealed no exposed blood vessels or granulation tissue in the trachea or stoma. A chest radiograph showed consolidation in the right lower lobe, which was thought to be due to aspiration, pneumonia, or atelectasis. Grams staining of the sputum showed abundant neutrophils, abundant gram-positive cocci in pairs and a few chains, abundant gram-negative diplococci, a few gram-positive rods, and a few thin gram-negative rods. Culture of the sputum from the tracheostomy tube grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Morax-ella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The patient remained afebrile, and no antibiotic agents were administered. She was admitted overnight for observation and discharged home the next day 5 weeks before this admission. She had one more episode of blood-tinged sputum thereafter. During the 2 weeks before this admission, the oxygen saturation, which was obtained during continuous overnight monitoring for sleep apnea, fell to approximately 85 from the usual level of approximately 95 for prolonged periods. Examination at school revealed decreased breath sounds at the base of the right lung. One day before this admission, while the patient was being bathed, her mother noticed that her chest was asymmetric, with the right nipple appearing lower than the left, and that blood vessels were prominent on the right side of the chest. At the pediatricians office the next day, the patient described a recent episode of discomfort in her chest that occurred while she was being hugged. There was no history of respiratory distress, fevers, or cough. On examination, she was tearful and hesitant. The temperature was 36.1C, and a tracheostomy tube was in place. The right lateral chest wall was more prominent than the left, had no crepitus, and was tender to touch. Breath sounds were normal on the left side and diminished on the right. The right upper quadrant of the abdomen was diffusely tender, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The patient was referred to another hospital for chest radiography, which revealed a large pleural effusion on the right side, with underlying pneumonia. The patient was referred to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient had sleep apnea and a history of dental caries that necessitated the extraction of several deciduous teeth between 5 and 7 years of age. Immunizations, including the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine PCV7, were current; she had reportedly received the bacille CalmetteGuerin BCG vaccine at 1 month of age. A purified protein derivative PPD skin test was negative on her arrival in the United States. She took no medications and had no known allergies. She lived at home with her adoptive parents and siblings; she was physically active, did well in school, and was able to breathe, speak, and eat normally, with the tracheostomy tube capped while she was awake. She lived with two dogs and a cat, and the mother smoked outside the home; she had not recently traveled or had contact with ill persons. On examination, the temperature was 37.0C, the blood pressure 102/68 mm Hg, the pulse 135 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 to 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The oropharynx was clear, without erythema or focal lesions. The neck was supple, and the tra-cheostomy site was clean and dry, with an underlying small cavity. Lymphadenopathy with nodes measuring up to 1 cm in diameter in the right anterior cervical chain and a mildly tender right axillary lymph node approximately 1 cm in diameter were present. There were decreased breath sounds at the base of the right lung. There was a bulging area 4 cm by 7 cm on the right lateral chest wall, which was tender on palpation and had no fluctuance or overlying skin changes. The hematocrit, red-cell indexes, and anion gap were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, magnesium, glucose, albumin, amylase, lipase, uric acid, and lactic dehydrogenase and results of renal- and liver-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Randheer Shailam: A frontal chest radiograph that had been obtained 7 months before this admission showed a tracheostomy tube, clear lungs, and no pleural effusion. Frontal, lateral, and bilateral decubitus chest radiographs that were obtained on the day of admission Fig. 1 showed dense air-space opacification in the right lower lung zone, obscuring the right hemidia-phragm and right cardiac border, as well as a large pleural effusion on the right side that tracked along the lateral chest wall, with evidence of locu-lation. The left lung and pleural space were clear. Computed tomography CT of the chest, performed on the same day after the administration of contrast material Fig. 2, revealed asymmetry of the chest wall that was due to multiple heterogeneous soft-tissue masses and thickening of the soft tissue of the right chest wall. Consolidation was present in the right lower lobe and portions of the right middle lobe. Areas of low attenua-tion in the right lower lobe were suggestive of decreased perfusion and possible necrosis. A large loculated pleural effusion, irregularly shaped pa-renchymal nodules in the right upper lobe, prominent enhancing ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes, and subtle periosteal elevation of the medial aspect of the right eighth rib were also present. Dr. Rosenthal: The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. The temperature rose to 38.7C, and acetaminophen was administered, with improvement. On the second hospital day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Empyema necessitatis, with pneumonia of the right lower lobe and empyema of the right pleural cavity caused by actinomyces species. ", "prediction": "1. Tuberculosis: Given the patient's history of BCG vaccination, recent travel history, and the presence of pleural effusion, chest wall masses, and lymphadenopathy, reactivation or primary tuberculosis is plausible.\n2. Empyema: The presence of a large loculated pleural effusion, fever, and areas of consolidation in the lungs suggest a bacterial infection leading to pleural space infection.\n3. Foreign body aspiration: The history of airway issues and tracheostomy may increase the risk of aspiration of foreign material leading to pneumonia and subsequent complications.\n4. Lymphoma: The description of a chest mass, generalized lymphadenopathy, and a pleural effusion could indicate a malignancy such as Hodgkin’s or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.\n5. Chronic lung infection: Given the recurrent respiratory symptoms and infections, a chronic bacterial or fungal infection such as Pseudomonas or Aspergillus could be considered.\n6. Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM): The presence of heterogeneous soft tissue masses and lung consolidation might indicate a congenital malformation that has led to recurrent infections.\n7. Pneumatocele: The history of recurrent infections and airway issues might have led to the development of pneumatocele, causing compression and effusion.\n8. Hemangioma: The soft tissue masses with significant vascular involvement on imaging may suggest the presence of a hemangioma.\n9. Thoracic tumor: The asymmetric chest wall mass and periosteal elevation could point toward a primary thoracic tumor like a neuroblastoma.\n10. Pulmonary sequestration: The development of recurrent pneumonia and consolidation, as well as chest asymmetry, might raise suspicion for pulmonary sequestration."}

Schutzbank Pediatrics: A 9-month-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent fevers with temperatures up to 40.6C during the previous 9 days. The patient had a history of a pelvic kidney and had otherwise been well until approximately 2 months before this admission, in the early spring, when high fevers occurred daily for 5 days, stopped for 4 days, and then recurred for 4 to 5 days. On examination by her pediatrician, a slightly erythematous tympanic membrane was reportedly present, as were labial adhesions, which precluded collection of a urine specimen for analysis or culture. A 10-day course of amoxicillinclavulanate was administered for possible otitis media or urinary tract infection, and the fevers resolved on the third or fourth day of treatment. Nine days before this admission, fever with temperatures up to 40.6C occurred at night, with no other localizing symptoms. The patient was seen by her pediatrician the following day. The evaluation included urinalysis and culture of a urine specimen that was obtained by means of catheterization; these tests were reportedly negative. The fever recurred during the next 4 days, despite alternating treatment with ibuprofen and acetaminophen, and then resolved. Two days before this admission, in the afternoon, the temperature rose again to 40.6C, with associated irritability. The next day, the patient returned to the pediatricians office. On examination, the pharynx was slightly erythematous; the remainder of the examination, including assessment of the tympanic membranes, was normal. Analysis of a urine specimen that was obtained by means of catheterization revealed 1 blood and trace protein and ketones by dipstick. The pediatrician advised the family to take the patient to the emergency department the next day for further evaluation. The parents reported that the patient had decreased oral intake; she drank only sips of breast milk and a rehydration solution with glucose and electrolytes. She did not have a cough, rhinorrhea, vomiting, diarrhea, or a rash. She was born after a full-term gestation. Ultrasonography that had been performed while the patient was in utero had revealed a pelvic left kidney; since birth, she had been monitored by a nephrologist. Her growth and development had been normal, and she was crawling without difficulty during this illness. Her immunizations, including the influenza vaccination, were current; she had taken no medications before this illness and had no known allergies. She lived with her parents, older siblings, and a dog and two cats. She had no exposure to tuberculosis or sick contacts and had not traveled outside the country. Her father had Graves disease, her mother had the polycystic ovary syndrome, her sister had had a urinary tract infection, and her brother had esophageal atresia and tracheomalacia. On examination, the patient was alert, had flushed cheeks, and did not have signs of sepsis. The temperature was 38.1C, the pulse 166 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while she was breathing ambient air; the remainder of the examination was normal. The posterior oro-pharynx could not be visualized. Blood levels of glucose, ferritin, total protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase were normal, as were results of renal-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed 1 ketones and 1 occult blood by dipstick, with 0 to 2 white cells and red cells, few bacteria, and few squamous cells per high-power field and amorphous crystals. Specimens of blood and urine, which were obtained by means of catheterization, were cultured. Screening of the nasal secretions for respiratory viruses was negative. Dr. Randheer Shailam: Frontal and lateral chest radiographs Fig. 1A and 1B show mild pulmonary hyperinflation and mild interstitial opacities, without a focal air-space opacity; these findings are consistent with reactive airway disease, or bronchiolitis. There is no evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumotho-rax. Ultrasound images of the kidneys Fig. 1C and 1D show that the right kidney 7.2 cm in length, in the renal fossa and the left kidney 4.7 cm in length, in the left lower quadrant have a normal appearance. There is no evidence of pyelonephritis, perinephric-fluid collection, abscess, hydronephrosis, or bladder abnormality. Dr. Schutzbank: In the emergency department, the temperature rose to 40.0C. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Examination revealed pharyngeal injection without exudate, a palpable left inguinal lymph node 1 cm in diameter, and normal femoral pulses. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Ceftriaxone and acetaminophen were administered, and crystal-loid solution was infused. A tuberculin skin test was performed. On the first hospital day, the maximum temperature was 39.2C. Approximately 22 hours after presentation, a new symptom developed and additional diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Septic arthritis of the hip. ", "prediction": "1. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Despite normal urinalysis and culture, the recurring high fevers and slightly erythematous tympanic membrane might suggest a low-grade UTI not detected in initial tests.\n2. Viral Infection: The intermittent fever pattern and absence of localized symptoms could indicate a viral etiology, common in pediatric patients.\n3. Kawasaki Disease: The presence of high fever, pharyngeal injection, and palpable lymph node raises the possibility of Kawasaki disease, especially given the prolonged febrile period.\n4. Pelvic Kidney Infection: The child’s history of a pelvic kidney could predispose her to an unusual presentation or site of infection, not immediately apparent on standard imaging or urine tests.\n5. Otitis Media: The erythematous tympanic membrane noticed previously, along with high fever, suggests recurrent or unresolved otitis media.\n6. Sepsis: Although the patient does not show overt signs of sepsis, the high recurrent fevers should warrant consideration and prompt exclusion of a septic process.\n7. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): Given the prolonged and undiagnosed fever, the child fits the criteria for FUO, which requires exclusion of numerous differential diagnoses.\n8. Autoimmune/Inflammatory Condition: The child's family history, especially her father's Graves disease and her mother's polycystic ovary syndrome, could suggest a predisposition to pediatric autoimmune or inflammatory conditions.\n9. Pediatric Malignancy: Though less likely, persistent high fevers without an identifiable source can sometimes be an early sign of a malignancy like leukemia.\n10. Reactive Airway Disease/Bronchiolitis: Radiographic signs of mild pulmonary hyperinflation and interstitial opacities suggest a respiratory condition like reactive airway disease or bronchiolitis, potentially explaining recurrent infections and fevers."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Sahir Kalim Medicine: A 78-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of hypercalcemia and renal failure. The patient had been in his usual health until approximately 4 months before the current admission; he had been admitted to this hospital then because of dyspnea, cough, rib pain, flank pain, and one episode of hematuria that had reportedly occurred 1 week earlier. On examination, the vital signs were normal; there were rales in the bases of both lungs and a systolic ejection murmur grade 26. Urinalysis showed no evidence of blood. Dr. P. Gabriel Peterson: Imaging studies that were performed during that hospitalization included chest radiography and computed tomographic CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. These studies revealed basilar atelectasis, changes consistent with mild congestive heart failure, and a new subpleural nodular opacity 1.3 cm in diameter in the right middle lobe Fig. 1A. There was also bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with coarse calcifications, a finding that was unchanged from imaging studies that had been obtained 2 years earlier Fig. 1B. Dr. Kalim: During that admission, the patients cough, dyspnea, and flank pain improved with supportive care. At discharge, recommendations included outpatient follow-up with CT of the chest, cytologic examination of a urine specimen, and possible cystoscopy. Four months later, on the day of the current admission, the patient was seen in a clinic affiliated with this hospital for a follow-up visit. He reported that two episodes of hematuria had occurred during the previous 2 months, with fatigue but no fevers, chills, numbness, headache, neck stiffness, difficulty swallowing, incontinence, trauma, or infection. He had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, benign prostatic hypertrophy, mild cognitive decline, and choreiform movements. He had undergone aortic-valve replacement and repair of an aortic aneurysm 2 years earlier; he had had a positive tuberculin skin test with a reportedly negative evaluation 6 years earlier. His medications included donepezil hydrochloride, citalopram, tamsulosin, ranitidine, quetiapine, aspirin, psyllium, and a multivitamin. He had no known allergies. He was born in Europe and had lived in South America for 10 years; he had immigrated to the United States when he was in his 40s. He lived with his wife and was retired after working in the construction and food industries. He maintained a low-salt and low-cholesterol diet, had stopped smoking 30 years earlier, had stopped drinking alcohol 1 month earlier, and did not use illicit drugs. His father had had asthma and a myocardial infarction at 62 years of age, his mother had had heart failure in her 70s, a brother had had a stroke in his 80s, and his son had died in his 30s because of arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy; his other children were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 108//66 mm Hg, and the pulse 68 beats per minute. The first and second heart sounds were normal; a systolic murmur, grade 1/6, was heard at the left base. The remainder of the examination was unchanged from baseline. The platelet count and red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed clear yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.009, a pH of 5.5, and trace albumin by dipstick, and was otherwise normal. After the test results were known, the patient was advised to go the emergency department of this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient reported diffuse nonradiating lower abdominal pain, which he rated at 4 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain).  He also reported severe constipation, increasing urinary frequency over a period of 1 week, decreased oral intake, weakness and fatigue of 1 month’s duration, and weight loss of 4.5 kg during the previous 3 months.  He had no fevers, chills, night sweats, cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rashes, chest pain, palpitations, syncope, or leg swelling.  On examination, the blood pressure was 149//65 mm Hg, the pulse 50 beats per minute, the temperature 36.4°C, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air.  The abdomen was soft and mildly tender in the lower quadrants, without rebound, and the remainder of the examination was unchanged.  Blood levels of lactate dehydrogenase and vitamin A were normal, and testing was negative for hepatitis B virus surface antibodies and antigen and hepatitis C virus antibodies;  additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.  Repeat urinalysis revealed 1+ occult blood and albumin by dipstick;  examination of the urinary sediment revealed 0 to 2 red cells and white cells, few bacteria, and few squamous cells per high-power field.  The urinary sodium level was 55 mmol per liter, the creatinine level was 0.44 mg per milliliter (3890 μmol per liter), and the osmolality was 329 mOsm per kilogram of water.  A chest radiograph revealed a tortuous calcified aorta, evidence of aortic-valve replacement, and no evidence of pneumonia or effusion.  Electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 50 beats per minute;  the results were otherwise unchanged from earlier tracings.  The patient was admitted to this hospital.  Normal saline was infused, and salmon calcitonin was administered.  The calcium level decreased to 13.4 mg per deciliter (3.35 mmol per liter), at which time the ionized calcium level was 1.73 mmol per liter (6.92 mg per deciliter;  reference range, 1.14 to 1.30 mmol per liter [4.56 to 5.20 mg per deciliter]).  Two additional liters of saline were infused.  On the second day, hemodialysis was performed, and the ionized calcium level decreased to 1.27 mmol per liter (5.08 mg per deciliter).  The next day, pamidronate was administered.  Dr. Peterson: During the next 8 days, additional imaging studies were obtained.  CT of the chest, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed multiple small pulmonary nodules, many of which were subpleural (Figure 1C).  The nodules were unchanged from imaging studies obtained 2 years earlier, and the new nodule in the right middle lobe that had been seen on the previous study had resolved.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed a right renal cyst (2.9 cm in diameter) and an enlarged prostate.  A bone scan showed no evidence of bone metastases.  Thyroid ultrasonography revealed bilateral colloid cysts but no extrathyroid nodules.  A skeletal survey showed diffuse osteopenia, with lucent lesions in the calvarium and possibly the mandible, as well as subtle, indeterminate lucent lesions in the legs that raised concerns about multiple myeloma or metastatic cancer.  Dr. Kalim: Cytologic examination and culture of the urine were negative.  On the sixth hospital day, testing for cryoproteins was negative.  Pathological examination of a bone marrow–biopsy specimen showed 7% plasma cells and an increased number of monoclonal plasma cells with kappa light chains.  The patient was discharged on the 11th hospital day;  sodium bicarbonate was added to his previous medication regimen.  Eleven days later (21 days after the current admission), at an outpatient visit, additional test results were obtained (Table 1). Dr. Peterson: The next week, 1 month after the current admission, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) revealed marked FDG avidity in the mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy (Figure 1D).  Dr. Kalim: Two weeks later, the patient was readmitted to this hospital because of worsening renal failure.  Levels of complement (C3 and C4) were normal, and testing was negative for antibodies to double-stranded DNA, SSA (Ro), SSB (La), Sm, and RNP;  other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.  A renal biopsy was performed. Dr. Eugene J. Mark: Pathological examination of the renal-biopsy specimen revealed two glomeruli with global sclerosis (out of the six examined), interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy affecting 30% of the cortex. The principal finding was a focal but dense infiltrate of mononuclear cells that was composed predominantly of lymphocytes, with some histiocytes and plasma cells and without eosinophils. There were foci of tubulitis that was characterized by disruption of basement membrane by the inflammatory cells (Figure 2A). Interstitial fibrosis resulted in tubular atrophy (Figure 2B). These findings indicate chronic active tubulointerstitial nephritis. In addition, localized collections of histiocytes were present. The epithelioid character of the histiocytes, as well as their circumscription, can be described as granulomatous or as poorly formed granulomas (Figure 2C).1 The glomeruli that were observed in the renal-biopsy specimen were normal apart from the global sclerosis in areas of inflammation (Figure 2D). Dr. Kalim: The patient was discharged on the fourth hospital day. Four weeks later, a diagnostic procedure was performed. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Sarcoidosis. ", "prediction": "1. Multiple Myeloma: The presence of monoclonal plasma cells with kappa light chains in the bone marrow biopsy and osteopenia with lucent bone lesions suggest multiple myeloma.\n2. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy: The patient's severe hypercalcemia and evidence of systemic involvement, such as pulmonary nodules and enlarged lymph nodes, raise the possibility of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia.\n3. Primary Hyperparathyroidism: Persistent hypercalcemia and normal vitamin D levels could indicate primary hyperparathyroidism, although no parathyroid pathology was noted on imaging.\n4. Tubulointerstitial Nephritis: Histopathological findings from the renal biopsy demonstrating dense infiltrate of mononuclear cells and tubulitis are indicative of chronic active tubulointerstitial nephritis.\n5. Sarcoidosis: The presence of granulomatous inflammation in the kidney biopsy, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy with FDG avidity, and multiple pulmonary nodules suggest sarcoidosis as a differential.\n6. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient’s history of renal failure, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy observed in the renal biopsy are consistent with CKD.\n7. Metastatic Cancer: Lucent bone lesions, hypercalcemia, and multiple pulmonary nodules could point towards metastatic cancer, even though no primary tumor has been identified.\n8. Granulomatous Nephritis: The granulomas found in the kidney biopsy suggest that granulomatous nephritis, potentially related to an underlying systemic granulomatous disease, is a possibility.\n9. Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN): The renal biopsy findings of lymphocytic infiltration and tubulitis are also typical of acute interstitial nephritis.\n10. Tuberculosis: Given the patient's positive tuberculin skin test in the past and the findings of granulomatous inflammation in the kidney biopsy, renal tuberculosis remains a consideration."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Blair Wylie Obstetrics and Gynecology: A 38-year-old pregnant woman gravida 2, para 0 was admitted to this hospital at 33 weeks 3 days of gestation because of headache and visual symptoms. The patient had been in her usual health until 2 weeks before admission, when neck pain developed. Eleven days before admission, she was seen in the emergency department and the labor and delivery unit because of neck and back pain, occipital headache, vomiting, and a self-reported temperature of 38.9C. On examination, the back was tender; the vital signs and remainder of the examination were normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed yellow, cloudy urine, with trace ketones, 1 albumin, and 2 urobilinogen; urine sediment showed a few squamous cells per high-power field and mucin. Hydromorphone and cyclobenzaprine were administered, with some improvement. The patient was discharged home. A urine culture grew abundant mixed bacteria, with small amounts of two potential pathogens. The headache improved spontaneously after 3 days. On the day of presentation, the patient felt the onset of a panic attack followed by tunnel vision; she began to hyperventilate and her vision went black from the periphery to the center. The symptoms lasted for approximately 2 minutes and were followed by spots in her visual fields, headache, neck pain that radiated to her arms, nausea, and dizziness both unsteadiness and vertigo. The capillary glucose level, which was obtained by the patient, was 122 mg per deciliter 6.8 mmol per liter. She called her caregivers and was advised to go to the labor and delivery unit. On presentation, the patient reported normal fetal movement and no fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, leaking fluid, or contractions. She had received prenatal care, including screenings for syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, gonorrhea, and chlamydia all of which were negative and routine ultrasound examinations. During the third trimester, a glucose-tolerance test was positive. She had intermittent atypical chest pain that had lasted for several years; 2.5 months before admission, an evaluation of the pain included electrocardiography ECG, which revealed nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes, and trans-thoracic echocardiography, which was normal. At 17 years of age, she had presented at 20 weeks of gestation with sepsis and a stillborn fetus; dilation and evacuation had been performed. She also had anemia Table 1 with a history of iron deficiency, bipolar disorder, panic attacks associated with syncope and tingling on the left side, recurrent pelvic pain with pelvic adhesions, benign ovarian cysts, asthma, and seasonal allergic rhinitis; she had had a positive purified protein derivative skin test with a normal chest radiograph, which had been treated with isoniazid and vitamin B6  for 9 months. She had undergone multiple laparoscopies, including cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis, lysis of adhesions, and ovarian cystectomies. Medications included a prenatal multivitamin and ferrous sulfate; antidepressants were discontinued by the patient at the start of the current pregnancy. She was allergic to loperamide, morphine which caused chest discomfort, meperidine hydrochloride which caused hives, and contrast material which caused a rash. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was born in Guatemala, had immigrated to the United States 15 years earlier, and had last visited Guatemala 3 years earlier. She lived with her boyfriend. She had worked in an office but was currently receiving disability benefits because of her bipolar disorder. Her mother had had breast cancer and died in her 50s. On examination, the temperature was 35.9C, the blood pressure 117/68 mm Hg, the pulse 104 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. Her abdomen was gravid, soft, and nontender, with active fetal movements. The fetal heart-rate tracing was reassuring. There was no peripheral edema or abdominal tenderness. Reflexes were normal, as were the remaining general and neurologic examinations. The capillary glucose level was 111 mg per deciliter 6.2 mmol per liter. Blood levels of uric acid, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, globulin, and total and direct bilirubin were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, and butal-bitalacetaminophencaffeine were administered, followed by prochlorperazine, oxycodoneacet-aminophen, and diphenhydramine; the patients condition partially improved. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head could not be performed because of the patients anxiety; preliminary magnetic resonance venography showed no evidence of sinus thrombosis. After 24 hours of observation in the labor and delivery unit, the patients symptoms had not resolved, and she was admitted to the hospital. She reported occipital headache, which she rated at 9 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain. Dr. Ramon Gilberto Gonzalez: Later that day, MRI of the head was performed without the administration of contrast material Fig. 1A and 1B. Diffusion-weighted images showed multiple at least eight small hyperintense lesions scattered throughout both cerebral hemispheres, in white and gray matter; the largest lesion 7 mm in maximal diameter was located in the left cen-trum semiovale, with no evidence of associated intracranial mass or hemorrhage. The lesions were thought to reflect infarcts that had occurred at least 6 hours earlier. Results of magnetic resonance angiography and venography were normal. Dr. Wylie: Ultrasonography of the legs revealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. ECG showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 108 beats per minute and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes. Holter monitoring did not reveal an arrhythmia. A lumbar puncture was unsuccessful; the patient declined further attempts. Aspirin 81 mg daily, metoclopramide, and prenatal vitamins were administered. On the third day, the prothrombin time, prothrombin-time international normalized ratio, and activated partial-thromboplastin time were normal, as were results of tests for factor VIII, partial-thromboplastin timelupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgG and IgM antibodies, functional antithrombin III, functional protein C, activated protein C resistance, and prothrombin gene mutation; other test results are shown in Table 1. Betamethasone was administered in two 12-mg intramusclar doses 24 hours apart to promote fetal lung maturity. An active, well-grown fetus was seen on ultrasound examination. The patients headache resolved. The next day, on evaluation by ophthalmology consultants, she reported no acute change in vision, eye pain, or eye redness, but she did have floaters, which she described as worms. On examination, there was binocular horizontal diplopia which could be relieved with the use of corrective lenses and a pterygium on the left side, with no evidence of papilledema, embolic phenomena, or vasculitis on funduscopic examination. Testing revealed antibodies to hepatitis A virus; screening for hepatitis B and C viruses was negative. Dr. Gonzalez: Repeat MRI of the head Fig. 1C revealed multiple foci of restricted diffusion, including a few that were new in the bilateral frontal and right occipital lobes. These findings were thought to be consistent with multiple small acute infarcts. Dr. David M. Dudzinski: On the fifth day, trans-thoracic echocardiography Fig. 2; and Videos 1, 2, and 3, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org revealed a hyperkinetic left ventricle without wall-motion abnormalities and with obliteration of the left ventricular cavity during systole. The right ventricular apex was akinetic and aneurysmal. In both ventricles, there was prominent accumulation of sessile, smooth-bordered endocardial material with an echodensity that was distinctly different from that of the myocardium; this finding was not present on the previous echocardiogram. Thrombus in the left ventricle would be unlikely in this case given the diffuse accumulation of endocardial material and the absence of global or regional dysfunction. Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy could produce a hyperkinetic ventricle with obliteration of the left ventricular cavity during systole but not one in which the wall has an echodensity that is different from that of the myocardium. Thus, the findings were suggestive of endocar-dial deposits. There was no patent foramen ovale or clinically significant valvulopathy specifically no valvular thickening, vegetations, tethering, or malcoaptation and only trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Tissue Doppler echocardiography, Doppler assessment of the transmitral flow velocity and pulmonary-vein flow velocity, and assessment of the color M-mode propagation velocity revealed that the left ventricular diastolic function was normal. Dr. Wylie: Consultations with the infectious diseases, hematology, and rheumatology services were requested. The level of lipoproteina was normal, and testing was negative for antibodies to 2-glycoprotein 1, SSA Ro, SSB La, Sm, and RNP and for IgG antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides. A continuous intravenous infusion of heparin was initiated. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.

Central venous thrombosis: While preliminary MR venography showed no evidence of sinus thrombosis, this condition can occasionally present with similar symptoms, especially in pregnant women.\n5. Severe migraine: Given her history of occipital headache with visual disturbances and her response to pain medications, a severe migraine or migraine with aura should be considered.\n6. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM): The echocardiographic findings of a hyperkinetic left ventricle and abnormal echodensity could suggest HCM, contributing to systemic embolization and multiple infarcts.\n7. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE): Despite negative tests, undiagnosed or early SLE could present with neurologic symptoms and microinfarcts, especially given her array of systemic symptoms and history of autoimmune indicators.\n8. Primary Antiphospholipid syndrome: Though initial screening was negative, recurrent small strokes could be indicative of this condition, which could be exacerbated during pregnancy.\n9. Panic Attack/Anxiety: Given her history of bipolar disorder and panic attacks, her episode of hyperventilation and subsequent tunnel vision could be attributed to a psychosomatic or anxiety-related episode.\n10.

A diagnosis of dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy had been made when the patient was in his late 40s. When he was 48 years of age, a dual-chamber pacemaker and implantable cardioverterdefibrillator ICD was placed. Dr. Jodi L. Zilinski Echocardiology: Four months before admission, transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40 Fig. 1A, 1B, and 1C; and Videos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Dr. Herrington: Several days before admission, malaise, fatigue, increasing dys-pnea, and chest tightness developed. One day before admission, the patient was seen by his primary care provider. The systolic blood pressure was reportedly between 80 and 89 mm Hg, the pulse higher than 100 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 77 while he was breathing ambient air. Emergency medical services were called; on examination, the patients mentation was normal, and the cardiac rhythm was rapid atrial fibrillation. During transport by ambulance to another hospital, ventricular tachycardia developed, and the patient became unresponsive and apneic. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun, and the trachea was intubated. In the emergency department, blood levels of magnesium and alkaline phosphatase were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Ventricular tachycardia was followed by transient pulseless electrical activity, with hypoten-sion, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis. Oxygen, multiple external shocks, epinephrine, amiodarone, dopamine, and sodium bicarbonate were administered. After approximately 25 minutes, atrial fibrillation was restored, and the blood pressure rose to 98/20 mm Hg. Norepinephrine bitartrate, insulin, midazolam, cisatracurium, furosemide, fentanyl, vasopressin, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium, calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, potassium phosphate, heparin, and normal saline were administered. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit ICU. Dr. Zilinski: Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15, severe diffuse hypokinesis, regional wall-motion abnormalities, mild left ventricular dilatation, normal wall thickness, and moderate mitral regurgitation, without pericardial effusion. Dr. Herrington: Chest radiographs reportedly showed increasing consolidation of the right middle and upper lobes. The patient was paralyzed, and mechanical ventilation was continued. Furosemide and chlorothiazide were administered for oliguria, and broad-spectrum antibiotic agents for presumed aspiration pneu-monia; venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO was initiated for persistent hypoxemia. On the second day, the patient was transferred to this hospital and admitted to the ICU. Medications on transfer included norepi-nephrine, dopamine, fentanyl, midazolam, vaso-pressin, insulin, and cisatracurium. The patient had muscle weakness that had begun approximately 15 years earlier, when increasing weakness of his hands developed. When the patient was 40 years of age, episodes of lightheadedness occurred; a diagnosis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was made, and prophylactic anticoagulation with warfarin was begun. When he was 41 years of age, he noted difficulty walking with occasional stumbling, gripping and releasing tools, and climbing stairs and ladders. Electromyography, which was performed at another hospital, reportedly revealed brief-duration, low-amplitude, polyphasic motor-unit potentials. During the next 3 years, his symptoms worsened, and his left forearm was fractured after a fall. On examination when the patient was 44 years of age, extraocular movements were normal, and mild bilateral ptosis, moderate bilateral facial weakness, and slight thinning of the tem-poralis muscles were present. His speech had a nasal quality, without dysarthria or tongue weakness. The muscle weakness was rated as 4 on the Medical Research Council MRC scale which ranges from 0 paralysis to 5 normal strength and involved the neck flexors, finger extensors, and intrinsic muscles of the hands; strength was normal in the proximal muscles of the arms. Muscle tone was normal throughout. After the patient firmly grasped the examiners hand, he had difficulty releasing his grip quickly. Tapping of the finger extensor muscles on the dorsal forearm and on the abductor pollicis in the thenar eminence produced muscle contractions that relaxed slowly. There was slight weakness of the hip flexor muscles, normal strength in the quadriceps and hamstrings, and weakness of the dorsiflexors MRC score, 3 and plantar flexors MRC score, 4 of the feet. The patient was able to point to a target with his fingertip, perform the heelkneeshin test, and carry out rapid, rhythmic tapping movements with his hands and feet. Vibration sense was mildly decreased in his toes. He rose from a chair without the use of his arms and had a high-stepping gait. Deep-tendon reflexes were hypoactive in the arms and absent at the ankles. Rombergs sign was absent. Over the course of the next few years, weakness progressed. When the patient was 47 years of age, he had difficulty lifting 5-gallon buckets at work; examination reportedly revealed weakness of the neck flexors MRC score, 4, wrist and finger extensors MRC scores, 4, and finger flexors and distal leg muscles MRC scores, 3 and normal strength in the deltoid, biceps, triceps, hip flex-ors, quadriceps, and hamstrings. Deep-tendon reflexes were absent. The patient also had obstructive sleep apnea, sudden sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear which had begun when he was 45 years of age and which was unresponsive to glucocorticoid therapy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, morbid obesity, cho-lelithiasis which had required cholecystectomy, problems with ejaculation, noninsulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, depression, vitamin B12 and vitamin D deficiencies, and episodes of pneumonia that were thought to be related to aspiration. Medications that he was taking before this acute illness included warfarin, pravastatin, pioglitazone, met-formin, ketoconazole, atenolol, citalopram, furo-semide, pantoprazole, and bupropion all daily, as well as a vitamin B12 supplement monthly and a vitamin D supplement weekly. He reportedly had allergies to morphine, codeine, and tramadol. He was married and lived with his wife and children. He worked in a retail store. He drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke. His father and one sister had an undefined neuromuscular problem. His father had had lung cancer, and his mother uterine cancer; both died when they were in their 70s. One of his children had scoliosis and a neuromuscular disorder similar to that of the patient. On examination, the patient was sedated and paralyzed. Coarse breath sounds in the lungs and active bowel sounds were present. There was trace edema of both legs, and the abdomen was soft and nondistended. The pupils were sluggishly reactive; oculocephalic and corneal reflexes were absent. The arms and legs had minimal withdrawal and possible posturing. The blood levels of magnesium and amylase were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Sodium bicarbonate, insulin, glucose solution, and furose-mide were administered, and urine output increased 450 mm3 of urine over a 2-hour period. A cannula was placed for distal perfusion, and ECMO was continued. Dr. Stacey Verzosa: A chest radiograph Fig. 2 showed bilateral diffuse consolidation that was most confluent in the left lower lung, an enlarged cardiac silhouette, bilateral layering pleu-ral effusions, and the presence of medical devices, including a dual-chamber pacemaker and ICD and an ECMO catheter. Dr. Herrington: Electroencephalography revealed alternation of low-amplitude bursts with near-complete suppression of cerebral activity. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration was begun, without improvement in neurologic function. Overnight, multiple units of red cells and fresh-frozen plasma were transfused, and albumin was administered. Heparin, insulin, vaso-pressin, and norepinephrine were administered. Results of a cosyntropin stimulation test were normal. On the second day, computed tomography of the head revealed no evidence of hemorrhage or mass lesions. Dr. Zilinski: Repeat transthoracic echocardiog-raphy revealed severe diffuse left ventricular hy-pokinesis, with regional variation and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 13 Fig. 1D, 1E, and 1F; and Videos 3 and 4. Dr. Herrington: Fentanyl and midazolam were discontinued, and hydrocortisone was administered, without improvement in the patients level of consciousness. Portable electroencephalogra-phy revealed generalized slowing with near-total suppression of cerebral activity and without evidence of epileptiform abnormalities. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. On the fifth hospital day, in consultation with the patients family, mechanical respiratory support was withdrawn and comfort measures were instituted; shortly thereafter, the patient died.

Blumenthal Medicine: A 29-year-old man with metastatic thymoma was seen in the outpatient oncology clinic of this hospital because of intractable diarrhea of 1 months duration. The patient had received a diagnosis of thymoma at another hospital 5 years earlier, after a chest radiograph had been obtained to evaluate acute pain in the left shoulder. Dr. Florian J. Fintelmann: The chest radiograph showed a large mediastinal mass and left pleural effusion Fig. 1A. Subsequent computed tomographic CT scans showed an anterior mediastinal soft-tissue mass that measured 10.0 cm craniocau-dally, 10.1 cm transversely, and 5.0 cm anteroposteriorly Fig. 1B, as well as left pleural soft-tissue nodules, a pleural effusion, and associated atelectasis Fig. 1C. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography revealed uptake in the me-diastinal mass and left pleural nodules that was suggestive of pleural metastases. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head was unremarkable. Dr. Lawrence R. Zukerberg: Flexible bronchoscopy with video-assisted thoracoscop-ic evaluation of the left lung and pleural space was performed. Pleural-biopsy specimens showed nests of epithelioid tumor cells, some with numerous admixed lymphocytes separated by thick, hyalinized fibrous bands Fig. 2; these features are diagnostic of type B2 thymoma, with areas of type B3 thymoma. Flow cytom-etry revealed immature T cells that were consistent with thymocytes. Dr. Blumenthal: Levels of human chorionic gonadotropin and alpha-fetoprotein were normal. A chemotherapy regimen of doxorubicin, cisplatin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide was administered for three cycles, and then a thymectomy was performed. Dr. Zukerberg: The resection specimen was a yellow, necrotic mass that measured 6.5 cm by 5.0 cm by 3.0 cm; no viable tumor was seen on microscopic examination. No measurable disease was present in the pleura. Dr. Blumenthal: Thirteen months after the patients initial presentation, follow-up CT of the chest revealed new nodular left pleural thickening, a finding that was suggestive of metastatic disease. Thereafter, the patient was monitored with serial scanning. Approximately 2.5 years before this presentation, episodes of nonproductive cough developed that persisted for a few minutes at a time and were occasionally associated with vom-iting and pain in the right lateral chest wall; there was no dyspnea at rest. Dr. Zukerberg: Pathological examination of a core-needle biopsy specimen of the left pleura confirmed the presence of metastatic thymoma. A multiplexed polymerase-chain-reaction assay followed by single-base extension analysis revealed no mutations in any of the 68 tested loci from 14 cancer-associated genes see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Dr. Blumenthal: Additional chemotherapy with doxorubicin, cisplatin, vincristine, and cyclo-phosphamide was administered, followed by sunitinib; there was transient improvement in the cough. The treatment course was complicated by several episodes of fever and cough at least three of which were documented as bacterial pneumonia and intermittent oral thrush. Six months before this presentation, treatment with an investigational agent  a selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase PI3K isoform   was begun. At the end of the second and fourth cycles of therapy, restaging scans showed stable disease. Four weeks before this presentation, at the end of the fifth cycle, diarrhea developed, and episodes increased in frequency to 10 to 12 liquid stools daily, each with an average volume of 250 ml; there was occasional nausea and vomiting, despite administration of loperamide hydrochloride, a solution of deodorized tincture of opium 10 mg of morphine equivalent per 1 ml of solvent, and di-phenoxylateatropine. Stool color reportedly varied in relation to oral intake; there was no abdominal pain, hematochezia, or melena. Dr. Fintelmann: Thirteen days before this presentation, CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed mild circumferential wall thickening of the sigmoid colon and prominence of the vasa recta, findings that were suggestive of inflammation Fig. 1D. Enlarging celiac lymphade-nopathy was suggestive of progression of metastatic disease. CT of the chest that was performed on the same day revealed that the pleural and pulmonary nodules had not changed; these findings were consistent with stable thoracic metastases Fig. 1E. Dr. Blumenthal: The blood uric acid level was 11.4 mg per deciliter 678 mol per liter; reference range, 3.6 to 8.5 mg per deciliter 214 to 506 mol per liter. The investigational agent was stopped after a total of five cycles of therapy, without subsequent improvement in diarrhea. Six days later, 1 week before this presentation, testing of a stool specimen for Clostridium difficile was negative, and a stool culture did not grow any enteric pathogens. One week later, the patient was seen in the outpatient oncology clinic of this hospital because of persistent diarrhea. He reported slight nausea without vomiting, fever, or chills, as well as poor appetite, increased fatigue, persistent chest-wall pain, nocturnal headaches, dyspnea when climbing stairs, and dryness of the lips and mouth and the skin of his hands. He had lost 9 kg of weight in the past month. Medications were allopurinol, a solution of deodorized tincture of opium 0.6 ml four times daily, hy-dromorphone, guaifenesin, diphenoxylateatro-pine, potassium chloride, and, as needed, benzo-natate for cough. He was allergic to vancomycin and omeprazole. He worked in a retail setting. He did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His paternal grandfather had had cancer, possibly of the prostate; other family history was noncontributory. On examination, the vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. The abdomen was soft, with slight tenderness on deep palpation of the upper right quadrant and without guarding or rebound. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, platelet count, and plasma anion gap were normal, as were the blood levels of glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, magnesium, uric acid, phosphorus, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and lactic dehydrogenase and results of renal-function tests. Nucleic acid testing for cyto-megalovirus was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Diagnostic procedures were performed.

Hundemer Medicine: A 57-year-old man was admitted to the medical intensive care unit ICU of this hospital in the winter because of severe pneumonia and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient had been well until 21 days before this admission, when myalgias, arthralgias, chills, fever with a temperature of 39.2C, and upper respiratory symptoms occurred. Seven days later, he was seen by his physician because of worsening symptoms. A rapid test for influenza virus was reportedly negative. A diagnosis of possible influenza was made, and supportive care was advised. The next day, he was seen in the emergency department of another hospital. A chest radiograph reportedly showed evidence of pneumonia in the left upper lobe. Ceftriaxone and azithromycin were administered intravenously, azithromycin and an albuterol inhaler were prescribed, and the patient was discharged home. Two days later, 11 days before this admission, the patient called his physician because of persistent symptoms; prednisone and cough syrup were prescribed. After 2 more days, he was seen by an infectious-disease specialist in the outpatient clinic of another hospital. He reported exhaustion, fever with a temperature of 38.9C despite having taken acetaminophen, and cough with blood-tinged sputum and pleuritic chest pain that prevented him from sleeping. On examination, he had dys-pnea. The blood pressure was 148/71 mm Hg, the pulse between 88 and 120 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94 while he was breathing ambient air at rest. There were crackles at the left lung base and left axillary region. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph revealed a dense infiltrate on the left side. A diagnosis of severe community-acquired pneumonia was made, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. Ceftriaxone and moxifloxacin were administered. Dr. Jeanne B. Ackman: Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs that were obtained 6 days before this admission Fig. 1A and 1B showed severe consolidation in the left upper lobe, relatively mild consolidation in the right upper lobe, a trace left pleural effusion, and no obvious lymphadenopathy. Subsequent portable an-teroposterior chest radiographs that were obtained during the next 5 days Fig. 1C revealed further opacification of the left lung, with predominant involvement of the upper lobe, and worsening multifocal consolidation in the right lung that was most severe in the right upper lobe. Dr. Hundemer: Vancomycin therapy was initiated on the third day at the other hospital, and imi-penem therapy was initiated on the fifth day. On the sixth day 4 days before admission to this hospital, hypoxemia occurred, and an increasing amount of supplemental oxygen was required. The level of 1-antitrypsin was 270 mg per deciliter reference range, 93 to 209. The anion gap and blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, IgG, and IgM were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was transferred to the medical ICU. Bronchoscopic examination revealed purulent secretions, without mucous plugs or masses. Cultures of sputum specimens were negative. Echocardiography revealed normal biventricular function and wall motion, and the left ventricular ejection fraction was 60 to 65. On the ninth day at the other hospital, bilevel positive airway pressure was administered, with some improvement. Later that day, the trachea was electively intubated and methyl-prednisolone was administered. Cultures of the sputum grew candida species; blood cultures were negative. On the 10th day at the other hospital, the patient was transferred by helicopter to this hospital according to his familys wishes and admitted to the medical ICU. Medications at the time of transfer were fentanyl, midazolam, and norepi-nephrine by intravenous infusions, as well as vecuronium, imipenem, moxifloxacin, vancomycin, pantoprazole, ondansetron, methylprednisolone, sodium succinate, acetaminophen, enoxaparin, albuterol by nebulizer, fluticasone nasal spray, and nystatin suspension. The patient had gout, for which he took indo-methacin as needed. He had received an influenza vaccination earlier that season. He had no known allergies. He was married, had adult children, and lived in a semirural area of New England. He worked in manufacturing and had traveled for work to Indonesia and Japan during the month before this admission and to northern New England and the region surrounding the St. Lawrence River basin frequently during the previous year. His coworkers had not been ill. He reportedly did not participate in outdoor sports activities. He had a history of 40 pack-years of smoking and had stopped smoking 6 months before this admission; he drank alcohol infrequently and did not use illicit drugs. His mother and sister had 1-antitrypsin deficiency, his mother had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and his father had died at 63 years of age from myocardial infarction. On examination, the patient was intubated, sedated, and afebrile. The blood pressure was 89/22 mm Hg, the pulse 50 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute while he was receiving ventilatory support. There were coarse breath sounds bilaterally and diffuse 2 edema of the arms and legs; the heart sounds and abdomen were normal. The plasma anion gap and results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal, as were blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, total and direct bilirubin, globulin, amylase, lipase, IgG, IgM, C3, and C4; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed cloudy, yellow urine, with 1 albumin and 2 urobilinogen by dipstick. There were 5 to 10 red cells, 3 to 5 white cells, a few squamous cells, very few transitional cells, and very few renal tubular cells per high-power field, 20 to 100 hyaline casts and 20 to 100 granular casts per low-power field, and mucin. Dr. Ackman: A chest radiograph that was obtained at the time of admission to this hospital revealed placement of endotracheal and esopha-gogastric tubes. There was a further increase in severe bilateral multifocal consolidation, without pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion Fig. 1D. Dr. Hundemer: The fraction of inspired oxygen Fio2 was increased to 1.00, and the partial pressure of arterial oxygen Pao2 rose to 93 mm Hg, with an oxygen saturation of 95. Methylpred-nisolone, meropenem, and continuous infusions of fentanyl, vasopressin, and propofol were administered; imipenem was discontinued. Grams staining of a sputum specimen revealed a moderate amount of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and no organisms; testing for antigens to adeno-virus, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus was negative, as was nucleic acid testing for influenza A and B viruses. Diagnostic procedures were performed.

Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia: Given the patient's initial presentation with fever, chills, myalgias, cough, pleuritic chest pain, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia, this remains the most plausible primary diagnosis.\n2. Influenza Pneumonia: Despite negative influenza tests, the clinical picture and initial presumptive diagnosis suggest a potential influenza infection that was not detected by rapid tests.\n3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's history of cough with blood-tinged sputum and rapidly worsening pneumonia could reflect aspiration, particularly with the left upper lobe involvement.\n4. COVID-19 Pneumonia: Despite negative influenza testing, a viral etiology like COVID-19 should be considered given the respiratory failure and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.\n5. Fungal Pneumonia: The presence of candida species in sputum culture and severe consolidation in the lungs indicate a potential fungal infection.\n6. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient’s acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and mucus-containing erythrocytes on examination could suggest a pulmonary embolism.\n7. Legionnaire's Disease: The patient’s travel history and severe pneumonia symptoms, especially with bilateral infiltrates and systemic symptoms, are indicative of Legionella infection.\n8. Interstitial Lung Disease: The patient’s worsening multifocal consolidation despite appropriate antibiotics raises the question of an underlying or overlapping interstitial lung process.\n9. Tuberculosis: Given the patient's persistent symptoms and multi-lobar involvement, tuberculosis remains a differential to consider, particularly with a recent history of travel to endemic areas.\n10.

Gockley Obstetrics and Gynecology: A 57-year-old woman was seen in the outpatient gynecology clinic of this hospital because of hirsutism, hair loss on the scalp, and deepening of her voice. One month before this presentation, the patient was seen at the outpatient gynecology clinic of another hospital. She reported a 3-year history of hair growth on her face, as well as a 1-year history of prominent symptoms, including increased hair growth on her abdomen, hair loss primarily on the top of her head, deepening of her voice, growth of skin tags on her neck and breast, and an increased libido. Laboratory testing revealed elevated total and free testosterone levels and a normal dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate DHEAS level. A Papanicolaou test was negative for intraepithelial lesions and cancer, and testing for high-risk human papillomavirus was negative. Twenty-one days before this presentation, the patient was seen at a second hospital by an endocrinologist, who completed an evaluation and ordered a comprehensive panel of laboratory tests to evaluate her hyperandrogenism. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Five days later, a 24-hour urine collection contained 6.0 g of cortisol reference range, 3.5 to 45.0 in a 1050-ml sample. One week later, computed tomography CT of the abdomen was performed and revealed diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver without focal hepatic lesions, a nonob-structing stone 3 mm in diameter, with a density of approximately 300 Houn-sfield units in the interpolar region of the right kidney, surgical clips in the gallbladder fossa that were consistent with cholecystectomy, and degenerative changes in the visualized skeleton, with no splenomegaly, adrenal nodules, or lymphadenopathy. After these imaging and laboratory evaluations were performed, the patient was seen in the outpatient gynecology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. The patient was gravida 3, para 3, with normal pregnancies; menses had begun at 12 years of age and had occurred every 40 to 60 days thereafter until menopause, which had occurred 3 years before this presentation. Postmenopausal bleeding had recently occurred. In addition, the patient had hypothyroidism, hypertension, interstitial cystitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, degenerative osteoar-thritis for which multiple glucocorticoid injections had been administered to the knees, carpal tunnel syndrome, vitamin D deficiency, an erythematous rash on the face, including the nasolabial folds which had lasted for several years and, on dermatologic evaluation 2 years earlier, was not thought to be typical of systemic lupus erythematosus, and a positive antinuclear antibody test speckled and centromere pattern, 1:160 dilution. She had had two cesarean sections, a total hip replacement, a chole-cystectomy, and a tonsillectomy. Medications included levothyroxine, valsartan, hydrochloro-thiazide, hydroxyzine, calcium, vitamin D, ibuprofen, biotin, and folate. She had no known allergies. She lived with her husband and had adult children. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her mother had died at 69 years of age and had had hypertension and breast cancer, one brother had diabetes mellitus, and another brother had hypertension and hyperlipidemia; there was no family history of gynecologic cancer. On examination, the blood pressure was 137/86 mm Hg, the pulse 93 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, the temperature 36.6C, and the weight 103.2 kg. There was growth of dark brown terminal hair on the upper lip, chin, submental region, and neck and hair loss on the frontal region and vertex of the scalp. A pelvic examination revealed normal female external genitalia, without clitoromegaly, cervical motion tenderness, uterine pain, or adnexal pain, fullness, or masses. The remainder of the examination was normal. The white-cell count, differential count, platelet count, and red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase and results of coagulation and renal-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Dustin Dezube Medicine: A 36-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of a mass in the middle lobe of the right lung. The patient had been in her usual health until 1 month before this admission, when pain in the right shoulder and discomfort in the left lower abdomen developed. The shoulder pain worsened with inspiration and was associated with nonproductive cough, intermittent fevers to a temperature of 38.1C, sinus pain, nasal discharge, periorbital erythema, and difficulty breathing. Eleven days before this admission, she presented to another health center for evaluation. Physical examination reportedly revealed a new cardiac murmur. A chest radiograph showed a mass in the right middle lobe and a right pleural effusion. Six days before this admission, an axial computed tomographic CT scan of the chest that was obtained at another hospital showed a homogeneous opacity 5.8 cm by 4.9 cm extending from the pleura to the hilum, as well as interlobular septal thickening in the right middle lobe, mediastinal and right hilar lymphade-nopathy, and a loculated right pleural effusion. The patient was admitted to that hospital, and thoracentesis was performed. Results of analysis of the serosanguin-eous pleural fluid 120-ml sample are shown in Table 1. Culture of the fluid grew Staphylococcus lugdunensis. The patient was discharged home the next morning, with a prescription for a 5-day course of azithromycin and cefpodoxime. She was referred to the thoracic surgery service at this hospital for further evaluation and bronchoscopy. On presentation 5 days later, bronchoscopic evaluation revealed erythema in the right bronchus intermedius and bronchus of the right middle lobe, with no endo-bronchial lesions or secretions. Microbiologic testing and cytologic examination of bronchoalveolar-lavage BAL fluid from the right middle lobe were nondiagnos-tic. The patient was admitted to this hospital. The patient reported headaches and pain along the diaphragm and right shoulder on deep inspiration. At 17 years of age, she had had hydrocephalus due to a web in the aqueduct of Sylvius that resolved after temporary placement of a right frontal ventriculoperitoneal shunt and performance of an endoscopic third ventriculostomy. Temporal-lobe epilepsy later developed and was caused by a right mesial temporal cavernous malformation that was successfully resected. A second cavernous malformation in the cerebellum had been stable on serial magnetic resonance imaging MRI. The patient was born in Europe and had moved to the United States 8 years earlier. She had visited Switzerland, California, and Michigan during the previous year, and she had visited Cuba 10 years earlier. She was married and worked in a research field, with exposures to yeast and mice 2 years earlier. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She had a family history of rheumatoid arthritis, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and asthma. On examination, the temperature was 37.5C, and the pulse 101 beats per minute; the other vital signs were normal. Decreased breath sounds in the right lung and a soft cardiac murmur were present. The examination was otherwise normal. Dr. Subba R. Digumarthy: An axial CT scan of the chest, obtained without the administration of contrast material, showed a homogeneous opacity 5.8 cm by 4.9 cm extending from the pleura to the hilum, as well as interlobular sep-tal thickening in the right middle lobe, a nodule 3 mm in diameter in the right upper lobe, atelec-tasis in both lower lobes, and a loculated right pleural effusion that was bigger than that seen on the scan obtained 6 days earlier Fig. 1. Dr. Dezube: Blood levels of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were normal, as were results of renal-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 2. Vancomycin, cefepime, and metroni-dazole were administered for 1 day after the bronchoscopy. The next day, a chest tube was inserted into the right pleural space, and 1600 ml of yellow pleural fluid was drained; results of pleural-fluid analysis are shown in Table 1. Cytologic examination of the fluid revealed mesothelial cells, histiocytes, and neutrophils but no malignant cells. On the fourth day, the chest tube was removed. The patient was discharged home the following day, with a prescription for a 3-week course of ceftriaxone. During the next month, follow-up imaging studies of the chest showed increasing nodular thickening of the right major fissure, a left pleural effusion, and a decreasing right pleural effusion; the findings were otherwise stable. Pathological examination of specimens obtained from a percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy and core biopsy of the large mass in the right middle lobe showed mixed inflammation, with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils. Microbiologic staining and cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi were negative. One month after admission to this hospital, symptoms persisted and the patient was readmitted for further evaluation. She reported a dry cough, dyspnea, generalized fatigue, weakness, and pain in her shoulders, neck, and lower back. Medications included narcotic analgesic agents, ranitidine, calcium carbonate, and acetaminophen. On examination, the vital signs were normal, and the oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The breath sounds were decreased bilaterally; the decrease was greater on the left side than on the right. Pulmonary-function testing revealed a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 1.18 liters (37% of the predicted value), a forced vital capacity of 1.40 liters (36% of the predicted value), a peak expiratory flow rate of 4.25 liters per minute (65% of the predicted value), and a carbon monoxide diffusing capacity corrected for alveolar volume of 3.47 ml per minute per millimeter of mercury per liter (62% of the predicted value). Results of coagulation tests and blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and aspartate and alanine aminotransferases were normal; other test results are shown in Table 2. Urinalysis was normal. Chest radiographs showed a mass in the right middle lobe, a patchy left basilar opacity that was consistent with atelectasis, a stable right pleural effusion, and a moderate left pleural effusion. A pigtail catheter was inserted into the left pleural space. Cytologic examination of serosanguineous pleural fluid (75-ml sample) revealed mesothelial cells, histiocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils; other test results are shown in Table 1. The next day, thoracoscopy, lobectomies of the right middle and lower lobes, total pulmonary decortication, and dissection of mediastinal lymph nodes were all performed with the use of video-assisted techniques. Pathological examination revealed evidence of extensive lipoid pneumonia (i.e., the accumulation of lipids in the alveoli) and fibrinous pleuritis. The patient had no complications associated with the procedures and was discharged home 5 days later. During the next 5 months, the patient had persistent dyspnea on exertion and pain in the inferior portion of the chest that was thought to be musculoskeletal. Chest radiographs showed postoperative changes and pleural effusions, without infiltrates. Six months after the first admission to this hospital, examination revealed crackles, for which an antibiotic agent was administered; the symptoms improved. Three weeks later, cardiopulmonary testing with the use of a modified Bruce protocol, performed at rest and after 12 minutes of exercise, revealed pulses of 96 and 151 beats per minute and oxygen saturations of 99% and 88% (while the patient was breathing ambient air), respectively. Two weeks later, at an outpatient visit, the patient reported night sweats, persistent cough, fatigue, and sinus congestion. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 2. Dr. Digumarthy: A chest CT that was obtained during that visit showed new bilateral, subpleural ground-glass and reticular opacities. Subpleural nodular consolidation in the left lower lobe and consolidation in the medial right lung around the bronchial stump were present (Figure 2).Dr. Dezube: Bronchoscopy was performed, and cytologic examination and microbiologic testing of the BAL fluid were nondiagnostic. Flow cytometry revealed 34% granulocytes, a finding consistent with inflammation. Chest pain, which the patient rated at 5 out of 10 at rest and 8 out of 10 with deep inspiration and coughing (on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain), persisted despite administration of amoxicillin–clavulanate, glucocorticoid therapy, and a narcotic analgesic agent. One week later, pain in the right hip developed, without a known injury. The following week, examination revealed pain on active flexion of the right hip. Test results are shown in Table 2. Dr. Digumarthy: MRI of the hip, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed a right superior labral tear with a surrounding inflammatory change (2.0 cm by 1.7 cm) along the proximal right iliopsoas muscle and a left adnexal cyst (4.0 cm by 2.5 cm); there was no evidence of fracture or osteonecrosis. MRI of the pelvis was performed; T2-weighted images showed an abnormal signal that extended along the right iliac vessels and involved the adjacent medial right psoas and iliacus muscles, with no fluid collection. A hemorrhagic left ovarian cyst and a right paracentral disk protrusion at L4–L5 that had contact with the descending right L4 nerve roots were also noted. Dr. Dezube: A diagnosis was made. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "IgG4-related lung disease. ", "prediction": "1. Infectious pneumonia (likely bacterial): The presence of fever, cough, and pleural effusion with a positive culture for Staphylococcus lugdunensis strongly supports an infectious etiology.\n2. Tuberculosis: Given the chronic nature of her symptoms, pleural effusion, and negative initial cultures, tuberculosis remains a possibility despite the lack of direct microbiological confirmation.\n3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient’s dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and presence of pleural effusions could be indicative of a pulmonary embolism, despite the absence of imaging confirmation.\n4. Lung cancer: The presence of a mass in the right middle lobe, associated lymphadenopathy, and persistent symptoms despite treatment raises concern for a malignancy.\n5. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: The patient's occupational exposure to yeast and mice and the presence of ground-glass opacities on chest CT suggest an exposure-related inflammatory lung disease.\n6. Autoimmune disease-related pleuritis/vasculitis: Her family history of rheumatoid arthritis and the systemic nature of her symptoms may point to an autoimmune process such as lupus or rheumatoid pleuritis.\n7. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s): This condition could explain the sinus pain, nasal discharge, and pulmonary findings with systemic involvement.\n8. Pulmonary sarcoidosis: Given the lymphadenopathy, inflammatory cell infiltrate seen on biopsy, and chronic nature of her symptoms, sarcoidosis should be considered.\n9. Fungal infection: The patient’s travel history and immunocompromised state from her epilepsy medication could predispose her to a fungal infection despite initial negative cultures.\n10.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Nwamaka Eneanya: A 72-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of a new kidney mass. Approximately 1.5 years before the current evaluation, while the patient was in the Dominican Republic, she sought medical attention for episodic pain of the right flank, with no other symptoms. At that time, she was told she had microscopic hematuria that may be due to kidney stones, and she received a prescription for unknown oral medications. After she took the medications, the flank pain resolved, and she had no further follow-up. Two weeks before the current evaluation, bilateral back and flank pain developed. She was evaluated at a local health center. An abdominal ultrasound examination revealed a partially exophytic mass 2.8 cm by 2.6 cm by 2.5 cm in the lower pole of the right kidney, with mixed echogenicity and internal vascularity. No hydronephrosis or renal stones were visualized, and the sizes of the kidneys were normal. The patient was referred for a consultation with a nephrologist at this hospital. On evaluation in the nephrology clinic of this hospital, the patient reported mild headache, nausea, and constipation; there was no abdominal or pelvic pain, hematuria, foamy urine, weight loss, anorexia, peripheral or facial edema, or rash. She had a history of stage 4 chronic kidney disease with a baseline creatinine level of 1.8 mg per deciliter 159.1 mol per liter, diabetes mellitus type 2, systemic hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, tinnitus, and bilateral sensori-neural hearing loss and had undergone an appendectomy and a hysterectomy. Medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, atenolol, chlorthalidone, sitagliptin, and iron sulfate. The patient was from the Dominican Republic and had immigrated to the United States 1 year earlier. She had four children and was retired. She smoked two to five cigarettes daily and had done so for the past 30 years. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She had no family history of kidney stones, renal disease, or cancer. On examination, the patient appeared to be comfortable. The temperature was 36.5C, the pulse 60 beats per minute, the blood pressure 154/71 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98 while she was breathing ambient air. There were well-healed incisions in the right lower quadrant and along the midline of the abdomen. The abdomen was soft and non-tender, without palpable masses. No flank or costovertebral-angle tenderness, inguinal lymph-adenopathy, or peripheral edema was present. The remainder of the examination was normal. A complete blood count and iron studies including levels of iron, iron-binding capacity, and ferritin were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, and albumin; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.008, a pH of 7.0, 1 occult blood, 3 albumin, 5 to 10 red cells and 0 to 2 white cells per high-power field, and no glucose, bilirubin, ketones, or nitrite. A test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a dilution of 1:160. Tests for antibodies to double-stranded DNA, hepatitis C antibodies, hepatitis B core IgM antibodies, and Bence Jones protein were negative. Levels of C3, C4, and immunoglobulins were normal, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis. Lisinopril was prescribed. Dr. Aoife Kilcoyne: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the kidneys was performed without the intravenous administration of gadolinium because of impaired renal function. The images showed a complex, solid mass measuring 3.0 cm by 2.9 cm by 2.9 cm in the lower pole of the right kidney. On T1-weighted and T2-weighted images Fig. 1A and 1B, the lesion had heterogeneous signal intensity. On T1-weighted gradient-echo in-phase and out-of-phase images Fig. 1C and 1D, there was loss of signal at the posterior aspect of the lesion, a finding consistent with the presence of intravoxel fat. The mass was suspicious for renal carcinoma. Dr. Eneanya: Diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Renal-cell carcinoma. Membranous glomerular disease and possible early diabetic glomerulosclerosis. ", "prediction": "1. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC): The complex mass in the lower pole of the right kidney with heterogeneous signal intensity and intravoxel fat suggests malignancy such as RCC.\n2. Angiomyolipoma: The presence of intravoxel fat within the renal mass raises suspicion for angiomyolipoma, although it's less likely given the internal vascularity noted on ultrasound.\n3. Oncocytoma: A benign renal tumor that can present with mixed echogenicity on imaging but typically does not have intravoxel fat.\n4. Metastatic disease: Given her history of smoking and the characteristics of the renal mass, metastatic disease, though unlikely without other primary sites, must be considered.\n5.

One year before this presentation, a ballooning lesion had developed in the patients left ear canal that partially occluded the lumen and was associated with pruritus and recurrent bleeding. An unknown medication was administered topically into the ear canal, with improvement in both bleeding and pruritus. Two weeks before this presentation, bleeding from the left ear canal recurred, with associated pruritus of both ear canals. The patient was seen by a physician at another clinic, who prescribed an otic suspension consisting of neomycin, polymyxin B sulfate, and hydrocortisone and a 5-day course of oral azithromycin, as well as topical clobetasol propionate ointment 0.05 for pruritus; the symptoms did not improve, and the bleeding did not resolve. She was referred to the outpatient otolaryngology clinic of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. The patient reported brief episodes of sharp, stabbing otalgia on the left side, with episodes of disequilibrium that lasted for a few seconds and were not associated with vertigo, tinnitus, or changes in hearing. She had not had recurrent otitis media during childhood, exposure to loud noises, or head trauma with loss of consciousness. She took no other medications and had no known allergies. She worked in a health-related field. She did not smoke or drink alcohol. On examination, the patient appeared to be well, with no craniofacial dysmor-phism. A light pink raised lesion approximately 1.0 cm by 1.0 cm by 0.5 cm, with a cobblestone appearance and several prominent vessels, was present on the posterior tragus of the left ear; on examination with an operating microscope, the lesion extended medially along the anterior wall of the external auditory canal. The eardrums, medial left ear canal, and entire right ear canal were normal. There was no tragal tenderness. A 512-Hz tuning fork was used to show that the Rinne test was positive bilaterally with air conduction greater than bone conduction and that, on the Weber test, the sound was located along the midline. The remainder of the examination of the nose, nasopharynx, mouth, pharynx, larynx, neck, ears for hearing acuity for conversational speech, and third through twelfth cranial nerves was normal, and there was no spontaneous nystagmus. A culture of the left external ear canal grew a moderate amount of coagulase-negative staphylococcus species. Topical nystatintriamcinolone ointment was administered to the left ear twice daily for 2 weeks, without improvement. One week later, the patient returned to the outpatient clinic. She reported near constant pruritus and bleeding that had increased in amount and frequency. The lesion in the left ear canal appeared to be unchanged from the previous examination. A small crust covered the most medial aspect of the lesion. Nine days later, a diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Epithelioid hemangioma. ", "prediction": "1. Ear Canal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: The persistent lesion with recurrent bleeding, despite multiple treatments, raises suspicion for malignancy.\n2. Chronic Otitis Externa: The constant pruritus and positive culture for coagulase-negative staphylococcus suggest a chronic inflammatory process.\n3. Seborrheic Dermatitis: The cobblestone appearance and pruritus may indicate a recurrent dermatological condition affecting the ear canal.\n4. Ear Canal Cholesteatoma: The ballooning lesion partially occluding the ear canal could be indicative of a cholesteatoma.\n5. Granulomatous Otitis Externa: The raised lesion and its chronic nature may suggest a granulomatous inflammatory response.\n6. Ear Canal Hemangioma: The presence of prominent vessels within the lesion could point to a vascular tumor like a hemangioma.\n7. Fungal Otitis Externa: The persistent symptoms and treatment resistance could be due to an underlying fungal infection not fully addressed by the treatments.\n8. Ear Canal Psoriasis: The pruritic nature of the lesion and cobblestone appearance might be a manifestation of psoriasis.\n9. Contact Dermatitis: The patient's occupation in a health-related field might expose her to allergens or irritants causing contact dermatitis.\n10. Vasculitis: The recurrent bleeding and presence of prominent vessels might be due to a vasculitic process affecting the ear canal."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Christopher J. Danford Medicine: A 76-year-old man with multiple medical problems was admitted to this hospital because of persistent fever, leukopenia, and pulmonary infiltrates. The patient had been generally well until approximately 5 weeks before this admission, when fever to a temperature of 38.9C, chills, cough, night sweats, diarrhea, fatigue, weakness, and anorexia occurred. Four weeks before this admission, he was seen by his physician, who noted that he had had a weight loss of 5 kg in the previous 7 months. Urinalysis and cultures of urine and blood were reportedly negative. A chest radiograph and computed tomographic CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained without the administration of contrast material, were reportedly negative and were not available for review. The diarrhea resolved, but other symptoms persisted. Three weeks before this admission, CT of the chest reportedly revealed diffuse symmetric fine interstitial reticular lung nodularities, small pleural effusions, and mild splenomegaly. Two days later, the patient fell because of profound weakness and was admitted to another hospital. He had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease with previous bypass grafting, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease with previous aortofemoral bypass surgery, noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, gout, and benign pros-tatic hypertrophy. He also had transitional-cell carcinoma of the bladder that was in remission after treatment including bacille CalmetteGuerin BCG therapy, which had most recently been administered 7 months earlier. Medications taken at home were sitagliptin, metformin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, atenolol, clopidogrel, finasteride, dutasteride, terazosin, allopurinol, citalopram, folate, a multivitamin, and ipratropiumalbuterol by inhalation. On examination, the temperature was 39.9C, the blood pressure 110/82 mm Hg, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93 while the patient was breathing ambient air and 97 while he was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. There was abdominal distention, with tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Results of coagulation tests and blood levels of total and direct bilirubin were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a horseshoe kidney and a mildly heterogeneous liver. A chest radiograph showed a patchy opacity in the right midzone Fig. 1A. Transthoracic echocardiography reportedly revealed no evidence of endocarditis. During the first week, testing was negative for influenza antigen, as well as for human immunodeficiency virus HIV, EpsteinBarr virus, cytomegalovirus, Borrelia burgdorferi, ehrlichia, Anaplasma phagocyto-philum, babesia, rickettsia Rocky Mountain spotted fever, parvovirus, and hepatitis A, B, and C viruses. Cultures of the blood and urine were negative. Pathological examination of a bone marrowbiopsy specimen and aspirate, which was performed because of the pancytopenia, was normal. Diffuse bilateral interstitial pulmonary edema developed; fluid was restricted, and furosemide administered. Dr. Shaunagh McDermott: On the fifth day, a chest radiograph showed a persistent patchy opacity in the right midzone and diffuse reticular opacities in the lung bases Fig. 1B. The next day, a CT scan of the chest showed diffuse ground-glass opacities throughout both lungs; the ground-glass opacities in the dependent lower lobes were more confluent. There were also small bilateral pleural effusions. Dr. Danford: Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. On the 9th day, hemoptysis occurred, the temperature rose to 39.1C, and the oxygen saturation decreased to 89 while the patient was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 1 liter per minute. The rate of oxygen supplementation was increased to 3 liters per minute. Bronchoalveolar lavage reportedly revealed no evidence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage or malignant cells; cultures of the lavage fluid were negative. After consultation with a rheumatolo-gist, methylprednisolone 1 g daily was administered for 3 days, followed by prednisone 60 mg daily. The fevers initially improved but then recurred. On the 15th day, video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed. Pathological examination of a lung-biopsy specimen reportedly revealed extensive noncaseating granulomatous inflammation and granulomas in both bronchi-olocentric and lymphangitic distributions. On the 18th day, hemoptysis recurred, and the oxygen saturation decreased to 86 while the patient was at rest and breathing ambient air. Dr. McDermott: A second CT scan of the chest Fig. 2 revealed persistent diffuse ground-glass opacities with subpleural reticulations in the lower lobes bilaterally; these findings were now visible because of the decrease in size of the bilateral pleural effusions. There was evidence of wedge resections of the right upper and lower lobes and subcutaneous emphysema. Dr. Danford: Vancomycin and piperacillin tazobactam were administered. The day before this admission, confusion developed, with associated myoclonus during sleep and a temperature of 38.9C. Lumbar puncture and CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head were performed; the studies revealed atrophy but no evidence of acute infarction, hemorrhage, or space-occupying masses. The dose of glucocorti-coid therapy was decreased. On the 22nd day, a chest radiograph showed a persistent opacity in the right midzone and subcutaneous emphysema. Ethambutol, rifampin, and isoniazid were administered. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was transferred and admitted to this hospital. The patient was allergic to contrast dye. He lived alone and had retired from the construction industry, with past exposure to asbestos. He had a 46-pack-year history of smoking and had stopped 10 years earlier; he had stopped drinking alcohol 20 years earlier and did not use illicit drugs. He had traveled to Mexico in the remote past. His son, who lived nearby, owned chickens. He was a hunter and had had exposures to deer, rabbits, and pheasants in the previous 5 months. His father and brother may have had rheumatoid arthritis. On examination, the patient appeared to be mildly uncomfortable and was flushed. The respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93 while he was breathing ambient air; the other vital signs were normal. He had shallow ulcerations on the right side of the hard palate, crackles in both lung bases, occasional expiratory wheezes, and trace ankle edema on the left side. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of coagulation tests and blood levels of phosphorus and total and direct bilirubin were normal; testing for antibodies to the Goodpasture antigen was negative, as were the results of a lung panel for hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Antibiotic agents and glu-cocorticoids were not administered. On the third day, a diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Disseminated Mycobacterium bovis infection. M. bovis, I asked the referring hospital to provide unstained recut sections of lung tissue in an attempt to visualize the mycobacterium. We attempted this on six slides, and no mycobacteria ", "prediction": "1. Sarcoidosis: The presence of noncaseating granulomas in the lung biopsies and the patient's interstitial lung disease are highly indicative of sarcoidosis.\n2. Chronic Beryllium Disease: Considering the patient's past occupational exposure to construction materials and the similarities in radiological findings to sarcoidosis, this condition should be considered.\n3. Tuberculosis: Despite negative cultures, the patient's symptoms and granulomatous inflammation could suggest a dormant or unusual presentation of tuberculosis.\n4. Histoplasmosis: Given the patient's history of exposure to chicken coops, histoplasmosis is a plausible cause of granulomatous lung disease and systemic symptoms.\n5. Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis): The presence of chronic inflammation, granulomas, and hemoptysis could be consistent with this autoimmune vasculitis.\n6. Disseminated Mycobacterial Infection: Exposure to BCG therapy and decreased immune function due to chronic diseases could facilitate such an infection, despite negative cultures.\n7. Lymphoma: The systemic symptoms, splenomegaly, and weight loss could be indicative of an underlying lymphoma with granulomatous involvement of the lungs.\n8. Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia: The persistent ground-glass opacities and organizing pneumonia pattern on CT scans suggest this is a differential consideration.\n9. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Exacerbation with Secondary Infection: Given the history of COPD and current pulmonary symptoms, this remains a differential with secondary infection potentially complicating the picture.\n10. Medication-Induced Lung Disease: Some medications such as metformin and statins have been associated with interstitial lung disease, potentially explaining the patient's symptoms after excluding other causes."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Gregory L. Hundemer Medicine: A 21-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of fatigue, weight loss, and lesions in the lungs and liver on radiographic imaging. The patient had been in excellent health, running 3 to 5 miles daily and competing in sports, until approximately 3 months before this admission, when increasing fatigue occurred. During the next 6 weeks, his sleep requirement increased from 8 to 20 hours per day. Approximately 2 months before this admission, he was a passenger in a motor vehicle accident, after which he had an exacerbation of chronic back pain that he had previously attributed to sports activities. He was seen in a clinic of another hospital a few days later; a radiograph of the cervical spine was normal. He took nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs as needed for pain. One week later, he went to the emergency department of a second hospital because of fatigue, low back pain, and bilateral swelling of the breast tissue. Testing for Lyme disease was negative. He was advised to discontinue taking the workout supplements which contained creatine nitrate that he had been taking for several years. The next week, he returned to the second hospital because of worsening symptoms; test results were reportedly unchanged. A muscle relaxant was administered, without improvement. One month before this admission, anorexia, nausea, nonbilious nonbloody vomiting, weight loss, intermittent chills, and anxiety occurred, followed by dys-pnea with exertion and decreased exercise tolerance i.e., exercise was limited to walking several blocks before resting. On evaluation in the emergency department of the second hospital 3 weeks before this admission, testing for Lyme disease was negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. The stool was positive for occult blood, and urinalysis revealed trace protein, increased urobilinogen 2.0; reference range, 0.0 to 1.0, and 9 red cells per high-power field reference range, 0 to 5. Diagnoses of anemia and hyperthyroidism were made. The patient was discharged with instructions to see a gastroenterologist and an endocrinologist. The next day, on evaluation in a gastroenterology clinic, the patient reported fatigue, weight loss of 6 kg from 82 kg to 76 kg, and hematochezia. The body-mass index BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 21.6. There was abdominal guarding and tenderness in the right lower quadrant, with no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. The stool was brown, with occult blood. Four days later, upper and lower endoscopic examinations revealed no active bleeding. Pathological examination of bowel-biopsy specimens was reportedly normal. Ten days later 6 days before this admission, the patient was evaluated by an endocrinologist. Thyroid scintigraphy reportedly showed elevated and diffuse uptake of radioactive iodine. Therapy with methimazole and propranolol was begun. Two days before this admission, on return to the gastroenterology clinic, the patient reported persistent symptoms, as well as cough, sweats, nocturia, dark urine, and intermittent tremors. The temperature was normal, the blood pressure 118/50 mm Hg, the pulse 100 beats per minute, and the BMI 20.0. Wasting of the facial muscle was noted. The stool was positive for occult blood. Therapy with ondansetron was begun. The next day, the blood level of vitamin B12 was normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed at the second hospital with the administration of oral contrast material, revealed numerous pulmonary masses up to 4 cm in diameter at the lung bases, hepatomegaly with lesions in the liver up to 13 cm by 9 cm, massive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and gyne-comastia. Because of these findings and at the request of his family, the patient was referred to this hospital. On presentation, the patient reported fatigue and anxiety, both of which had improved after treatment with methimazole and propranolol. He also reported persistent nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort which he rated at 3 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe discomfort, dyspnea, and weight loss of 14 kg in the previous 2.5 weeks. Four years earlier, he had had methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus preseptal cellulitis after trauma above his right eye. Medications were methimazole, propranolol, and ondansetron. He had no known allergies. He lived with his family, attended college, and had jobs during vacation. He had chewed tobacco and drunk alcohol but had stopped doing both 1 month before this admission; he reported no use of intravenous illicit drugs. His mother had Graves disease, his father had hypothyroidism and hypertension, his maternal grandmother had diabetes mellitus, and his siblings were healthy. On examination, the patient appeared to be fatigued. The vital signs were normal, and the oxygen saturation was 100 while he was breathing ambient air. There was tender gynecomastia and inguinal lymphadenopathy on the right side; the right testicle was larger than the left, without tenderness or fluctuance. Hepatomegaly to the umbilicus was present. The remainder of the examination was normal, with no splenomegaly or palpable lymphadenopathy. The activated partial-thromboplastin time and plasma lactic acid level were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, alanine aminotransferase, amylase, and lipase and results of renal-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Micheal McInnis: A chest radiograph showed bilateral, well-circumscribed pulmonary nodules and masses. Contrast-enhanced CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed bilateral pulmonary nodules and masses, with the greatest distribution in the lower lung zones Fig. 1A. No notable mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopa-thy was present. Bilateral, symmetric gynecomas-tia was observed Fig. 1B. Multiple heterogeneous masses, measuring up to 11 cm in longest transverse dimension, were distributed throughout the liver Fig. 1C. A necrotic retroperitoneal nodal mass was observed in the interaortocaval position, below the level of the renal hila Fig. 1D. The third and fourth segments of the duodenum were compressed and displaced anteriorly by the retroperitoneal nodal mass. No other notable retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy was present. The remaining organs of the abdomen and pelvis were unremarkable. Ultrasonography of the scrotum revealed an area of calcification 3 mm by 4 mm by 2 mm in the right lower testicle; the right testis was 4.0 cm by 2.8 cm by 2.1 cm, and the left testis was 3.7 cm by 2.6 cm by 2.0 cm. Dr. Hundemer: The patient was admitted to this hospital, and diagnostic procedures were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Metastatic choriocarcinoma. ", "prediction": "1. Metastatic testicular cancer: The presence of multiple pulmonary and hepatic lesions, gynecomastia, and an enlarged right testicle strongly suggests a primary testicular tumor with metastatic spread.\n2. Lymphoma: The widespread lymphadenopathy, including retroperitoneal nodal masses, hepatomegaly, and pulmonary nodules could indicate a lymphoma such as Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n3. Hyperthyroidism: The earlier thyroid scintigraphy showing elevated uptake and therapy with methimazole and propranolol could explain symptoms like fatigue, weight loss, and gynecomastia, although it does not account for the lung and liver lesions.\n4. Metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma: The hepatic lesions and hepatomegaly combined with systemic symptoms can suggest primary liver cancer with metastases, though this is less likely given the patient's age and lack of predisposing factors.\n5. Chronic infectious disease: Conditions such as tuberculosis or fungal infections could present with pulmonary nodules, weight loss, and generalized symptoms, although the pattern and combination of other findings make this less likely.\n6. Sarcoidosis: This could present with pulmonary and liver lesions; however, the presence of gynecomastia and the marked systemic symptoms reduce its likelihood.\n7. Autoimmune disease: Conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus or vasculitis can cause multi-organ involvement, including lung and liver lesions, but it is less likely without supporting laboratory evidence.\n8. Primary lung carcinoma with metastases: Given the age and health history of the patient, this is less likely, but primary lung cancer can metastasize to the liver and cause systemic symptoms.\n9. Non-infectious granulomatous diseases: Diseases like Wegener's granulomatosis could present with pulmonary and systemic findings, although the absence of specific diagnostic features makes this less likely.\n10. Metabolic or genetic disorders: Conditions like hemochromatosis or Wilson's disease, while rare, could present with hepatomegaly and systemic symptoms, though pulmonary involvement is atypical."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Peggy S. Lai: A 22-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit of this hospital in the winter because of hypoxemia and shock. The patient had been well until 5 days before admission, when head congestion, subjective fever, chills, and a nonproductive wet cough developed. He self-administered ibuprofen and acetaminophen, without improvement. One day before admission, he was seen in the emergency department of another hospital. On examination, the temperature was 37.3C, the blood pressure 119/69 mm Hg, the pulse 97 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while he was breathing ambient air. Rales and wheezing were heard in the lungs, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: A posteroanterior chest radiograph was clear Fig. 1A. Dr. Lai: A diagnosis of bronchitis was made. Albuterol and ipratropium were administered by nebulizer, and a 4-day course of prednisone was begun. The patients symptoms reportedly improved, and he was discharged home with instructions to continue the prednisone course, begin therapy with an albuterol inhaler, and follow up with his physician. Approximately 24 hours later, relatives took the patient back to the emergency department of the other hospital because of cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea, diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting; he reported no chest pain. On examination, he was in severe respiratory distress. The temperature was 36.8C, the blood pressure 51/33 mm Hg, the pulse 165 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 55 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 79 while he was breathing ambient air. His skin was ashen and mottled, and he had diffuse rales in both lungs; the abdomen was soft, and there were no cardiac murmurs or edema. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A rapid influenza diagnostic test of a nasal swab was reportedly negative. Blood cultures were obtained. High-flow oxygen through a nonrebreather face mask and normal saline were administered. The oxygen saturation rose to 89 within minutes. Dr. Shepard: A chest radiograph showed diffuse bilateral consolidations with some nodular opacification that were more prominent in the right lung than in the left lung; some had nodular contours. The size of the heart was normal, and no pleural fluid or pneumothorax was seen Fig. 1B. Dr. Lai: An electrocardiogram revealed a ventricular rate of 161 beats per minute and was otherwise normal. A continuous infusion of nor-epinephrine was begun. Thirty minutes after the patients arrival at the other hospital, respiratory distress persisted, with labored breathing, nasal flaring, retractions, and diminished breath sounds throughout. Treatment with bilevel positive airway pressure was initiated, and the oxygen saturation rose to 100; the respiratory rate was 12 breaths per minute, the blood pressure 102/85 mm Hg, the pulse 159 beats per minute, and the rectal temperature 40.7C. Oseltamivir, piperacillin tazobactam, levofloxacin, vancomycin, clindamy-cin, methylprednisolone, and ketorolac were administered. Three hours 10 minutes after the patients arrival, the oxygen saturation was 88 while he was receiving treatment with bilevel positive airway pressure. He was sedated, the trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure PEEP was begun. A triple-lumen central venous catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein. The patient was transported by medical helicopter to this hospital, arriving approximately 6 hours after his presentation at the other hospital. Additional history was obtained from family members. The patient had been well and was taking no medications until this illness developed. He had recently started spray painting buildings for work. He had no history of travel. He had visited the home of his adoptive parents the previous week; one relative had felt ill but the condition had since improved. On examination, the patient was unresponsive and cold to the touch. He had poor capillary refill while he was receiving ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen at a rate of 30 breaths per minute, with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 1.0, a PEEP of 20 cm of water, and a tidal volume of 7 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. He had intermittent agonal spontaneous breaths over the ventilated breaths, and the oxygen saturation was 82 while he was receiving ventila-tory support. The temperature was 36.1C, and the femoral pulses were 125 beats per minute; when measurements of systemic blood pressure were attempted, no reading could be obtained. The height was 180 cm, the weight 76.2 kg, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 23.5. The lips were blue. The breath sounds were diminished bilaterally, with diffuse rhonchi and poor air movement. The heart sounds were distant and tachycardic, without murmurs. The skin was cool and poorly perfused; there was no peripheral edema, and the abdomen was soft. Bloody respiratory secretions were suctioned. Blood levels of total and direct bilirubin, amylase, lactase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed amber cloudy urine, with a specific gravity of 1.013, 2 occult blood, 1 glucose, and 2 albumin; the urine sediment showed 3 to 5 red cells and 5 to 10 white cells per high-power field, 10 to 20 hyaline casts and 5 to 10 granular casts per low-power field, squamous cells, and mucin. Toxicologic screening of the urine revealed cannabinoids; screening of the blood and urine for other toxins was negative. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia. The rate of infusion of norepinephrine was increased, and dobutamine and vasopressin were added. Sodium bicarbonate, fentanyl, versed, propofol, vecuronium bromide, vancomycin, cefepime, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, levo-floxacin, and phytonadione were administered. Platelets were transfused. An indwelling catheter was placed transcutaneously into the femoral artery. Transthoracic ultrasonography, which was performed at the bedside, revealed diffuse decreased cardiac function, a decreased ejection fraction, and no evidence of right ventricular enlargement or pericardial effusion; hypotension persisted. Four hours after the patients arrival at this hospital, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO was begun at the bedside. Dr. Shepard: A portable chest radiograph that was obtained shortly after the patient was admitted to this hospital showed slight, gradual progression in consolidations bilaterally and showed the placement of an endotracheal tube, a central venous catheter, and a nasogastric tube Fig. 2A. On a radiograph that was obtained 4 hours later, an ECMO catheter was present in the superior vena cava and other findings were unchanged Fig. 2B.

Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP): The rapid progression of respiratory distress, bilateral lung consolidations, and fever suggests a severe bacterial or viral pneumonia.\n2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxemia, bilateral lung infiltrates on radiographs, and lack of cardiogenic signs point towards ARDS, possibly secondary to an infectious or inflammatory cause.\n3. Septic Shock: Persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, lactic acidosis, and signs of multi-organ dysfunction are indicative of septic shock, potentially secondary to a severe infection.\n4. Influenza: Despite a negative rapid test, the clinical presentation of a febrile respiratory illness with a rapid decline could still be consistent with influenza requiring antiviral therapy.\n5. Toxic Inhalation Injury: His recent occupational exposure to spray paint may suggest the possibility of inhalation of toxic chemicals leading to acute lung injury and respiratory failure.\n6. Viral Myocarditis: The echocardiographic findings of decreased cardiac function and troponin elevation raise the possibility of viral myocarditis, which could explain the cardiogenic shock.\n7. Severe Bronchitis with Complications: While initially diagnosed with bronchitis, the rapid clinical deterioration and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates may indicate a progression to a more severe respiratory illness.\n8. Tuberculosis: Although less common, the chronic cough, weight loss, and bilateral lung infiltrates could be signs of an acute presentation of tuberculosis, especially if there is a history of exposure.\n9. Pulmonary Embolism: The hypoxemia, cough, and reduced cardiac function could suggest a massive pulmonary embolism, particularly in the context of rapid clinical decline and shock.\n10. Hemorrhagic Viral Fever: Although less likely given the negative travel history, the presence of bloody respiratory secretions coupled with rapid deterioration could suggest an atypical presentation of a hemorrhagic viral infection."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Alex S. Keuroghlian Psychiatry: A 40-year-old woman with a history of psychosis was admitted to this hospital from a homeless shelter because of headache and hypertension. One week before admission, the patient had accepted placement in a homeless shelter, after spending the previous 4 years sleeping in a public building. During that time, she had repeatedly declined assistance from outreach workers in finding shelter; she maintained that it was her mission from God to stay outside and watch over people. On evaluation at the shelter, she was disheveled and had disorganized speech and thought content that was focused on spiritual themes. She attributed her impairments to a traumatic brain injury that she had incurred in a motor vehicle accident more than 12 years earlier. She did not think she had a psychiatric illness and refused psychiatric medications but agreed to see an on-site primary care internist at the shelter. A limited physical examination revealed extensive tinea pedis and venous stasis dermatitis of the legs. On the morning of admission, the patient reported a severe headache that had begun the night before. She permitted a nurse to measure her vital signs; the blood pressure was 1801/10 mm Hg. Emergency medical services were called; on evaluation, the systolic blood pressure measured 212 mm Hg. She was brought by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient reported feeling off and intermittently said she had a frontal headache; she did not report visual symptoms, chest or abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. She had a history of hypertension and a psychotic illness of more than 12 years duration that was characterized by somatic, paranoid, grandiose delusions, a disorganized thought process, and poor self-care. Five years before this admission, she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital; as an inpatient, she had brief symptomatic improvement while she was receiving olanzapine. After discharge, she did not pursue follow-up psychiatric care or continue to take olanzap-ine. She had taken hydrochlorothiazide 4 years before this admission but cur-rently took no medications; she reported an allergy to nifedipine, which had caused palpitations. She was born in a Caribbean country and had immigrated to the northeastern United States many years earlier. She smoked intermittently and did not use illicit drugs but reported being injected in the thigh with an unknown substance in the past. The family history was unknown. On examination, the patient was obese, malodorous, disheveled, and wearing multiple layers of clothing. The blood pressure was 2081/18 mm Hg; a repeat measurement was 2401/30 mm Hg. The pulse was 95 beats per minute, the temperature 36.4C, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while she was breathing ambient air. She had a systolic ejection murmur grade 16 at the right upper sternal border, without rub or gallop. Both legs had 2 pitting edema to the knees, with changes related to chronic stasis and thickening of the skin. The patients attitude was pleasant and cooperative; eye contact was good, with no abnormal movements. Her speech had a low volume and a fast rate. She described her mood as fine, and she appeared to be euthy-mic, with a blunted affect. Her thought process was disorganized, and the content included hy-perreligious and grandiose delusions. She reported auditory hallucinations involving the voices of God and Satan, as well as visions that she believed were messages from God. She reported no suicidal or homicidal ideation; her insight and judgment were poor. The remainder of the general examination was normal. The white-cell and differential counts, results of renal-function and coagulation tests, and urinalysis were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, troponin T, N-terminal proB-type na-triuretic peptide, vitamin B12, and folate. Tests for troponin I and urinary human chorionic gonadotropin were negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram, a chest radiograph, and a computed tomographic CT scan of the head obtained without the administration of contrast material were all normal. Intravenous labetalol and oral captopril were administered; the blood pressure decreased to 1871/11 mm Hg. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Additional doses of labetalol and captopril were administered, as were acetaminophen, dalteparin, ferrous sulfate, omeprazole, folic acid, thiamine, and a multivitamin. The blood pressure decreased to 141/65 mm Hg in the left arm and 141/62 mm Hg in the right arm, and the headache gradually resolved. Screening of the urine for toxins was negative. The patient declined an influenza vaccination. She was discharged to the shelter on the third hospital day, with a plan to receive blood-pressure monitoring on site. Medications on discharge were lisino-pril, thiamine, a multivitamin, folate, omepra-zole, and ferrous sulfate. The patient was advised to follow up in the medical walk-in clinic in 1 week. Management decisions were made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Schizophrenia, cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia, hypertension, and homelessness.

Schizoaffective Disorder: Psychotic symptoms combined with mood disturbances point to this possibility.\n3. Delusional Disorder: The presence of fixed, non-bizarre delusions involving spiritual themes.\n4. Psychosis Induced by a General Medical Condition: Her psychotic symptoms could be triggered by an underlying medical condition such as a traumatic brain injury.\n5. Hyperthyroidism: Although less likely, it can cause both psychosis and hypertension, though her thyroid status isn't detailed in the report.\n6. Cushing's Syndrome: This could explain her hypertension and possible psychotic symptoms.\n7. Severe Anxiety Disorder: Anxiety can present with somatic symptoms including elevated blood pressure.\n8. Pheochromocytoma: This rare adrenal tumor could cause severe hypertension and episodic headaches.\n9. Hypertensive Encephalopathy: The severe headache and very high blood pressure could also point to this diagnosis.\n10. Substance-Induced Psychosis: Although she denies recent use, the history of being injected with an unknown substance may be relevant."}

Lax Pediatric Allergy and Immunology: A boy who was 14 years 8 months of age and had multiple chronic illnesses was seen in the gastroenterol-ogy clinic of this hospital because he had had abnormal results on liver-function tests for approximately 1.5 years. The patient was born by vaginal delivery after a full-term uncomplicated gestation. He was noted to have an undescended testis. He received diagnoses of gastro-esophageal reflux disease and failure to thrive at infancy, followed by type 1 diabetes mellitus at 2 years of age, primary hypothyroidism at 4 years of age, mild speech delay, learning disabilities, recurrent infections including sinusitis, streptococcal pharyngitis, and pneumonias, nocturia, and leukoplakia of the tongue. At 2 years of age, he underwent genetic evaluation at another hospital, and the chromosomes were reportedly normal. Dr. Steven M. Sharatz: When the patient was 10 years of age, magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head Fig. 1A was performed because of chronic headaches and nausea. The images showed numerous nonspecific, nonenhancing lesions measuring 8 mm in diameter in the bilateral periventricular and corona radiata white matter. Results of magnetic resonance angiography were normal. cyte sedimentation rate, levels of vitamin B12 and C-reactive protein, and antinuclear antibody titers were reportedly normal. A monospot test was negative, as was testing for Lyme disease and DNA for CADASIL cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarctsDr. Lax: The complete blood count, erythro-and leukoencephalopathy. The patient was seen by neurologists at a second hospital; he reportedly had no seizure disorder. When the patient was 13 years of age, laboratory testing revealed normal blood levels of total protein and albumin; other test results are shown in Table 1. Between 13 years 6 months of age and 14 years 6 months of age, the patients prothrombin-time international normalized ratio, lipid profile, and red-cell osmotic fragility were normal, as were blood levels of ceruloplas-min, iron, iron-binding capacity, IgG, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase G6PD and the 24-hour urinary copper level. A Coombs test, screening for celiac disease and Heinz bodies, and tests for hepatitis B and C viruses, antinuclear antibodies, antiliverkidney microsomal antibodies, and F-actin smooth-muscle antibodies were negative; other test results obtained in an outpatient clinic and at the second hospital are shown in Table 1. Hemoglobin electrophoresis revealed 97.3 hemoglobin A1 and 2.3 hemoglobin A2. Ophthalmologic examination revealed no evidence of retinopathy. The patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. The patient had a history of inguinal herni-orrhaphies and had undergone orchidopexy at 15 months of age. He also had had orthopedic injuries related to sports traumas. Results of a sweat test performed at 18 months of age, a bone-age study at 20 months of age, and a tongue biopsy at 12 years of age were reportedly normal. Medications included insulin by pump and levothyroxine. He had no known allergies to medications. He attended special-education classes in high school and lived with his parents and siblings. His mother and father were both of Italian and Irish ancestry. A maternal uncle had been born prematurely and had a history of learning disabilities, developmental delay, hypo-gammaglobulinemia that required infusions of intravenous immune globulin, cryptogenic cirrhosis that had been diagnosed when he was 30 years of age and was complicated by the hepatopulmonary syndrome, splenic-artery aneurysms, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and bone marrow failure; he died in his 40s. A maternal great-grandmother was reported to have sclero-derma that had developed when she was in her 80s, his paternal grandmother had type 1 diabetes mellitus that had developed when she was in her teens, his mother had Graves disease, his father had noninsulin-dependent diabetes melli-tus, and his teenage siblings were healthy. On examination, the patient had slight facial dysmorphism. His height was in the 32nd percentile, and his weight in the 33rd percentile. There was a white plaque with shallow ulceration on the tongue. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, with a palpable spleen three fin-gerbreadths below the left costal margin and no hepatomegaly. Blood levels of lactate and pyru-vate and sequence analysis of mitochondrial DNA polymerase  were normal. Results of additional blood tests that were performed at the second hospital when the patient was 14 years 8.5 months of age are shown in Table 1. Dr. Sharatz: Abdominal ultrasonography Fig. 1B and 1D, performed to evaluate for splenomegaly, revealed heterogeneous echotexture in the liver, with multiple hypoechoic nodules measuring 1 cm in diameter but no dominant mass. The spleen was enlarged measuring 14.8 cm in greatest dimension. Doppler ultrasonography Fig. 1C revealed normal hepatopetal flow of the portal and splenic veins and no evidence of splenic or gastroesophageal varices or ascites. MRI of the liver Fig. 1E and 1F, performed with and without the administration of intravenous gadolinium, revealed splenomegaly and heterogeneous hepatic enhancement, without a focal mass, bile-duct dilatation, or varices. Dr. Lax: Ursodiol was administered. Two months after the patient initially presented to the gastroenterology clinic, array comparative genomic hybridization testing revealed no notable copy-number changes. Three months after the patient initially presented to the gastroenter-ology clinic, he was electively admitted to this hospital for further evaluation of liver abnormalities. On admission, flow cytometry of the peripheral blood revealed 945 CD3 T cells per cubic millimeter reference range, 1000 to 2200, with normal absolute numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells, CD19 B cells, and natural killer cells. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Selective antibody deficiency. Atypical dyskeratosis congenita with immune dysfunction.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Emily R. Lynch Pediatrics: An 18-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of fever and pain in the lower abdomen, groin, and scrotum. The patient had been well until 4 days before admission, when fatigue, subjective fever, and chills developed. The next day, he began having headaches, non-bilious nonbloody emesis, diarrhea, decreased appetite, low back pain, and dysuria. On the day before admission, he was able to drink only one glass of water without vomiting. His mother brought him to the emergency department of this hospital. He reported dry mouth, eye pain when he was febrile, and light-headedness. He had a history of exercise-induced asthma and had been hospitalized during early childhood for diarrhea. He took no medications and had no known medication allergies. Immunizations were current. He lived with his mother, stepfather, and brother in an urban area of New England and attended high school. He was born in Central America, had moved to the United States at 15 years of age, and had not traveled outside the country since that time. The family had frequent visitors from Central America. The patient had had a negative interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculosis 2 months before this evaluation. He was sexually active with one female partner and reported consistent condom use. Two months earlier, tests for human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia had been negative. He smoked one cigarette each day, used marijuana three times per week, and drank alcohol intermittently. He had a pet rabbit but no contact with other animals, no history of recent tick or mosquito bites, and no contact with sick persons. There was no family history of renal stones or autoimmune disorders. On examination, the patient appeared to be tired. The temperature was 39.4C, the blood pressure 125/67 mm Hg, the pulse 121 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 36 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while he was breathing ambient air. The paraspinal muscles of the low back were tender. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of renal-function tests were normal, as were the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, red-cell indexes, and blood levels of amylase, lipase, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin; additional test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed 2 albumin and 1 ketones by dipstick; there were few squamous cells and very few transitional cells per high-power field, amorphous crystals, and mucin. Cultures of blood and urine were negative, as were tests for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and para-influenza virus types 1, 2, and 3 and urinary nucleic-acid tests for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, ondansetron, and ibuprofen were administered. During the next 4 hours, the fever, tachycardia, and pain resolved, and the patient was able to drink water without vomiting. He was discharged home and advised to continue taking acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and ondanse-tron, as well as to rest, drink fluids, and follow up with his primary care physician in 2 days. The next morning, the patient awoke with severe pain in the abdomen, groin, and scrotum on the left side. Light-headedness, dysuria, diarrhea, and nausea persisted, and he vomited after each attempt to eat or drink. He returned to the emergency department, where he rated his pain at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He reported that 3 weeks earlier, he had had testicular trauma while attempting a stunt jump on his bicycle; the pain had resolved after approximately 30 minutes. On examination, he appeared to be uncomfortable, lying still on the stretcher. The temperature was 37.5C, the blood pressure 127/61 mm Hg, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while he was breathing ambient air. There was tenderness of the left costovertebral angle, the left lower quadrant of the abdomen, the left inguinal crease, and the superior aspect of the left testicle; there was no scrotal mass, edema, or discoloration. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal, and the level of C-reactive protein was 162.7 mg per liter reference value, 8.0. Examination of the urine before and after prostatic massage revealed trace occult blood by dipstick in both samples, with otherwise normal results. Ultrasonography of the scrotum, kidneys, and bladder revealed an 8-mm cyst in the left epididymal head and no acute abnormalities. Ketorolac was administered. The patients pain persisted, and the temperature rose to 38.9C; acetaminophen was administered, and he was admitted to the hospital. On admission, the patient reported left scrotal pain and headache. His diarrhea had resolved. The temperature was 39.2C, the blood pressure 116/63 mm Hg, the pulse 104 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while he was breathing ambient air. There was mild tenderness of the anterior and posterior left thigh; results of the physical examination were otherwise unchanged from the assessment in the emergency department. Intravenous fluids, ketorolac, acetaminophen, and ondansetron were administered. The patients urine was strained after each void; no stones were found. On the second hospital day, vomiting resolved but fever persisted and pain of the abdomen and groin worsened; morphine was administered as needed. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Chandana Kurra: Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of contrast material Fig. 1A, revealed an ill-defined low-density material that tracked along the left retroperitoneum anterior to the left psoas muscle and aorta and into the pelvis, displacing the bladder to the right. Low-density material was also seen in the left para-colic gutter. The radiologic differential diagnosis included infectious and inflammatory causes with a possible pelvic, leg, or genitourinary source or traumatic injury to the bladder or ureter. There was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, and other visualized structures in the abdomen, pelvis, and lower thorax were normal. Dr. Lynch: On the third hospital day, the patient continued to receive morphine for pain and acetaminophen for fever. Abdominal ultrasonog-raphy revealed two enlarged left external iliac lymph nodes 0.8 cm and 0.7 cm in short-axis diameter and a heterogeneous, ill-defined, mixed echogenic collection located to the left of the bladder, a finding suggestive of loculated fluid or phlegmon. A chest radiograph was normal. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed normochromic normocytic red cells, occasional symmetrical spindle-shaped red cells with smooth contours, very few burr cells, very few teardrop-shaped red cells, normal lymphocytes and mono-cytes, and normal platelets with occasional large forms. Results of renal-function tests and of hemoglobin electrophoresis were normal, as were red-cell indexes and blood levels of amylase, lipase, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin. Tests for heterophile antibodies and IgM and IgG antibodies to Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Anaplasma phagocyto-philum, and Rickettsia rickettsii were negative, as was a polymerase-chain-reaction assay for A. phagocy-tophilum DNA; results of tests for antibodies to EpsteinBarr virus EBV and cytomegalovirus CMV were suggestive of past infection. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Ampicillin sulbactam and gentamicin were administered. On the fourth hospital day, the patients pain decreased and his fever resolved. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis of an unknown cause.

Retroperitoneal abscess: The CT scan showing low-density material tracking along the left retroperitoneum suggests a possible infectious or inflammatory source consistent with an abscess.\n\n3. Testicular torsion: The acute onset of severe scrotal pain and groin pain following a history of testicular trauma raises the possibility of testicular torsion, although the ultrasound findings make this less likely.\n\n4. Pyelonephritis: The left costovertebral angle tenderness, dysuria, and fever are indicative of possible pyelonephritis, particularly in the context of the patient's persistent urinary symptoms.\n\n5. Hernia: The presence of abdominal and groin pain with tenderness along the inguinal crease raises the concern for an inguinal hernia, although ultrasonography findings do not confirm it.\n\n6. Orchitis: Given the persistent fever, pain localized to the scrotum, and inguinal lymphadenopathy, orchitis, possibly secondary to a viral or bacterial infection, should be considered.\n\n7. Inguinal lymphadenitis: The ultrasonographic evidence of enlarged iliac lymph nodes and the patient's fever suggest an inflammatory or infectious process involving the inguinal lymph nodes.\n\n8. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's dysuria, potential presence of trace occult blood in urine analysis, and fever, despite negative cultures, are consistent with a possible UTI.\n\n9. Possible Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs): Although initial STI tests were negative, the patient's sexually active status requires re-evaluation for STIs, such as herpes, that may present atypically or have delayed seroconversion.\n\n10.

The patient had been in her usual health and able to perform normal activities of daily living including walking one block until 3 days before admission, when fatigue, anorexia, nausea, and dry heaves developed. On the day of admission, substernal chest discomfort occurred; she awoke in the late evening with pain in the upper chest that she rated at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain, with associated tightness, dyspnea, and nausea. On evaluation by emergency medical services personnel, the blood pressure was 116/80 mm Hg, the pulse 164 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute labored, and the oxygen saturation 97 while she was breathing ambient air. An electrocardiogram ECG showed tachycardia with a regular wide QRS complex. Amiodarone and ondansetron were administered intravenously; the pulse slowed to 100 beats per minute, and the chest pain and tightness diminished. When the patients daughter arrived at the emergency department of this hospital, she reported that 2.5 months before this admission, the patient had been admitted to another hospital for 1 day because of throat tightness and dyspnea. At that time, an ECG had shown sinus rhythm and left bundle-branch block, and cardiac telemetry had been negative. The troponin level had been elevated, at 0.06 ng per milliliter reference value, 0.03. A chest radiograph had shown small pleural effusions and hyperinflation. During that admission, a rash was noted; the patient had reported a history of intermittent rash or bruises on the face, neck, and trunk of approximately 3 years duration, with worsening during the previous 6 months. The acute symptoms resolved, and the patient was discharged the next day, with instructions to undergo transthoracic echocardiography and a stress test at an outpatient clinic and a biopsy of her rash by a dermatologist; none of these tests had been performed before she was admitted to this hospital. The patient had hypertension, long-standing bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and a history of colonic polyps. Medications were aspirin, calcium carbonate, vitamin D supplements, and biotin. She was allergic to sulfa drugs, which caused a rash. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She lived alone and her children lived nearby. Her father had had an abdominal aortic aneurysm; there was no other family history of cardiovascular or dermatologic disease. On examination, the patient was in respiratory distress and responded to questions with one- or two-word answers. The temperature was 36.6C, the blood pressure 109/69 mm Hg, the pulse 94 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 84 while she was breathing ambient air. She had jugular venous distention to 11 cm of water, poor air movement, diffuse bilateral lung crackles, and scattered purpuric lesions on the face, neck, trunk, and arms. The remainder of the examination was normal. Oxygen supplementation was administered through a nonrebreather face mask, and the oxygen saturation rose to higher than 90. An ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 81 beats per minute and left bundle-branch block. Dr. Michael T. Lu: A chest radiograph Fig. 1A showed patchy and confluent opacities in both lower lobes and small bilateral pleural effusions. These findings are compatible with pulmonary edema. Dr. Kattan: Blood levels of hemoglobin, urea nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, and lipase were normal, as were the platelet count, prothrombin time, and prothrombin-time international normalized ratio; other test results are shown in Table 1. Testing for influenza types A and B, hepatitis B and C viruses, and Lyme disease was negative. Urinalysis revealed slightly cloudy, yellow urine, with 1 protein by dipstick, squamous cells, and mucus. Cardiac ultrasonography, performed at the bedside in the emergency department, revealed decreased cardiac function, with poor visualization of the right ventricle and no evidence of pericardial effusion. Thoracic ultra-sonography revealed lung sliding and multiple B-line artifacts bilaterally. Bilevel positive airway pressure was administered but was discontinued when vomiting occurred. Aspirin, atorvastatin, furosemide, ondansetron, and morphine were administered, and a heparin infusion was begun. A cardiology consultation was obtained, and the patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit ICU 4 hours after presentation. On examination in the cardiac ICU, the patient appeared to be in respiratory distress and reported having air hunger. The respiratory rate was 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen satu-ration 93 while she was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute. There was trace edema of the legs. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. In the cardiac ICU, dyspnea persisted and fatigue increased. The blood levels of triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins, low-density lipopro-teins, glycated hemoglobin, vitamin B12, and folate were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. One dose of ticagrelor was administered, followed by a nitroglycerin infusion and doses of vancomycin, cefepime, and furosemide. Dr. Lu: A chest radiograph Fig. 1B showed progression of the multifocal opacities in the lungs and enlarging pleural effusions. These findings are compatible with worsening pulmonary edema. Dr. Mohammed Ali: Transthoracic echocardiog-raphy was performed to evaluate the ongoing chest pain and the shortness of breath that was associated with respiratory failure. The left ventricular systolic function was moderately impaired; the left ventricle had a normal size and increased wall thickness. The right ventricular size and systolic function were normal, and the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure was 46 mm Hg. The left atrium was enlarged, with thickening of the anterior and posterior mitral-valve leaflets and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation but no other valvular disease. Bilateral pleural effusions and a small pericardial effusion without hemodynamic significance were noted. Pulsed-wave Doppler imaging of the mi-tral valve revealed a restrictive filling pattern, with a very high early diastolic filling velocity E wave, a short deceleration time 130 msec, and a low late diastolic filling velocity A wave Fig. 2; and Video 1, available with full text of this article at NEJM.org. Dr. Kattan: Approximately 10 hours after the patients arrival in the cardiac ICU approximately 14 hours after presentation, she was sedated and paralyzed, and the trachea was electively intubated. Mechanical ventilation was initiated. Dr. Ali: Shortly thereafter, a pulmonary-artery catheter was inserted, and coronary-artery angiography revealed diffuse, minimal nonobstructive coronary artery disease. On hemodynamic assessment, the pressure was 13/11 mm Hg with a mean of 10 mm Hg in the right atrium, 487 mm Hg in the right ventricle, and 49/27 mm Hg with a mean of 34 mm Hg in the pulmonary artery; the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure was 25 mm Hg. Cardiac output, measured by means of thermo-dilution, was 2.9 liters per minute cardiac index, 1.7 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area. Additional furosemide was administered. Dr. Kattan: On the morning of the second day, the patient was breathing spontaneously, and the trachea was extubated. Cool oxygen was admin-istered through a face tent at a concentration of 40. Indirect immunofluorescence testing for antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies ANCA was negative, as was testing for antibodies to proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase. On the third day, the blood iron level was 16 g per deciliter 3 mol per liter; reference range, 30 to 160 g per deciliter 5 to 29 mol per liter, the blood iron-binding capacity was 196 g per deciliter 35 mol per liter; reference range, 230 to 404 g per deciliter 41 to 72 mol per liter, and the total complement level was 191 U per milliliter reference range, 63 to 145. Levels of C3, C4, ferritin, and thyrotropin were normal, and testing for antinuclear antibodies ANA, human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, celiac disease, and cryoproteins was negative. The patient was transferred to the cardiac telemetry unit. Analysis of a urine specimen revealed a high level of kappa Bence Jones protein in three molecular forms, as well as trace albumin. A dermatology consultation was obtained to evaluate the rash. Dr. Daniel Y. Sugai Dermatology: On examination of the skin, there were purpuric and ecchy-motic plaques, macules, and papules on the face particularly affecting the perioral region, neck, trunk, and arms Fig. 3, as well as violaceous macules on the dorsal and lateral tongue and perianal ecchymoses. There was no purpura around the eyes after pinching pinch purpura and no macroglossia. The conjunctivae were clear, and the nails were normal. Dr. Kattan: A diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Systemic amyloidosis. ", "prediction": "1. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure: The patient presents with signs of pulmonary edema, jugular venous distention, and bilateral pleural effusions indicative of fluid overload likely due to heart failure exacerbation.\n2. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient's history of chest pain, dyspnea, nausea, and elevated troponin levels warrants evaluation for ischemic heart disease.\n3. Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy/Dysplasia: The ECG showing a wide QRS complex and later LBBB along with a history of arrhythmia could suggest an underlying cardiomyopathy.\n4. Cardiac Amyloidosis: The presence of pleural effusions, restrictive filling pattern on echocardiography, and purpuric lesions are consistent with amyloidosis, affecting multiple organs.\n5. Pulmonary Embolism: Given the dyspnea, hypoxemia, and tachycardia, a pulmonary embolism could present similarly to the patient's symptoms.\n6. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: The intermittent rash, history of pleurisy, and various systemic symptoms raise suspicion for lupus or another connective tissue disease.\n7. Sepsis: The patient received broad-spectrum antibiotics and exhibits signs of systemic inflammation and possible infection, which could account for the acute presentation.\n8. Multiple Myeloma: The presence of Bence Jones proteins in the urine and anemia could signify multiple myeloma, particularly aligned with systemic symptoms and rash.\n9. Drug-Induced Lupus: Considering the rash and systemic symptoms in a patient with a known medication history, a drug reaction could be contributing to her clinical picture.\n10. Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis: The chest findings of multifocal opacities and patient’s shortness of breath could be due to an allergic reaction leading to an inflammatory lung condition."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Patricia M. Guglietta: A 9.5-year-old girl with chronic constipation was seen in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital because of recurrent episodes of abdominal pain with associated nonbilious vomiting. The patient had been generally well until she was 4 years of age, when occasional episodes of abdominal pain began to occur. These episodes, which occurred a few times per year and were separated by asymptomatic periods, were sometimes associated with constipation or nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting. Neither fevers nor diarrhea occurred. The patients family reported the symptoms during routine annual examinations or other scheduled or urgent appointments at a health center affiliated with this hospital. Polyethylene glycol was administered intermittently for constipation, with improvement. When the patient was 8 years of age, a sudden episode of sharp pain on the left side of the chest occurred, with associated tachycardia and nausea, in the absence of precipitating factors. On examination at school, the pulse was 150 beats per minute; at the health center, the temperature and the remainder of the physical examination were normal, as were a chest radiograph and an electrocardiogram. The patient returned home. Results of a cardiologic evaluation that was performed 2 months later were normal. During the next 18 months, the episodes of abdominal pain became more frequent up to three or four times weekly and occurred more often when the patient was at school than during weekends. The pain was typically epigastric and associated with vomiting. On evaluation when the patient was 8 years 7 months of age, a urine culture was sterile, serologic testing for Helicobacter pylori infection was negative, and an abdominal radiograph showed no evidence of obstruction. Polyethylene glycol and omeprazole were administered; the constipation transiently diminished when the medications were taken regularly. When the patient was 9 years 4 months of age, she was seen at an urgent care clinic because of sharp, crampy epigastric pain. Examination revealed a normal temperature, mild diffuse abdominal tenderness, fullness in the left lower quad-rant that was consistent with the presence of stool, and no abdominal guarding or rebound tenderness. Therapy with the laxative was resumed, and constipation diminished; however, abdominal pain recurred intermittently thereafter, along with vomiting, which gave partial pain relief. One month later, a physical examination was normal. A complete blood count and white-cell differential count were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, free thyroxine, and thyrotropin and results of renal- and liver-function tests; testing for H. pylori infection and celiac disease was negative. Abdominal radiography was performed. Dr. Pallavi Sagar: The abdominal radiograph Fig. 1 showed a nonobstructive bowel-gas pattern and a moderate-to-abundant amount of stool distributed in the colon, particularly in the ascending colon; these findings are consistent with the clinical history of constipation. There was a normal distribution of bowel gas and no evidence of abnormal mass effect or intraab-dominal calcifications. Dr. Guglietta: Therapy with omeprazole was initiated. The patient was referred to the pediatric gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. The patient and her family reported that the sharp, intermittent epigastric pain was sometimes associated with and partly relieved by nonbloody, nonbilious emesis and was not associated with or relieved by defecation. The patient had chronic constipation; the stools were hard and passed with straining, without blood, mucus, grease, tenesmus, urgency, cramping, or diarrhea. Constipation had resolved with the regular administration of polyethylene glycol and lactulose, and epigastric pain had diminished with omeprazole therapy. The patient had a history of asthma and had had pneumonia at 2 years of age. She had no mouth sores, fevers, or joint pains. Her growth was normal. She had no known allergies. Her diet was relatively low in fiber, with few vegetables and fruits. She lived with her parents and attended school; she was an excellent student. She was of South American ancestry and had traveled to South America when she was 8 years of age. Her father had gastro-esophageal reflux disease, a sister had hyperthyroidism, and her maternal grandmother and aunts had migraines; there was no family history of celiac disease, Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, or the irritable bowel syndrome. On examination, the patient had a shy and somewhat anxious demeanor. The blood pressure was normal, the height 130.3 cm 19th percentile, and the weight 28.6 kg 28th percentile. The epigastrium was tender, without abdominal guarding, rebound tenderness, or stool loading; the remainder of the examination was normal. Analysis of the stool for H. pylori antigen was negative. Omeprazole therapy was stopped after a 2-month course. At a follow-up visit in the gastroenterology clinic 6 weeks after the initial visit, the patient and her family reported that the epigastric pain had recurred approximately weekly, despite the omeprazole therapy; the pain was associated with vomiting and appeared to be unrelated to stress or defecation. The patient passed stools once or twice per day that were formed, with mucus and without blood. She had no nocturnal pain, headaches, or morning nausea. On examination, there was epigastric tenderness just beneath the xiphoid process; the abdomen was otherwise soft and nontender, with no mass in the left lower quadrant to suggest stool loading. The remainder of the examination was normal. One month later, an abdominal ultrasound image was normal. Esophagogastroduodenos-copy was performed; although there was suspicion for duodenitis, pathological examination of biopsy specimens of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, total protein, globulin, amylase, and lipase and results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal. All medications were discontinued. A diagnosis of abdominal migraine was considered, and the patient was referred to a neurologist; an appointment was scheduled for 4 months later. During the next 2 months, the frequency of abdominal pain increased, and the patient began to have fits of pain at school and at home, during which she was pale, had diaphoresis, and fell on the floor. Her symptoms partially improved when she bent over and held her abdomen. Results of an examination by her pediatrician were unchanged. Therapy with omeprazole and polyethylene glycol was reinitiated, and amitriptyline therapy for abdominal migraine was begun. At 9 years 11 months of age, an episode of unrelenting severe abdominal pain occurred that began in the left upper and left lower quadrants and radiated to the back. On the third day of the episode, the patient was seen by her pediatrician at the health center. The examination was normal; the abdomen was soft and nontender. There was a lack of response to the initial dosage of amitriptyline, so the dosage was increased. The patient was referred to a mental health consultant for instruction regarding biofeedback and relaxation techniques. An additional study was performed at the request of the patients parents, and a diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Chronic recurrent abdominal pain caused by intermittent torsion of an accessory spleen. ", "prediction": "1. Functional Abdominal Pain: Given the normal physical, endoscopic, and laboratory examinations, functional abdominal pain, particularly abdominal migraine, is a strong consideration, especially with the associated episodic nature and family history of migraines.\n2. Chronic Constipation: The presence of moderate-to-abundant stool in the colon on abdominal radiography and relief of symptoms with laxatives suggest that chronic constipation is a significant contributor to the patient’s symptoms.\n3. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The episodic epigastric pain relieved by vomiting and partial relief with omeprazole therapy are indicative of GERD.\n4. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): The chronic, recurring abdominal pain associated with changes in bowel habits (constipation) aligns with the symptoms of IBS, despite the absence of diarrhea.\n5. Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome (CVS): The pattern of recurrent vomiting episodes separated by symptom-free periods is characteristic of CVS.\n6. Psychosomatic Pain: The patient’s shy and somewhat anxious demeanor, along with a lack of association with stress or defecation, raises the possibility of psychosomatic pain.\n7. Pediatric Gastroparesis: The recurrent vomiting along with the abdominal pain could be due to delayed gastric emptying, despite the normal endoscopic findings.\n8. Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis: Although biopsy results were normal, eosinophilic gastroenteritis remains a consideration due to episodic abdominal pain and vomiting.\n9. Food Intolerance: The girl's diet low in fiber and the weekly recurrence of symptoms might suggest an intolerance to certain foods or additives.\n10. Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD): Despite normal endoscopic and biopsy results, the history of epigastric pain relieved by vomiting suggests a possible peptic ulcer disease, although less likely given the patient’s age and negative test results for H. pylori."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Jacob Lazarus Medicine: A 58-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital during the summer because of an ulcerated lesion on the forehead, fever, and cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient had been well until 8 days before admission, when she noted a pimplelike lesion on the left side of her forehead, near the hairline. She squeezed a scant amount of clear fluid from the lesion. Over the next 3 days, the lesion increased in size. Five days before admission, the patient awoke with a temperature of 39.4C, chills, myalgias, and malaise. She went to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. Blood levels of calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, and total bilirubin were normal, as were the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, red-cell indexes, anion gap, and results of renal-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was discharged home and was advised to rest and take acetaminophen. Temperatures as high as 40.0C, chills, and myalgias persisted. The patient felt weak, had a reduced appetite, and noted tender swelling of the left side of her neck. The lesion on the forehead continued to enlarge, took on the appearance of a blister containing dark fluid, and then ulcerated; redness and swelling surrounding the lesion developed. Two days before admission, the patient returned to the other hospital. The red-cell indexes, anion gap, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, and total bilirubin. A urinalysis showed trace glucose, 1 ketones, 2 occult blood, and 3 protein by dipstick, as well as a specific gravity of 1.025 and a pH of 6.5; there were 25 to 50 red cells and 2 to 5 white cells per high-power field. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Specimens of blood and urine were sent for culture. A chest radiograph was normal, and additional imaging studies were performed. Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography CT of the head and neck revealed substantial asymmetric lymphadenopathy involving the head, face, and neck on the left side Fig. 1A. Enlarged lymph nodes were identified in the left postauricular region, in the left submandibular region, along the left anterior and posterior cervical chains, and in the supraclavicular region. Inferior to the angle of the left mandible, a pair of nodes was identified that displaced the left submandibular gland Fig. 1B. These nodes were hypodense centrally, and there was substantial infiltration of the surrounding fat. Many of the nodes had contrast enhancement. These findings suggest-ed an inflammatory process. A 4-mm hypodense lesion was also seen in the left lobe of the thyroid gland. Dr. Lazarus: Intravenous clindamycin was administered. The patient was discharged home with a prescription for oral clindamycin. One day before admission, the patient was seen for a follow-up appointment at the otolaryn-gology clinic of the other hospital. She reported that she continued to feel unwell and that the lesion on her forehead had further enlarged and was painful. Continued administration of oral clindamycin was recommended; the patient was advised to apply hydrogen peroxide and antibiotic ointment to the lesion and to return to the emergency department if her fevers did not abate. The next day, the patient returned to the emergency department of the other hospital and reported a temperature of 39.4C and persistent myalgias and malaise. Standing and walking had become difficult because of fatigue and weakness. On examination, the patient was alert and in no acute distress, and the vital signs were within normal limits. There was an ulcerated lesion measuring 4 cm by 2 cm on the forehead, with a central eschar and surrounding edema, as well as marked swelling of the left side of the neck. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Blood levels of lactic acid, calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, and total bilirubin were normal, as were the red-cell indexes, anion gap, and results of renal-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Specimens of blood were sent for culture. A chest radiograph was normal. Additional antibiotics were administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred to this hospital by ambulance. On admission, the patient reported a mild frontal headache. She had a remote history of a cesarean section. Her only medications were acetaminophen and clindamycin, and she had no known allergies. She lived with her husband and dog and was a homemaker. During the 2 months before the onset of illness, she had been living in a wooded area of coastal New England; she took frequent walks to ponds and to the beach, kayaked, and had seen deer, skunks, and rabbits. Several months before the onset of illness, she had taken a hiking trip in southern California. The patient was monogamous with her husband, consumed alcohol in moderation, did not smoke or use illicit drugs, and had no exposure to sick persons. A sister had systemic lupus erythematosus, and other family members had hypertension, cataracts, and glaucoma. On examination, the patient was in no acute distress. The temperature was 38.0°C, the pulse 107 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126//68 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. There was an ulcer (measuring 4 cm by 2 cm) at the hairline, just to the left of the midline; the center of the ulcer was white, the borders were black and slightly raised, and the skin around the lesion was mildly erythematous, edematous, and tender (Figure 2A). Left cervical lymphadenopathy with firm, tender, mobile nodes was present; the largest lymph nodes were a submandibular lymph node that was 3 cm in diameter, anterior cervical lymph nodes that were 2 cm and 1 cm in diameter, and a posterior auricular lymph node that was 1 cm in diameter (Figure 2B). A systolic murmur (grade 2/6) was heard at the right upper sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The red-cell indexes, anion gap, results of renal-function tests, and blood levels of calcium and magnesium were normal. Urinalysis showed 1+ glucose, 1+ occult blood, and 2+ albumin by dipstick, as well as a specific gravity of 1.017 and a pH of 6.0; on microscopic examination, 1+ renal tubular cells and mucin were seen. The results of other laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Specimens of blood and urine were sent for culture. Normal saline and broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered intravenously.Additional tests were performed, and a diagnosis was made. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Ulceroglandular tularemia. ", "prediction": "1. Bacterial skin infection (Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus species): The presentation of an ulcerated lesion on the forehead with surrounding erythema and edema, along with systemic symptoms of fever and malaise, is highly suggestive of a bacterial skin infection.\n2. Lyme disease: Given her exposure to wooded areas in New England and the presence of systemic symptoms coupled with an ulcerated lesion, Lyme disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, transmitted by deer ticks, is a strong consideration.\n3. Cat scratch disease (Bartonella henselae): The presence of ulcerated skin lesions and significant lymphadenopathy could be due to cat scratch disease, especially considering exposure to animals.\n4. Tularemia: The patient's history of outdoor activities in endemic areas and the ulceroglandular presentation are consistent with tularemia caused by Francisella tularensis.\n5. Cutaneous anthrax: The ulcerated lesion with a central eschar, extensive surrounding edema, and systemic symptoms are characteristic of cutaneous anthrax.\n6. Fungal infection (Sporotrichosis): Sporotrichosis could present with ulcerated skin lesions and lymphadenitis, particularly if there was any history of gardening or contact with soil.\n7. Mycobacterial infection (Mycobacterium marinum or atypical mycobacteria): Given her outdoor activities and water exposure, a mycobacterial infection could cause a chronic ulcerated lesion and lymphadenopathy.\n8. Viral infection (Herpes Simplex Virus): HSV can present as painful ulcerated skin lesions with systemic symptoms, although the rapid progression to ulceration makes this less likely.\n9. Nocardiosis: Immunocompromised status or not, Nocardia species can cause chronic ulcerative skin and systemic symptoms and should be considered.\n10. Leishmaniasis: Though less likely given the geographic location, given her travel to endemic areas, cutaneous leishmaniasis should be considered if there was any exposure to sandflies."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Sarah K. Bourne Neurosurgery: A 43-year-old man with a history of alcohol-use disorder was admitted to this hospital because of altered mental status. On the day of admission, the patient was found by emergency medical services personnel, who had been contacted by a neighbor. He was sitting on a mattress, was incontinent of feces and urine, and was surrounded by empty prescription containers for gabapentin and bupropion, along with empty bottles of vodka. He had last been seen by neighbors 4 days earlier, when he reportedly locked himself in his apartment after purchasing alcohol. No other drugs or drug paraphernalia were found. On examination, he was conscious and shaking and did not speak or follow commands. The initial score on the Glasgow Coma Scale was 10 on a scale ranging from 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating reduced levels of consciousness. The blood pressure was 2361/58 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute. The lungs were clear. Glucometer readings of fingerstick capillary blood specimens reported an error. He required assistance to stand and walk to the stretcher. He was brought by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.1C, the blood pressure 2161/00 mm Hg, the pulse 76 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert but unable to give his name, answer questions, or follow commands. The score on the Glasgow Coma Scale was 11 4 for spontaneous eye opening, 2 for incomprehensible sounds, and 5 for response to pain. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. No papilledema was present. He was able to track and regard the examiner. The face was symmetric. Cough and gag reflex were present. He moved his limbs spontaneously and against gravity. Deep-tendon reflexes were normal, plantar reflexes were flexor bilaterally, and there was no Hoffmans reflex a relatively nonspecific sign in which tapping of the nail or flicking of the terminal phalanx of the middle or ring finger leads to flexion of the terminal phalanx of the thumb that can herald upper motor neuron disease. A few beats of ankle clonus were present. The skin was cool and slightly pale, and the remainder of the examination was normal, with no evidence of head trauma or other injury. An electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. The he-matocrit, hemoglobin level, platelet count, and results of coagulation and renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate amino-transferase, direct bilirubin, lipase, amylase, lactic acid, troponin T, and N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide; other test results are shown in Table 1. Toxicologic screening of blood and urine was negative. Cultures of blood and urine were obtained. Lactulose was administered through a nasogastric tube, and intravenous normal saline and haloperidol were administered. Dr. Mykol Larvie: Computed tomography CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material approximately 2.5 hours after the patients arrival in the emergency department, revealed enlargement of the lateral ventricles and periventricular hypodensity, findings suggestive of hydrocephalus related to obstruction at the foramen of Monro. There was also a heterogeneous, partially hyperdense intra-ventricular lesion involving the ependyma, with a focus in the anterior horn of the left lateral ventricle measuring approximately 2 cm Fig. 1A and other components involving the third ventricle. There was no intracranial hemorrhage or large infarction. Approximately 5 hours after the patients arrival, magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head was performed before and after the intravenous administration of contrast material Fig. 1B through 1F. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR images revealed marked enlargement of the lateral ventricles and prominent periventricular hyperintensity that reflected transependymal flow of the cerebrospi-nal fluid CSF, a feature consistent with acute hydrocephalus. T1-weighted images revealed enhancing lesions involving the ependyma of the anterior horn of the left lateral ventricle that extended toward the foramen of Monro. A smooth and nodular enhancing lesion extended into and partially filled the third ventricle. There was mildly restricted diffusion in the enhancing lesion, including the nodular component in the left lateral ventricle. Given the heterogeneous enhancement, some of which had corresponding restricted diffusion, infection and cancer were the principal diagnostic considerations. Dr. Bourne: A right transfrontal external ventricular drain was placed while the patient was in the trauma bay. The opening pressure was 24 mm Hg normal value, 11. Results of CSF analysis are shown in Table 1. Bacterial and fungal cultures were obtained, and vancomycin was administered. The patient was admitted to the neurology intensive care unit ICU. During the next 3 days, one of two sets of blood cultures in aerobic bottles grew gram-positive cocci, which were identified as Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Aerococcus viridans, and probable S. sciuri; repeat cultures were negative, as were cultures of the urine and CSF. Examination of sputum specimens revealed squamous cells and mixed bacteria, with no evidence of acid-fast bacilli. Blood levels of thyrotropin, free thyroxine, insulin-like growth factor 1, and angiotensin-converting enzyme were normal, and testing for anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, cryptococcal antigens, and IgG antibodies to echinococcus and Taenia solium which causes cysticercosis were negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Cefepime, folate, thiamine, and cyanocobala-min were administered. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed fatty infiltration of the liver and borderline splenomegaly. A feeding tube was inserted. A tuberculin skin test was negative. An electroencephalogram showed frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity and frequent irregular left hemispheric delta slowing amid diffuse deltatheta background slowing, without evidence of overt electrographic or clinical seizure activity. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 49, mild global hypokinesis of the left ventricle, and no evidence of valvular vegetations. The patient remained afebrile. The transduced intra-cranial pressure ranged from 7 to 15 mm Hg. On examination, the patient opened his eyes to voice, had dysconjugate gaze, and did not track or follow commands. The pupils were equal and reactive, and he blinked in response to threat. He withdrew his arms and legs from pain and had antigravity strength. The reflexes were symmetric, and plantar reflexes were flexor. A family member was identified and contacted. The next day, patient data from another clinic revealed a history of chronic lower back pain and hepatitis C virus infection, and the patient had had a possible retinal abnormality 1 year earlier. There was no known history of human immunodeficiency virus HIV infection or diabetes mel-litus. His medications were gabapentin and bu-propion. He was allergic to penicillin. He was single, lived alone, had been incarcerated in the past, and had few friends. He smoked cigarettes, drank 1 liter of hard alcohol daily, and reportedly did not use illicit drugs. His mother had died of hypertension and kidney disease, a brother had reportedly died after a stroke while withdrawing from alcohol, and his father had hypertension. On the fifth day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Obstructive hydrocephalus due to infiltration of the ventricular lining by an infection or tumor. ", "prediction": "1. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: The patient's history of heavy alcohol use, tremors, agitation, and altered mental status suggests alcohol withdrawal syndrome.\n2. Gabapentin and bupropion overdose: Empty prescription containers and altered mental status could indicate toxicity or overdose of these medications.\n3. Hydrocephalus: Imaging revealed marked enlargement of the lateral ventricles and periventricular hyperintensity, consistent with acute hydrocephalus.\n4. CNS infection: The presence of enhancing lesions in the brain and the need for vancomycin point to a potential central nervous system infection.\n5. Central nervous system neoplasm: The MRI findings of heterogeneous enhancing lesions with restricted diffusion raise the possibility of brain cancer.\n6. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the history of fatty liver infiltration, altered mental status could be due to hepatic encephalopathy.\n7. Meningoencephalitis: The MRI findings, elevated intracranial pressure, and symptoms could be consistent with an inflammatory or infectious process in the CNS.\n8. Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Despite no intracranial hemorrhage on the initial CT, altered mental status and headache could indicate a small bleed undetectable on initial imaging.\n9. Thiamine deficiency (Wernicke's encephalopathy): Chronic alcohol use and altered mental status could lead to this condition.\n10. Electrolyte imbalance: Alcohol use and poor nutritional status might lead to imbalances like hyponatremia or hypokalemia, contributing to the patient's symptoms."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Hasan Merali Pediatrics: A 10-year-old boy was seen in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital because of intermittent abdominal cramping and fevers. The patient had been well until approximately 3 weeks before this presentation, when intermittent fevers to a temperature of 39.7C occurred, followed by episodes of cramping in the periumbilical and subumbilical abdominal regions, without vomiting. He had one or two bowel movements daily; the stools were formed, and hematochezia had occurred on one or two occasions. He had reportedly been unable to attend school for 2.5 weeks. Two days before this presentation, he was seen in the emergency department of another hospital. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, albumin, amylase, lipase, and urea nitrogen were normal, as were urinalysis and results of liver-function tests. Screening tests for celiac disease and EpsteinBarr virus infection were negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. S. Reha Butros: Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis Fig. 1A and 1B, performed after the administration of contrast material, revealed circumferential, moderate thickening of a long segment of the colonic wall at the hepatic flexure and adjacent mesenteric lymphadenopathy with the largest lymph node measuring 1.2 cm in diameter, with no surrounding fat stranding. No dilated loops of bowel were present to suggest bowel obstruction or any other areas of bowel-wall thickening. The appendix was normal, and there was no abscess formation. Dr. Merali: The patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. He reportedly had had intermittent, mild, self-resolving abdominal pain throughout childhood that was associated with diarrhea and was thought to be caused by lactose intolerance. He reported having a stable weight while he was consuming a regular diet which included dairy and occasional headaches but no joint pains or mouth sores. He had had frequent bouts of acute pharyngitis strep throat during early childhood and had undergone a tonsillectomy at 19 months of age and sinus surgery in the past. His immunizations were current; he took no medications and had no known allergies. He was a student and lived with his parents. His father had hypertension and hypercholester-olemia, his fathers cousin had Crohns disease, and a paternal uncle and great-grandfather had had colon cancer at 60 and 65 years of age, respectively. Both grandmothers had diabetes mellitus, and other relatives had heart disease. On examination, the patient appeared to be healthy and was in no distress. The blood pres-sure was 136/76 mm Hg, the pulse 84 beats per minute, the weight 48.6 kg, and the height 151.4 cm; his weight and height were both at the 96th percentile for his age. The abdomen was soft and nontender, with no organomegaly. Dr. Butros: An abdominal radiograph, obtained with the patient in an upright position, showed a normal bowel-gas pattern, and no dilated loops of bowel were present to suggest obstruction. Ultrasonography of the abdomen Fig. 1C revealed circumferential, marked thickening of a long segment of the colonic wall at the hepatic flexure and adjacent mesenteric lymphadenopa-thy. Color Doppler imaging studies showed increased blood flow in the affected segment of the colon. Dr. Merali: Additional follow-up was scheduled. During the next 10 days, the pain became more constant; the patient reported pain that waxed and waned between 5 and 10 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain and occasional, brief pain-free intervals that lasted minutes. The pain varied in quality between cramping and sharp and was located below the umbilicus in both lower quadrants, with occasional radiation to the epigastrium and lower back. Eating increased the pain, and the patient lost approximately 3 kg of weight over several weeks. Hematochezia became more frequent. Intermittent fevers and associated night sweats occurred. There was no improvement with ibuprofen or acetaminophen; the combination of acetaminophen and codeine caused increased stomach distress, and a cold pack occasionally helped to decrease this discomfort. Eleven days after the patient presented to the gastroenterology clinic, his family called because of another episode of abdominal pain and associated low-grade fever. The family declined to have the patient seen urgently in the clinic. Diphenhydramine was prescribed, and the patients family was advised to contact the clinician if symptoms worsened. Two weeks after the patients initial presentation, he was seen at a scheduled follow-up appointment. Results of liver-function tests and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, urea nitrogen, calcium, magnesium, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "The constitutional mismatch-repair deficiency syndrome and stage III adenocarcinoma of the colon. ", "prediction": "1. Crohn's Disease: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, intermittent fevers, hematochezia, weight loss, and family history of Crohn's disease support this diagnosis.\n2. Ulcerative Colitis: The presence of hematochezia and continuous abdominal pain with colonic wall thickening are consistent with this inflammatory bowel disease.\n3. Infectious Colitis: The fever, abdominal pain, and hematochezia might be due to a bacterial infection like Salmonella or Campylobacter leading to colitis.\n4. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): The intermittent cramping, normal stool consistency, and past diagnosis of lactose intolerance suggest this functional gastrointestinal disorder.\n5. Mesenteric Adenitis: The significant mesenteric lymphadenopathy observed on imaging could be from reactive lymphadenopathy secondary to a gastrointestinal or systemic infection.\n6. Intestinal Tuberculosis: Chronic abdominal symptoms, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy can be indicative of gastrointestinal tuberculosis, especially if there is contact with high-risk environments.\n7. Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP): This vasculitis can present with abdominal pain, hematochezia, and was associated with previous pharyngitis episodes.\n8. Intestinal Lymphoma: Persistent abdominal pain, weight loss, fever, and lymphadenopathy might indicate a malignancy such as lymphoma affecting the gastrointestinal tract.\n9. Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF): Recurrent fevers, abdominal pain, and a family history of autoimmune diseases point towards this hereditary inflammatory disorder.\n10. Celiac Disease: Despite a negative initial screening, the chronic symptoms and gastrointestinal disturbances necessitate further genetic or serological evaluation for celiac disease."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Amulya Nagarur Medicine: An 80-year-old man with end-stage renal disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease, hypertension, coronary arteriosclerosis, congestive heart failure, abdominal aortic aneurysm, hyperlipidemia, and gout was admitted to this hospital because of anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and an ileocecal mass. Three years before this admission, the patient had been seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of neck pain. Computed tomography CT of the neck revealed evidence of degenerative disk disease of the cervical spine and a pulmonary nodule 8 mm in diameter in the left upper lobe. Dr. Shaunagh McDermott: Three months after that initial visit, follow-up CT of the chest was performed, and the nodule in the left upper lobe had not changed in size. Five months after the initial visit, combined 18F-fluorodeoxyglucosepositron-emission tomography and CT FDG-PETCT revealed that the pulmonary nodule had increased in size to 1 cm in diameter, was tethered to the overlying pleura in the left upper lobe, and had increased FDG uptake; a contiguous nodule 7 mm in diameter with increased FDG uptake and new nodules in the right middle lobe were also present. In addition, there was intense diffuse FDG uptake in the stomach, as well as wall thickening of the most distal aspect of the terminal ileum and the cecum in the region of the ileocecal valve, with adjacent inflammatory fat stranding Fig. 1. Dr. Nagarur: Lung biopsy, upper endoscopy, and colonoscopy were recommended, but the patient declined to undergo these procedures. Approximately 9 months after the initial visit, induration 8 mm in diameter developed at the site of a tuberculin skin test that had been performed during a hemodialysis appointment at an outpatient care unit. Chest radiography was performed; pulmonary lesions were not noted. Eleven months after the initial visit 25 months before this admission, severe abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant and pain in the right flank developed acutely, and the patient presented to the emergency department at this hospital. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. McDermott: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material Fig. 2A, revealed a hema-toma in the right anterior pararenal space that arose from a subcapsular hematoma in the right kidney, with extravasation of blood into the ret-roperitoneal space. In addition, the soft-tissue mass at the ileocecal junction had increased in size. Dr. Nagarur: The patient was admitted to the hospital, and coil embolization of the right renal artery was performed. On the fourth hospital day, a colonoscopy was performed, and a nonob-structive fungating mass 4 cm by 2 cm was visualized at the ileocecal valve Fig. 3. Examination of a biopsy specimen of the mass showed severely active chronic colitis with fibrinopuru-lent exudate. On the 11th hospital day, colonoscopy was repeated and upper endoscopy was performed. In addition to the ileocecal mass, there were a few small inflammatory nodules with a patchy distribution in the lower two thirds of the esophagus, an oozing cratered ulcer in the gastric body with a visible vessel that was clipped, a few nonbleeding superficial ulcers in the gastric antrum, and diffuse, moderately erythematous mucosa in the duodenal bulb. Histopathological examination of biopsy specimens revealed erosive gastritis with reactive foveolar hyperplasia and markedly active chronic ileitis and ileocolitis with ulceration and non-necrotizing granulomas; no fungal forms or acid-fast bacilli were seen. The patient was discharged home while taking omeprazole. Eight weeks after that discharge approximately 23 months before this admission, the patient was seen in the gastroenterology clinic at this hospital. He reported having two or three bowel movements each day, with formed stools and without blood or pain during defecation. He had a reduced appetite but no abdominal pain. The weight was 65.3 kg decreased from 78.0 kg 3 years earlier, and the abdominal examination was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 67 mm per hour reference range, 0 to 13, and the C-reactive protein level was 55.5 mg per liter reference value, 8.0. The dose of omepra-zole was increased. Approximately 19 months before this admission, 2 weeks after the patient was discharged from a hospital stay for pacemaker placement, he was seen in the primary care clinic with a 5-day history of diarrhea, lower abdominal pain, and tenderness. The weight was 59.3 kg. A stool culture was negative for enteric pathogens, and a test for Clostridium difficile was positive. A 10-day course of oral metronidazole was prescribed; the frequency of diarrhea initially decreased but returned to three or four times a day after the medication was stopped. A 14-day course of oral vancomycin was prescribed, and the symptoms abated. Sixteen months before this admission, severe abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant de-veloped acutely, and the patient presented to the emergency department at this hospital. He reported feeling weak; the right lower quadrant was tender on palpation. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. McDermott: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed persistent irregular wall thickening of the terminal ileum, with mild adjacent inflammatory fat stranding Fig. 2B. Dr. Nagarur: Hemodialysis was performed, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Cipro-floxacin and metronidazole were administered, and the abdominal pain improved during the next 3 days. A stool culture and examinations for ova and parasites were negative, and a test for C. difficile was positive; ciprofloxacin was discontinued, and the patient was discharged with a prescription for a 14-day course of oral metro-nidazole. Thirteen months before this admission, the patient returned to the gastroenterology clinic. He reported that he had had three or four loose, nonbloody bowel movements each day for several weeks, with associated generalized abdominal pain. His appetite continued to be reduced, and he felt weak and fatigued. The weight was 55.8 kg, and the abdominal examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. McDermott: CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis had been performed 2 days before this visit to the gastroenterology clinic, during routine follow-up after a recent endovas-cular procedure for the repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The imaging studies revealed an increase in the circumferential wall thickening of the terminal ileum and cecum Fig. 2C. Dr. Nagarur: A diagnosis of Crohns disease was considered. Treatment with prednisone and methotrexate was recommended, but the patient declined the treatment. Eleven weeks before this admission, generalized weakness, diffuse abdominal discomfort and tenderness, and hypo-tension developed during an outpatient hemodi-alysis session. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and fever to a temperature of 38.4C developed. Cefepime and vancomycin were administered intravenously. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. McDermott: CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed increased diffuse wall thickening of the terminal ileum and cecum, with persistent mesenteric fat stranding and lymphadenopathy Fig. 2D. Dr. Nagarur: By the third hospital day, the fever had resolved and the abdominal pain had improved but diarrhea had developed; a test for C. difficile was again positive. Cefepime and van-comycin were discontinued. The patient was discharged home with prescriptions for budesonide, a 4-week course of ciprofloxacin and metronida-zole, and a 6-week tapering course of oral van-comycin. Three and a half weeks before this admission, the patient underwent endarterectomies of the right common femoral artery and the right superficial femoral artery at this hospital. Diarrhea and tenderness of the right lower quadrant developed postoperatively. The patient was uncertain whether he had been taking the budesonide and oral vancomycin that had been prescribed during his most recent hospitalization. Urinalysis revealed cloudy urine with 3 leukocyte esterase, 3 occult blood, 2 albumin, and negative nitrites by dipstick, as well as more than 100 white cells and 20 to 50 red cells per high-power field. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. McDermott: CT of the abdomen revealed persistent circumferential wall thickening of the terminal ileum and cecum and extensive adjacent fat stranding that had increased slightly since previous imaging studies had been obtained Fig. 2E. Dr. Nagarur: On the sixth hospital day, a bowel movement contained blood; a test for C. difficile was negative. The patient was discharged home on the seventh hospital day with prescriptions for budesonide, a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin, and a tapering course of oral vancomycin. During the 24 hours after discharge, the patient had four episodes of diarrhea containing bright red blood and returned to the emergency department of this hospital. He reported abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant and fatigue. The temperature was 38.3C, and the abdomen was tender in the right lower quadrant. While the patient was in the emergency department, he had two bowel movements that were loose and melanotic. A stool culture, an assay for Shiga toxin, and examinations for ova and parasites were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Pantoprazole was administered, and a series of hematocrit measurements showed minimal change. By the fourth hospital day, the melena had resolved and the abdominal pain had lessened, although diarrhea persisted. The patient was discharged home on the sixth hospital day. On the day of this admission, the patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital by ambulance because of shortness of breath. He reported progressive fatigue and weakness that had persisted since the most recent hospitalization; on the day of this admission, he had been unable to get out of bed. Medications included aspirin, metoprolol, atorva-statin, cilostazol, budesonide, omeprazole, allo-purinol, sevelamer carbonate, several vitamins, darbepoetin alfa, tramadol, acetaminophen, and vancomycin. Adverse drug reactions included cough with lisinopril, edema with nifedipine, confusion with morphine and oxycodone, and rash with hydrochlorothiazide, felodipine, and clonidine. The patient had emigrated from Southeast Asia 22 years earlier and now lived in an urban area of New England with his wife and daughter. His family history was negative for gastrointestinal, renal, and immunodeficiency diseases. He drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs. On examination, the patient appeared thin and chronically ill. The temperature was 36.7C, the pulse 104 beats per minute, the blood pressure 114/65 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while he was breathing ambient air. Crackles were heard in the posterior lower lung fields on auscultation. The abdomen was mildly tender, and the legs were edematous. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiography revealed changes consistent with mild interstitial pulmonary edema, with small bilateral pleural effusions and a confluent opacity in the left lower lobe. Hemodialysis was performed. The shortness of breath resolved, but weakness and fatigue persisted. The patient was admitted to the hospital. A diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Tuberculous enteritis. ", "prediction": "1.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Jason P. Cooper Medicine: A 71-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent fevers, dyspnea, and hypoxemia, with associated fluctuating pulmonary infiltrates. The patient had reportedly been well until approximately 6 months before this admission, when fatigue, fever, chills, shortness of breath, and erythema in the right leg developed. He was admitted to another hospital. A chest radiograph showed band atelectasis in the left lower lobe. Computed tomography CT of the chest that was performed on the same day revealed multifocal bilateral ground-glass opacities throughout the lungs, consolidation in the lingula and lower lobes, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. A diagnosis of cellulitis of the right leg was reportedly made. Therapy with doxycycline and cefazolin was begun; the patients condition improved, and he was discharged home with a plan to continue a 7-day course of the antibiotic agents. During the next 6 months, multiple episodes occurred that consisted of fatigue and decreased appetite, followed by chills, severe weakness, dyspnea, fevers to a temperature of 39.4C, and hypoxemia. During that time, the patient was admitted at least six additional times to two different hospitals. Multiple CT scans of the chest, the most recent of which had been obtained 6 weeks before this admission, showed improvement of the air-space opacities in the lower lobes but persistence of the upper-zone ground-glass opacities. Antibiotics were administered during the episodes, and symptoms improved within 1 to 4 days; without the administration of glucocorticoids, the patients condition returned to baseline within 8 days. No infectious causes were identified. Bronchoscopic examination with broncho-alveolar lavage BAL was performed 3.5 months before this admission, and the BAL fluid reportedly contained 30 neutrophils, 24 lymphocytes, 32 macrophages, and 2 eosinophils; microbiologic testing and cytologic examination were negative. Results of transthoracic echocardiography were normal, and a videofluo-roscopic swallowing study revealed mild oropharyngeal dysphagia that cleared with spontaneous subsequent swallows. A diagnosis of possible hypersensitivity pneumonitis was made. Approximately 5 weeks before this admission, the patient was discharged from one hospital and admitted on the same day to a third hospital for further evaluation. Blood levels of N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide NT-proBNP and thyrotropin were normal; serum testing for galactomannan, 1,3--d-glucan, and antibodies to strongyloides was negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Blood and urine cultures were sterile. CT of the sinuses revealed moderate opacification in the left maxillary sinus and left infundibular obstruction. On the fourth day, the percentage of eosinophils in the peripheral blood rose to 5.9 reference range, 0 to 5, with an absolute eosinophil count of 320 per cubic millimeter. No ova or parasites were seen in a stool specimen. A diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis was considered. After discharge, the patient moved into a hotel. However, 3 weeks before this admission, fevers and dyspnea recurred and he was readmitted to the third hospital. Testing for antineutro-phil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-PR3 and anti-MPO antibodies, antibodies to double-stranded DNA, and antinuclear antibodies was negative, as were thick and thin blood smears for parasites; blood levels of total tryptase, mature tryptase, IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE were normal. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were sterile, and results of urine cultures were consistent with contamination. The next day, combined positron-emission tomography and CT revealed widespread bilateral ground-glass opacities and associated peribronchiolar consolidation predominantly in the lower lobes; these findings had minimal 18F-fluorodeoxyglu-cose avidity. Bronchoscopic examination with BAL was performed, and the BAL fluid contained 58 macrophages, 18 neutrophils, 10 lymphocytes, 2 monocytes, and 12 eosinophils; the fluid also contained 19 CD4 T lymphocytes reference range, 40 to 58 and 57 CD8 T lymphocytes reference range, 10 to 40, with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 0.33 reference range, 0.56 to 4.27. Polymerase-chain-reaction testing for adenovirus was negative. No organisms or malignant cells were seen, and pathological examination of a transbronchial-biopsy specimen reportedly showed evidence of acute focal lung injury including hyaline membranes, hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, and mild chronic interstitial pneumonitis. Surgical lung biopsy was recommended, and the patient was discharged on the fifth hospital day. Eighteen days later, the patient and his wife came to the outpatient pulmonary clinic of this hospital. He reported the onset of fatigue and shortness of breath beginning earlier that day and suspected another episode was beginning. He reported night sweats, weight loss of 6.4 kg that he attributed to multiple hospitalizations, and no wheezing, cough, chest pain, difficulty swallowing, or known aspiration. He was not aware of any precipitating factors. He had hypertension, dyslipidemia, mild psoriasis, venous stasis, and depression. He lived with his wife and three adult dogs, worked primarily in an office, and reported no known exposure to asbestos, birds, reptiles, or hay. He smoked cigars on rare occasions, previously drank one alcoholic beverage per day until he stopped drinking several months before this presentation, and did not use illicit drugs. He had traveled to coastal Massachusetts 7 months earlier and had no other recent travel. Medications were atorvastatin, ome-prazole, and fluoxetine. He was allergic to cephalosporins which caused a rash and elevated aminotransferase levels. There was no family history of lung or autoimmune disease. On examination, the patient appeared fatigued and was shivering. The temperature was 36.4C, the blood pressure 148/67 mm Hg, the pulse 89 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while he was breathing ambient air and 99 while he was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The height was 193 cm, the weight 104.5 kg, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 28.1. The chest rose symmetrically, without use of accessory muscles or wheezing. Sparse crackles were heard at the right lung base, and 1 leg edema was present, without cyanosis or clubbing. The remainder of the examination was normal. He was referred to the emergency department for admission to this hospital. On examination in the emergency department, the temperature was 38.9C, the blood pressure 155/76 mm Hg, the pulse 104 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. The platelet count, red-cell indexes, plasma anion gap, and results of serum electrophoresis and tests of coagulation and renal and liver function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, ionic calcium, albumin, globulin, lactic acid, troponin T, NT-proBNP, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, vitamin B12, folate, IgG, IgA, and IgM. Other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 102 beats per minute. A chest radiograph showed minor bibasilar patchy opacities, which had improved during the previous 3 weeks. On the second day, CT of the chest, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed improvement in the bilateral ground-glass opacities in the lower lobes. The previously noted consolidation had resolved. Mildly enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes had not changed during the previous 3 months. The next day, a diagnostic procedure was performed. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Recurrent chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. ", "prediction": "1. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: The history of fluctuating pulmonary infiltrates, peripheral eosinophilia, and absence of infection strongly suggests chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis induced by an inhaled allergen.\n\n2. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP): The repeated episodes of bilateral ground-glass opacities and focal lung injury with hyaline membranes and pneumocyte hyperplasia on biopsy are characteristic of COP.\n\n3. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia: The increasing eosinophil count in BAL fluid, recurrent fevers, and pulmonary infiltrates could indicate chronic eosinophilic pneumonia.\n\n4. Connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease: Despite negative serology, an underlying autoimmune process such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic sclerosis could present with such recurrent lung issues and should not be ruled out.\n\n5. Infection-associated acute interstitial pneumonia: Although no pathogens were identified, the presentation resembles an atypical infectious etiology that repeatedly flares and partially resolves with antibiotics.\n\n6. Acute interstitial pneumonia (Hamman-Rich syndrome): The acute onset of symptoms and severe pulmonary impairment aligns with acute interstitial pneumonia, a rare and rapidly progressing form of pneumonia.\n\n7. Drug-induced lung disease: The intermittent symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates could be due to medication side effects, although the patient's medication history does not strongly support this.\n\n8. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Although typically presenting with gradual progression, intermittent exacerbations can occur, causing confusion with other diagnoses.\n\n9. Vasculitis (e.g., Granulomatosis with polyangiitis): Negative ANCA makes this less likely, but the constellation of symptoms and recurrent pulmonary findings warrant consideration.\n\n10. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF): Given the patient's age and chronic medical conditions, intermittent heart failure exacerbations with pulmonary edema could explain the recurring symptoms and radiologic findings, despite normal NT-proBNP levels."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Sarah E. Turbett Medicine: A 29-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of severe dyspnea and chest pain on the right side. The patient, who was a highly trained athlete, had been well until approximately 2.5 weeks before admission, when he was hit in the chest while he was at work; headache and nausea occurred for 3 days thereafter. Approximately 2 weeks before admission, he awoke at night with pain in the right midaxillary region that he described as a ping-pong ball; the pain radiated to and from the right scapula and was associated with shortness of breath. He arose, and after pacing and calming himself, he was able to sleep again. The next day, he went to an urgent care clinic in another city, where a diagnosis of muscle spasm was made. Muscle relaxants and ibuprofen were administered, without improvement. During the following days, increasing dyspnea occurred with minimal exertion; the pain became localized to the right anterior chest and had a sharp, stabbing quality, and a nonproductive cough developed. Three days before admission, during a 1.5-hour flight to Massachusetts, the patient noted having leg cramps, which was a usual occurrence for him on flights. On the morning of admission, he felt well on awakening, but sudden stabbing chest pain in the sternal area later developed, with associated severe pressure in his chest and transient palpitations. While the patient was walking, he noted severe shortness of breath, with increasing tachy-pnea and difficulty talking. Chest pain increased with coughing, laughing, and sneezing. In the evening, the patient went to another hospital for evaluation, where he reported sharp chest pain on the right side that worsened with deep breaths; he rated the pain at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He attributed some of his symptoms to his earlier chest injury. On examination, the patient reportedly appeared to be well. The blood pressure was 138/82 mm Hg, the pulse 89 beats per minute, the temperature 36.8C, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while he was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hema-tocrit, hemoglobin level, red-cell indexes, and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram ECG revealed normal sinus rhythm with a rightward axis. Naproxen and cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride were administered, with some improvement. Dr. Brian B. Ghoshhajra: Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs that were obtained at the other hospital showed a masslike opacity with ill-defined borders posterior to the right hilum, as well as prominent pulmonary arteries Fig. 1A. Contrast-enhanced computed tomographic CT angiography revealed a filling defect in the main and right pulmonary arteries and a mottled, wedge-shaped air-space opacity in the posterior right lower lobe, findings consistent with pulmonary embolism and infarction. However, the embolus was proximally attached to an irregular, enhancing central filling defect that extended into the right ventricle and probably the right atrium. There were signs of right ventricular strain Fig. 1B through 1E. Dr. Turbett: Heparin was administered intravenously. Approximately 4 hours after the patients arrival at the other hospital, he was transferred by ambulance to this hospital for consideration of thrombolysis. On admission to this hospital, the patient reported pleuritic chest pain that had improved since earlier in the day. While he had been taking ibuprofen for the muscle spasms, he noted decreased appetite, with associated weight loss of approximately 1.5 kg. He had had traumatic injury with a cleat to the left calf approximately 3 months before admission; the calf had had minor bruising, without pain or swelling. Sixteen years earlier, the patient had had a Staphylococcus aureus skin infection involving his elbow that required debridement. Otherwise, he was healthy and physically active, regularly participating in semiprofessional sports. He had stopped taking ibuprofen more than 1 week before admission and was taking no other medications. He had no known allergies. He lived in another state with a roommate and worked in education. He drank alcohol occasionally and had never smoked cigarettes or used illicit drugs. He reported no sick contacts or recent hospitalizations. His maternal grandmother had a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, hypertension, strokes, myocardial infarction, and a deep venous thrombosis, and his paternal grandparents had had hypertension. His parents and siblings were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 137/93 mm Hg, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while he was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The carotid arteries had no bruits, and the jugular venous pressure was 5 cm of water, with a normal waveform. The lung sounds were slightly diminished bilaterally, with crackles involving the lower half of the right lung field but no dullness on percussion. The heart rate and rhythm were regular. The left ventricular impulse was discrete and nondis-placed, and there was a right ventricular heave. Auscultation revealed a normal first heart sound S1, a second heart sound with a loud P2 component, a faint low-pitched diastolic sound, and a systolic murmur grade 26 at the base. There was no swelling, palpable mass or cord, erythema, tenderness, or edema in the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, creatine kinase, creatine kinase MB iso-enzymes, troponin T, N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide NT-proBNP, fibrinogen, and total homocysteine were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed trace albumin and was otherwise normal. An ECG revealed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 78 beats per minute, with nonspecific intraven-tricular conduction delay, evidence of right-axis deviation, and no evidence of ischemia. Heparin therapy was continued, and intravenous fluids were administered. During the first hospital day, the blood creatinine level and estimated glomeru-lar filtration rate normalized. On the second hospital day, transthoracic echocardiography was performed. Dr. David M. Dudzinski: Transthoracic echocar-diography Fig. 2; and see Videos 1 through 8, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org revealed a highly mobile irregular mass, nearly 10 cm in length, with a frondlike appearance and heterogeneous echotexture. The mass moved back and forth between the right atrium and the right ventricle, and there was a suggestion of possible attachment near the tri-cuspid valve. The ventricular septal geometry indicated right ventricular pressure and volume overload, and the interatrial septum was stretched leftward. The right ventricle was mildly dilated and mildly hypokinetic in a manner that was suggestive of ventricular strain, but the left ventricle was normal. There was trace tricuspid regurgitation, but the other valves were normal. No mass was seen in the inferior vena cava. The echocardiographic appearance of the mass was not typical of a venous thrombus. Dr. Turbett: Diagnostic procedures were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "An intracardiac mass that is most likely due to a metastatic tumor and associated pulmonary embolism and infarction. ", "prediction": "1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's acute dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, right ventricular strain, and filling defects in the pulmonary arteries on CT angiography are consistent with a pulmonary embolism.\n2. Atrial Myxoma: The highly mobile mass with a frondlike appearance in the right atrium and ventricle seen on echocardiography suggests a possible atrial myxoma, a type of benign heart tumor.\n3. Infective Endocarditis: Given his athletic history and the presence of a mobile cardiac mass, infective endocarditis involving a vegetation near the tricuspid valve is a consideration, though he lacks systemic infection signs.\n4. Cardiac Thrombus: The mass described on echocardiography could represent a cardiac thrombus, particularly in the context of a previous trauma and prolonged sitting during his flight.\n5. Right-sided Heart Failure: The signs of right ventricular strain and dilatation, along with the rightward axis deviation on ECG, point towards possible right-sided heart failure, secondary to a massive pulmonary embolism or other cardiac pathology.\n6. Malignant Neoplasm: Although less common in a young athlete, an intrathoracic malignancy, such as a primary lung cancer or metastatic disease, could explain the mass-like opacity seen on chest radiographs.\n7. Pulmonary Infarction: A consequence of pulmonary embolism, the wedge-shaped air-space opacity on CT imaging is indicative of pulmonary infarction.\n8. Pneumonia: The presence of crackles in the right lung field and the mass-like opacity could suggest an infectious process such as pneumonia, despite the lack of fever and leukocytosis.\n9. Costochondritis: The sharp, stabbing chest pain exacerbated by coughing and deep breathing could also be due to costochondritis, though it doesn't fully explain the other findings.\n10. Pleuritis: The pleuritic nature of the chest pain and history of recent trauma may indicate pleuritis, possibly secondary to a viral infection or the pulmonary embolism itself."}

Herrington Neurology: A 22-year-old right-handed man was admitted to this hospital because of the acute onset of headache and difficulty speaking. The patient had been well until approximately noon on the day of admission, when a dull, diffuse headache developed; the pain gradually increased in severity until he rated it at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He took ibuprofen, and the headache improved but did not resolve. Between 6 and 7 p.m., he smoked marijuana. At approximately 7 p.m., a friend noted that the patient suddenly leaned forward and held his head in his hands. He then stood and was noted to have heavy breathing and unintelligible speech. He appeared to be frustrated by his inability to communicate. His friends brought him to the emergency department of this hospital; he arrived at 7:43 p.m. On arrival, the patient was unable to name the place or date. He reported that he felt confused and had difficulty thinking of and saying words; he rated the headache at 3 out of 10. He reported no recent trauma, neck pain, fever, chills, chest pain, or upper respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. He had sickle cell anemia, which was monitored at another hospital. It was associated with infrequent crises, the most recent of which had occurred more than a year earlier; his most recent blood transfusion had occurred 22 months before this evaluation. He had been hospitalized for pain crises in the past and for the acute chest syndrome once, 6 years earlier. He had had recurrent headaches during the past 15 months; evaluation at another hospital had revealed multiple intracranial aneurysms, which were reportedly stable on serial imaging studies. He had undergone a cholecystec-tomy at 12 years of age. His medications included ibuprofen, as needed for headaches, and folic acid. He had no known allergies. He was a student and lived with a friend. He smoked marijuana regularly, drank alcohol infrequently, and did not smoke tobacco or use other illicit drugs. His parents were of African-American ancestry. His biologic fathers medical history was not known; his mother and two of his three half siblings had the sickle cell trait, his mother and her half brother had had myocardial infarctions and her half brother had also had seizures, a maternal grandmother had hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and a maternal great uncle had reportedly had an aneurysm. There was no known family history of stroke or brain tumors. On examination, the patient was alert and cooperative. The temperature was 36.9C, the blood pressure 108/51 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while he was breathing ambient air. There was conjunctival and sublingual icterus. On neurologic examination, his speech fluency was fair, with occasional paraphasic errors, mild anomia, and circumlocution. Comprehension and repetition of spoken language were almost normal, but he had severe alexia and agraphia. He followed simple commands but confused left and right. He identified individual fingers by name but was unable to perform simple arithmetic, which had previously been easy for him. Perseveration occurred when he attempted to copy alternating geometric shapes. On a test of object recall, he was able to recall none of three objects after 1 minute. On a test of semantic fluency, he was able to name four animals in 1 minute. On a test of phonemic fluency, he was able to name no words that begin with the letter F in 1 minute, and this testing resulted in tachycardia at a rate of 145 beats per minute. He had mild constructional apraxia, but praxis was otherwise intact. Coordination, gait, and cranial-nerve, motor, and sensory functions were normal, as were deep-tendon reflexes; the right plantar reflex was mute, and the left was flexor. He had a score of 3 on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale NIHSS, which ranges from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more severe deficit. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm without ischemic changes and with a J-point elevation in the anterior leads. Urinalysis revealed trace occult blood, with 0 to 2 red cells, 3 to 5 white cells, a few bacteria, and a few squamous cells per high-power field and mucin per low-power field. Screening of the urine for toxins revealed cannabinoids. The ABO blood type was O, Rh positive, with a negative antibody screening. Crystalloid fluids were infused intravenously, and oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. Additional diagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Multifocal infarction in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery due to artery-to-artery thromboembolism resulting from occlusion of the left internal carotid artery; the infarction was related to sickle cell arteriopathy and resulted in alexia, partial Gerstmann syndrome, and cardiac dysautonomia.

Acute ischemic stroke: Given the sudden onset of headache and speech difficulties, along with a history of sickle cell anemia, an acute ischemic stroke is highly likely.\n2. Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Considering his acute severe headache and difficulty speaking, a subarachnoid hemorrhage should be considered, especially with his history of multiple intracranial aneurysms.\n3. Transient ischemic attack (TIA): The rapid onset and subsequent improvement of symptoms could suggest a transient ischemic attack, which is a temporary and reversible stroke-like event.\n4. Complex migraine: His recurrent headaches over the past 15 months and the acute severe headache with neurological symptoms might indicate a complex (or hemiplegic) migraine.\n5. Sickle cell crisis: Although less likely given his neurological symptoms without significant pain, a sickle cell crisis could result in neurological symptoms due to microvascular occlusions.\n6. Drug-induced encephalopathy: The recent use of marijuana might contribute to acute changes in mental status and speech difficulties, raising the possibility of drug-induced encephalopathy.\n7. Central nervous system (CNS) infection: Although he had no fever or chills, the acute onset of neurological symptoms could still suggest a CNS infection such as encephalitis or meningitis.\n8. Intracranial aneurysm rupture: With multiple stable intracranial aneurysms in his history, rupture or leakage of an aneurysm could explain the acute headache and neurological symptoms.\n9. Sepsis: While not presenting with typical signs of an infection, sepsis should be considered as a broader differential for acute confusion and headache, especially in a patient with sickle cell anemia.\n10. Hypertensive encephalopathy: Though his presented blood pressure was within normal limits, episodic hypertensive events might have resulted in acute neurological symptoms and headache."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Katherine L. Tuttle Pediatrics: A 12-year-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of malaise, fevers, abdominal pain, and worsening pallor. The patient had been well until 1 month before admission, when headache and abdominal pain developed. Examination by a school nurse revealed a temperature of 38.6C and pale skin. A diagnosis of a viral illness was made, and follow-up with his pediatrician was recommended. When the patient was reexamined by the nurse 4 days later, the temperature was normal. The skin was pale, the pharynx was slightly erythematous, and the abdomen was tender. At follow-up visits with the school nurse 10 and 6 days before admission, the patient reported persistent upper abdominal pain; the temperature was 38.6C at both visits. On the day of admission, the patient reported headache, nausea, and pain in the right upper abdomen and left leg. The temperature was 37.3C, and the skin appeared to be more pale. He was taken by ambulance to the emergency department of another hospital, where he reported nausea, occasional diarrhea, and abdominal pain. On examination, he appeared mildly ill. The temperature was 37.8C, the blood pressure 92/58 mm Hg, the pulse 123 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while he was breathing ambient air. The height was 132 cm 1st percentile for his age, the weight 26.8 kg 1st percentile; the weight had decreased 1 kg in 1 month, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 15.4 9th percentile. The skin was pale, warm, and dry. The abdomen was soft and non-tender, and there was no hepatosplenomegaly; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of glucose, calcium, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total and direct bilirubin were normal, as were results of renal-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Normal saline, acetaminophen, and oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute were administered; the tachycardia resolved. The patient was transferred by ambulance to this hospital. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported a mild cough, myalgias, fatigue that had been worsening for 1 month, and occasional dizziness during the previous 2 weeks. He also reported nearly constant periumbilical pain that occasionally radiated to the left lower quadrant; he described the pain as squeezing and rated it at up to 7 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He had daily loose stools that were green, with occasional blood mixed in and on the toilet paper, but he had no increased bruising or bleeding when he brushed his teeth. He had been previously healthy and his immunizations were reportedly current, with the exception of a seasonal influenza vaccine. He took no medications and had no known allergies. He had been born in the Caribbean, had come to the United States 4 years earlier, was a student, and lived with his parents and two siblings. He had visited the Dominican Republic, including a rural village, 3 months before admission; he had not taken malaria prophylaxis. He had pet fish and no exposures to animals or sick contacts. There was no family history of sickle cell disease, other hereditary anemia, inflammatory bowel disease, or autoimmune diseases. On examination, the patient was thin and appeared younger than his age. The vital signs and oxygen saturation while he was breathing ambient air were normal. The conjunctiva and oral mucosa were pale. There was no palpable peripheral lymphadenopathy. The abdomen was distended, with mild tenderness on palpation in the right upper and left lower quadrants; there were ecchymoses on the shins, and the remainder of the examination was normal. A stool specimen showed no occult blood. Blood levels of glucose, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and total and direct bilirubin were normal, as were results of renal-function tests. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Katherine Nimkin: A radiograph of the abdomen Fig. 1 showed a moderate amount of fecal matter in the colon and no dilated bowel loops, free air, or skeletal abnormality. Dr. Tuttle: Urinalysis revealed 1 urobilinogen. Blood and stool specimens were sent for culture. Screening of blood specimens for malariaspecific antigens was negative and for cold agglutinins was nonreactive at a dilution of 1:16. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and additional diagnostic tests were performed.

Iron Deficiency Anemia: The patient's pallor, fatigue, tachycardia, and history of gradual weight loss combined with a decrease in hemoglobin levels are consistent with iron deficiency anemia.\n2. Infectious Mononucleosis: The presence of fever, fatigue, sore throat, and abdominal pain can be seen in infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr virus.\n3. Acute Gastroenteritis: The patient's history of green stools and occasional blood suggests an infectious etiology, possibly viral or bacterial gastroenteritis.\n4. Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Chronic abdominal pain, loose stools, and occasional blood in the stool raise suspicion for conditions such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.\n5. Viral Hepatitis: This can present with malaise, fever, abdominal pain, and hepatomegaly; though liver function tests are normal, early-onset hepatitis cannot be ruled out.\n6. Hemolytic Anemia: Pallor, fatigue, jaundice (presence of urobilinogen), and abdominal pain could point to hemolytic anemia despite the absence of an immediate family history.\n7. Celiac Disease: Chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss suggest the possibility of malabsorption due to celiac disease.\n8. Acute Appendicitis: The patient's right upper abdominal pain and systemic symptoms could be due to an atypical presentation of appendicitis.\n9. Parasitic Infection: Given the travel history, infections such as hookworms or giardiasis could explain his symptoms of abdominal pain, malabsorption, and anemia.\n10. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: Persistent fatigue, significant pallor, ecchymoses, and fever could indicate a hematological malignancy like leukemia, though less likely without splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Charumathi Baskaran Pediatrics: An 8-year-old boy was seen in an outpatient clinic of this hospital because of an enlarging mass in the right breast. One week before this presentation, the patient was seen by a pediatrician at another medical facility for a routine annual examination. He had a history of a mass in his right breast that had been present for 18 months and had recently enlarged. On examination, a round, mobile mass was palpable under the right areola. He was referred to the pediatric endocrinology clinic of this hospital. One week later, at the visit to the endocrinology clinic, the patients parents reported that, approximately 18 months earlier, they had noted a mass under the right nipple that was not associated with discharge. The mass had reportedly enlarged in the 6 months before this presentation, and growth of fine pubic hair was also noted. The patient had seasonal allergies and eczema and was otherwise well. He had a history of normal growth and development. His only medication was topical triamcinolone cream for eczema; his childhood vaccinations were current. He had no known allergies to medications. He lived with his parents and younger sibling and was doing well in second grade. His maternal grandfather had asthma, his maternal grandmother had hypercholesterolemia, and his paternal grandmother had breast cancer which had been diagnosed when she was 70 years of age; his parents and younger sibling were healthy. On examination, the patient did not have dysmorphic features. The blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the height 131 cm 68th percentile, the weight 28.4 kg 72nd percentile, and the body-mass index BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 16.5 66th percentile. The abdomen was soft and had some palpable bowel loops. A firm, mobile mass 2 cm by 2 cm was present under the right areola and was not adherent to the skin. A small amount of soft breast tissue was palpable on the left side. Fine, straight, lightly pigmented hairs were present on the lower mons pubis, and on close inspection, very scant fine, light axillary hairs were also present. The testes had an estimated volume of 3 ml; the phallus was prepubertal. The remainder of the examination was normal. Findings on a radiograph of the left hand were consistent with a bone age of 8 years. Eight days after this visit, laboratory tests were performed; the test results are shown in Table 1. Thirteen days after this visit, imaging studies of the chest were performed. Dr. Pallavi Sagar: Ultrasound examination of the right breast Fig. 1 revealed a well-circumscribed, oval-shaped, relatively hypoechoic, mobile mass measuring approximately 1.4 cm by 1.3 cm by 0.8 cm with through-transmission in the retro-areolar region. The mass had smooth peripheral margins and was superficial to the pectoralis muscle; its long axis was parallel to the skin and horizontal in orientation. On color Doppler imaging, the mass was relatively hypovascular and had minimal peripheral-blood flow. The mass did not have irregular spiculated margins, calcifications, or increased vascularity, features that are typically seen in aggressive cancerous lesions. Examination of the contralateral breast revealed a normal left breast bud. Dr. Baskaran: Diagnostic procedures were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Secretory carcinoma of the breast. ", "prediction": "1. Gynecomastia: The presence of a firm, mobile mass under the right areola, along with mild pubertal changes such as fine pubic hair, suggests benign breast tissue proliferation, likely due to hormonal changes.\n2. Puberty-related breast development: The mass and minor pubertal signs in an otherwise healthy 8-year-old could indicate early puberty or pubertal changes.\n3. Lipoma: The well-circumscribed, mobile mass with hypoechoic characteristics on ultrasound is consistent with a benign fatty tumor.\n4. Juvenile fibroadenoma: The hypoechoic, well-circumscribed, mobile mass with smooth margins is characteristic of a benign fibroadenoma, commonly seen in young individuals.\n5. Benign cyst: The description of a well-circumscribed, relatively hypoechoic mass on ultrasound fits the profile of a benign breast cyst.\n6. Rhabdomyosarcoma: Although less likely given the ultrasound features, a firm, mobile mass could also be a presentation of a soft tissue sarcoma.\n7. Mastitis or abscess: The presence of a mass without skin adherence or significant vascularity suggests lower likelihood but still possible infection or inflammation.\n8. Liposarcoma: Although rare in children, a firm, mobile mass could represent a malignant fatty tumor, particularly if there is rapid growth.\n9. Granulomatous disease: The well-circumscribed nature of the mass with minimal vascularity could indicate a granulomatous process, albeit less common.\n10. Metastasis: While extremely unlikely given the patient's age and presentation, metastasis from another primary tumor could present as a breast mass."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Maureen M. Leonard: A 37-year-old woman was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for adult-onset psychosis. The patient had been healthy and studying for a doctoral degree when she began having symptoms of psychosis. Her first symptom was a belief that people were talking about her as part of a larger conspiracy in which family, friends, and random people were part of a game and acting out scenes for her. She had had stress associated with her schooling and had contemplated changing schools. However, she had not had other symptoms of anxiety or depression, neurovegeta-tive symptoms, or auditory or visual hallucinations. A few months later, the patients apartment was burglarized and vandalized; her parents were the only other people with a key, and she believed they were involved. Because of threats she made against family members, she was admitted to an inpatient state psychiatric facility. A diagnosis of psychotic disorder, possibly paranoid schizophrenia, was rendered. An evaluation for causes of the disorder revealed evidence of marked iron-deficiency anemia, including an iron level of 18 g per deciliter 3 mol per liter; reference range, 45 to 182 g per deciliter 8 to 33 mol per liter, a ferritin level of 6 ng per milliliter reference range, 11 to 306, and a transferrin saturation of 3.7 reference range, 11.0 to 50.0. The evaluation also revealed vitamin deficiencies, including a vitamin B12 level of 167 pg per milliliter reference range, 182 to 803 and a vitamin D2 level of 10 ng per milliliter reference value, 32. Before admission to the state psychiatric facility, the patient had had no history of psychiatric disease. She had a remote history of a left-foot fracture and had undergone a right oophorectomy at 17 years of age for torsion of the ovary. She took no medications. Her mother recalled her being a perfectionist, especially during her late teenage years. The patient had reported an unintentional weight loss of 9 kg over an unspecified period of time, despite self-described polyphagia and some hair thinning. She did not have diarrhea. There was no history of head injury or seizure, menopausal symptoms after the oophorectomy, or social withdrawal. Her mother had systemic lupus erythematosus, her sister had hypothyroidism and hyperparathyroidism, her maternal grandfather had diabetes, and an aunt had breast cancer. There was no family history of psychiatric disease. The patient had been previously employed in human resources and had lived alone. She had traveled to the southern United States, coastal Massachusetts, and New York City but not abroad. She followed a pescatarian diet that included dairy foods and an egg daily as part of a lunch salad. She drank one alcoholic beverage per month, did not smoke cigarettes but had used marijuana, and drank two caffeinated beverages daily. After a 1-month inpatient stay at the state psychiatric facility, the patient was discharged. Her medications included risperidone, sertraline, ferrous sulfate, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin C, and a multivitamin. At a routine follow-up visit 6 weeks after discharge, the patient was evaluated by an internist at her primary care physicians office, who found her to be excessively thin. On examination, a thyroid nodule was identified, which prompted consultation with an endocrinologist. A biopsy of the nodule was performed, and examination of the biopsy specimen revealed evidence of Hashimotos thyroiditis and papillary thyroid carcinoma. Radioactive iodine ablation was suggested, but the patient opted for total thyroidectomy. After the thyroid surgery and despite the administration of escalating doses of oral levothyroxine, the patients thyrotropin level reportedly remained high value not available and the free thyroxine level was 0.73 ng per deciliter 9 pmol per liter; reference range, 0.80 to 1.80 ng per deciliter 10 to 23 pmol per liter. Several weeks later, after further dose escalation of levothyroxine, the free thyroxine level was 0.80 ng per deciliter 10 pmol per liter. A limited follow-up examination that was performed by the endocrinologist 6 months after the initial consultation revealed a height of 167.6 cm, a weight of 45 kg, and a body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters of 16.1. The patient was afebrile and had a regular pulse of 75 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg. The thy-roidectomy scar was well-healed, and the remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. However, the patients psychiatric symptoms were believed to be poorly controlled by antipsy-chotic medications, and it was unclear whether her thyroid conditions were related to her psychosis. Diagnostic tests were performed, and the patient presented to this hospital for further evaluation.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Celiac disease in histologic remission. ", "prediction": "1. Hashimoto's thyroiditis: The patient's diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which is associated with psychiatric symptoms including psychosis, could explain her adult-onset psychosis.\n2. Iron-deficiency anemia: Severe iron-deficiency anemia, as evidenced by her markedly low iron and ferritin levels, can lead to cognitive and psychiatric symptoms, including psychosis.\n3. Vitamin B12 deficiency: Vitamin B12 deficiency, present in the patient, can cause neuropsychiatric symptoms such as paranoia and psychosis.\n4. Papillary thyroid carcinoma: Thyroid dysfunction related to her carcinoma and subsequent thyroidectomy could contribute to psychiatric symptoms due to hormonal imbalances.\n5. Paranoid schizophrenia: The patient's symptoms align with paranoid schizophrenia, especially given her beliefs about conspiracies and targeted actions by others.\n6. Autoimmune encephalitis: Given the family history of autoimmune diseases and her psychiatric presentation, autoimmune encephalitis, which can present with psychiatric symptoms, should be considered.\n7. Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE): Considering her mother's history of systemic lupus erythematosus, the patient may have an undiagnosed form of NPSLE presenting primarily with psychiatric symptoms.\n8. Hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis: Thyroid hormone fluctuations, especially after thyroid surgery, can result in psychosis and should be considered as a cause.\n9. Major depressive disorder with psychotic features: The unintentional weight loss, polyphagia, and thinness could indicate a depressive disorder with psychotic features.\n10. Delusional disorder: The specificity of her delusions could suggest a primary delusional disorder separate from schizophrenia, focused on perceived conspiracies and threats."}

The patient had been well until approximately 1 year before admission, when olfactory hallucinations including sulfur and burning odors developed, along with associated nausea. Episodes occurred every few days and lasted for approximately 2 minutes. Approximately 6 weeks before this evaluation, transient daily episodes of numbness and paresthesias on the left side began. Results of a neuro-logic examination performed at another hospital were reportedly normal. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head reportedly revealed a partially enhancing mass in the medial aspect of the right temporal lobe; fluid-attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR images showed extension of the abnormality into the insula and basal ganglia. Levetiracetam was administered for management of suspected focal seizures, and the patient was referred to this hospital for evaluation. The patient was right-handed. He had pain associated with left molar caries for which a root canal was planned and a history of attention deficithyperactivity disorder. He reported no changes in his skin or vision, joint pain, dry mouth, decreased lacrimation, or respiratory symptoms. During childhood, he had had ophthalmologic surgery on his left lens after an injury. Medications included leveti-racetam and dextroamphetamine. He had no known allergies. He lived alone and worked in an office. He drank alcohol in moderation, had smoked cigarettes briefly more than 10 years earlier, and did not use illicit drugs. He was of both African-American and Caribbean ancestry, was born in the United States, and had not traveled to the Caribbean. There was no family history of autoimmune diseases, malignant tumors, or migraine headache. On examination, there were postsurgical changes in the patients left pupil; the right pupil was reactive to light. The remainder of the examination was normal, including examination of the visual fields, strength, coordination, and balance. A complete blood count and urinalysis were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, and glucose and results of coagulation and renal-function tests. An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm and met the voltage criteria for left-ventricular hypertrophy in the precordial leads. A chest radiograph was normal. Dr. George J. Hunter: MRI of the head was performed with and without the administration of contrast material Fig. 1. An irregularly margin-ated and nodular focus of enhancement was present along the medial right temporal lobe, extending into the adjacent tissue of the right cerebral peduncle and abutting the right middle cerebral artery. FLAIR-imaging sequences showed only a moderate amount of abnormal signal in the brain parenchyma adjacent to the enhancing foci. Sagittal and coronal views also showed leptomeningeal nodules of enhancement along the inferior margin of the right basis pontis and, more inferiorly, along the right side of the medulla oblongata. In addition, perfusion imaging and multivoxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy were performed. The results of the spectroscopy were essentially normal, and the perfusion imaging was unhelpful.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Pietro Bortoletto Obstetrics and Gynecology: A 31-year-old primigravid woman was seen in the labor and delivery unit of this hospital at 35 weeks of gestation because of fever. The patient was pregnant with dichorionic, diamniotic twins, and her gestation was complicated by iron-deficiency anemia and hyperemesis. Approximately 3 weeks before this evaluation, mild pruritus of the palms and soles developed. At 32 weeks 5 days of gestation 16 days before this evaluation, the patient was afebrile, had no visible rash, and reported fetal activity; both fetal hearts were heard on auscultation. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A spot urinalysis revealed trace protein. A diagnosis of cholestasis of pregnancy was made, and ursodiol was administered. Four days later, at 33 weeks 2 days of gestation, the patient reported persistent itching, nausea, and occasional vomiting, along with a new pruritic rash on her abdomen that was thought to be consistent with pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy. The results of a biophysical profile that assessed fetal well-being were reassuring. The patient returned home. On the afternoon of the current evaluation, the patient called the obstetrics staff and reported that she had felt crummy during the previous week and had noticed decreased fetal activity that day, with a maximum of four movements in 1 hour, despite hydration. She was advised to come to the labor and delivery triage unit for evaluation. On arrival, she reported nausea, decreased appetite, frequent urination which was unchanged from baseline, subjective fevers, and chills; she did not report bleeding, dysuria, or loss of fluid. She also reported contractions that had occurred during the previous 2 days and had resolved spontaneously. The patients medical history included the presence of the sickle cell trait, gastroesopha-geal reflux disease, and exercise-induced asthma, and she had had dysmenorrhea, a stress fracture of her left tibia, Clostridium difficile infection after clindamycin use, and pancreatitis. Prenatal testing was positive for rubella-specific antibodies and negative for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus surface antigen. Her current medications were ursodiol, iron polysaccharide, a prenatal vitamin, doxylamine for sleep, ranitidine, and an albuterol inhaler. She was black and mar-ried and worked in the medical field. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She did not eat lunch meat or soft cheeses during pregnancy but noted that she consumed well-boiled hot dogs and frequently ate commercial-brand hummus. Her father had had deep venous thromboses; her husband did not carry the sickle-cell trait. On examination, the temperature was 38.1C, the blood pressure 120/71 mm Hg, the pulse 66 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute. The abdomen was soft and nontender. The two fetal heart rates were 140 and 150 beats per minute, with accelerations and moderate variability; no decelerations were noted. On tocodynamometry, uterine contractions were noted to occur every 4 minutes initially, and the frequency decreased to every 8 minutes after intravenous hydration. The platelet count and urinalysis were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. A urine culture was obtained. Acetaminophen was administered, and the infusion of intravenous fluids and fetal monitoring were continued. The fetal heart patterns remained reassuring, and the patient reported increased fetal movement. She was discharged home later that evening and advised to monitor her temperature, to return in 2 days for an evaluation, and to call if symptoms worsened. Induction of labor was scheduled for 5 days after this evaluation. The next morning, the temperature was again 38.1C, and the patient self-administered acetaminophen. She spoke with her obstetrician and was referred to the labor and delivery triage unit. On presentation, she reported feeling tired and ill and having nausea, loose stools, rigors, arthral-gias, and myalgias. On examination, the temperature was 36.7C initially and rose to 38.4C within 30 minutes after her arrival; the blood pressure was 133/71 mm Hg, and the pulse 75 beats per minute. The abdomen was nontender but was noted to be warm to the touch. The cervix was closed and soft, although the uterus was contracting intermittently. The two fetal heart rates were 170 and 180 beats per minute. There was 1 leg edema. The blood levels of lipase, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Specimens of urine and blood were cultured. Rectal and vaginal swabs were obtained to screen for group B streptococcal colonization. Results of bedside ultrasonography confirmed that both fetuses were in the vertex position. Because the patient was thought to have chorioamnionitis, the decision was made to begin the induction of labor. She was admitted to the labor and delivery unit, and ampicillin, gentamicin, and oxytocin were administered. During the course of the induction, cough and pleuritic chest pain developed. A chest radio-graph was obtained. Dr. Thomas W. Keimig: A portable anteroposte-rior chest radiograph Fig. 1 showed low lung volumes and patchy right basilar opacities that were thought to most likely represent atelectasis. Pneumonia could not be ruled out. Dr. Bortoletto: Labor progressed slowly, despite artificial rupture of membranes. Approximately 15 hours after admission, a cesarean section was performed because of a nonreassuring heart-rate pattern in one of the fetuses, and two healthy infants were delivered. The Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes were 8 and 9, respectively, for the first baby and 7 and 8 for the second baby. Diagnostic test results were received.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Listeria monocytogenes bacteremia. ", "prediction": "1.

Scott Harris: A 60-year-old woman was seen in the outpatient pulmonary clinic of this hospital because of increasing dyspnea. The patient had been well until 2 years before the current evaluation, when episodes of mild, nonproductive coughing developed and occurred multiple times daily. Between 13 months and 10 months before the current evaluation, three febrile illnesses occurred, with temperatures up to 38.9C. After the third illness, the patient noted dyspnea with exertion. She was seen by her physician for an outpatient evaluation; a chest radiograph was reportedly normal. Oral azithromy-cin and combined inhaled budesonideformoterol fumarate dihydrate were administered. Sixteen days after the outpatient evaluation, dyspnea worsened and was associated with fevers and chest congestion. On evaluation in the emergency department of another hospital, a chest radiograph reportedly showed pulmonary findings suggestive of possible scarring or consolidation; levofloxacin was administered. Ten days later, computed tomography CT, performed according to a pulmonary emboli protocol, was reportedly negative. An echocardiogram reportedly showed normal left ventricular function and no evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Seven months before this evaluation, results of pulmonary-function tests were thought to be consistent with obstructive lung disease Table 1. The level of 1-antitrypsin was normal. During the next 4 months, the patient noted increased dyspnea while she was climbing stairs and walking fast. Approximately 4.5 months before this evaluation, pulmonary-function tests were repeated Table 1. Additional testing revealed allergies to shellfish, dust mites, oak, and birch. Twenty-seven days before this evaluation, the patient returned to her physicians office because of increasing dyspnea; albuterol by nebulizer and prednisone were administered. One week later, on examination by a pulmonologist at another clinic, the blood pressure was 147/96 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94 while she was breathing ambient air at rest; the remainder of the examination was normal. Thirteen days before this evaluation, pulmonary-function tests were performed. The results are shown in Table 1. Dr. John W. Nance: CT of the chest, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed mild cylindrical bronchiectasis predominantly in the left lower lobe involving the basilar segments of both lower lobes, the right middle lobe, and the inferior lingular segment, with accompanying mild, diffuse bronchial-wall thickening. There was a small focus of atelecta-sis or scarring in the medial segment of the right middle lobe, but the lungs otherwise showed no focal abnormality. There was a small hiatal hernia. Dr. Harris: The patient was referred to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, she reported increasing dyspnea and fatigue with mild exertion during the previous 3 months that had required rest after she walked one block or climbed one flight of stairs, as well as increas-ing frequency of upper-airway tightness and, for 4 days before this presentation, a productive cough with green sputum. She also had had fevers and weight loss of 2.5 kg during the previous month. She had hypothyroidism, hypercholester-olemia, hypertensive disorder, recurrent urinary tract infections, and lichen sclerosus, and she had undergone a total knee replacement. She had smoked one to two packs of cigarettes weekly for 10 years as a young adult. Medications were amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, levothyroxine, montelukast, a multivitamin, and vitamin C orally; albuterol and budesonideformoterol by inhalation; betamethasone dipropionate ointment, clobetasol propionate ointment, and es-tradiol vaginal cream by topical application; cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion; and flutica-sone furoate nasal spray. She had no known allergies to medications. She was married and had two adult children and two dogs. She was a manager in a medical field and reported no known home or occupational exposures. She lived in a suburban area and had traveled to Europe several months earlier. Her mother had Alzheimers disease, her sister had the left ventricular noncompaction syndrome, and her children were healthy. On examination, the temperature was 36.7C, the blood pressure 132/63 mm Hg, the pulse 81 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93 while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 28.9. The lungs were clear, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. The hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, IgA, IgM, IgE, and 1-antitrypsin were normal, as were results of testing for rheu-matoid factor, tests of renal and liver function, and serum protein electrophoresis. Testing was negative for human immunodeficiency virus HIV antibodies and antigen, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ANCA, and antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide CCP, proteinase 3, myeloperoxidase, Scl-70, Jo, Ro, La, Aspergillus fumigatus, A. pullulans, A. flavus, Thermoactinomyces sacchari, T. candidus, T. vulgaris, Micropolyspora faeni, and pigeon sera. Other test results are shown in Table 2. Dr. Nance: CT of the chest was performed Fig. 1, after the intravenous administration of contrast material, according to an interstitial lung disease protocol which includes high-resolution scans obtained during inspiration and expiration and with the patient in the prone position. The scans showed mild cylindrical bronchiectasis predominantly in the lower lobes and mild, diffuse bronchial-wall thickening. There was no difference in the attenuation of the lung parenchyma on expiratory images, as compared with inspiratory images; this finding is suggestive of air trapping. On the expiratory images, there was no lobular or geographic heterogeneity in lung attenuation, a finding indicative of a diffuse process.Dr. Harris: Eight days after the evaluation in the pulmonary clinic, a bronchoscopic examination was performed. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the right middle lobe and lingula revealed clear and colorless fluid, with three nucleated cells per microliter (34% neutrophils, 24% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes, 6% eosinophils, and 32% macrophages or lining cells) and no evidence of pepsin A or galactomannan antigen. Cytologic examination revealed no viral cytopathic changes, fungal elements, or malignant cells. Gram’s staining revealed very few mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, and cultures were negative for bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens. Flow cytometry revealed no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell or unusual T-cell population. During the 11 days after the bronchoscopic examination, increased dyspnea occurred, with associated intermittent low-grade fevers. Test results are shown in Table 2. A chest radiograph showed a patchy right basilar opacity suggestive of atelectasis or aspiration. Albuterol (by nebulizer or by inhaler with a spacer) and a course of azithromycin were administered, and the patient’s condition eventually returned to baseline. Thirty-four days after the evaluation in the pulmonary clinic of this hospital, flexible bronchoscopic examination revealed prominent scarring between the arytenoids, marked inflammation in the subglottic space, scattered whitish secretions with marked airway inflammation throughout the trachea and right and left bronchial trees, and mild ectasia of the central airways. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from the right and left lungs was submitted for microbiologic and cytologic examination and revealed no evidence of viral or bacterial infection. Two days later, a diagnostic procedure was performed. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Obliterative (constrictive) bronchiolitis. ", "prediction": "1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): Given the patient’s history of smoking, chronic cough, and dyspnea with evidence of obstructive lung disease and bronchiectasis on imaging.\n2. Bronchiectasis: Radiographic and CT findings consistent with cylindrical bronchiectasis along with recurring respiratory infections and productive cough.\n3. Interstitial lung disease: Though less likely given the primarily obstructive pattern, the findings of scarring and atelectasis might suggest some interstitial involvement.\n4. Asthma: The presence of reversible airway obstruction on pulmonary function tests, allergies, and relief with bronchodilators could point toward asthma.\n5. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: Potential environmental exposures despite being not well-substantiated in history and some degree of air trapping on CT.\n6. Pulmonary embolism: Despite a prior negative CT for pulmonary emboli, the recurrent nature of her symptoms warrants reconsideration especially given the persistent dyspnea.\n7. Heart failure: Normal echocardiogram makes this less likely, but cardiac causes should still be considered given the patient's significant dyspnea and prior normal cardiac workup might miss early left ventricular dysfunction.\n8. Sarcoidosis: Although testing for autoimmune markers is negative, sarcoidosis can present with miliary lung disease and bronchiectasis.\n9. Infection: Recurrent febrile illnesses and intermittent infiltrates on radiographs could be due to persistent or recurrent infections, viral or atypical bacterial infections could be ongoing despite negative cultures.\n10. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: Even with normal levels, a genetic form not affecting serum levels could potentially account for the COPD-like presentation especially with early-onset dyspnea and lung function decrement."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Kai Saukkonen: A 52-year-old woman was seen in the pulmonary clinic of this hospital for evaluation of a unilateral pleural effusion that had been seen on magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the breasts. The patient had undergone annual MRI of the breasts since she was 39 years of age because of a strong family history of breast cancer: her mother had received a diagnosis of bilateral lobular breast carcinoma at 60 years of age, her maternal grandmother had received a diagnosis of breast cancer at 70 years of age, a maternal cousin had received a diagnosis of breast cancer in her 30s, and the patient had undergone excisional biopsies of the breasts because of breast fibroadenoma at 20 years of age and fibrocystic changes at 33 years of age. Ten years before the current presentation, she had had dyspnea after undergoing an exploratory lapa-rotomy, rectus diastasis repair, and a right ovarian cystectomy for a 3-mm complex right adnexal mass, which was shown on histologic examination to be a hemorrhagic corpus luteum cyst. That symptom of dyspnea was evaluated with the use of electrocardiography and computed tomography CT of the legs and chest for venous thromboembolism; the results of the evaluations were normal. A few months before the current presentation, she had had trauma to the chest wall on the right side during a skiing accident. The patient had no current dyspnea, orthopnea, cough, or wheeze but had an intermittent and self-limited mild sensation of dyspnea and a rapid heart rate after eating to fullness. She had no chest discomfort but had had discomfort in the right side of her back for a few weeks. Otherwise, she had no constitutional, cardiac, rheumatologic, musculoskeletal, or neurologic symptoms. The patients medical history included a cesarean section for arrest of fetal descent and chorioamnionitis, two vaginal births after cesarean section, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia treated with a loop electrosurgical excision procedure, oral herpes simplex virus, supraventricular tachycardia, mild gastroesophageal reflux, a small hiatal hernia with normal endoscopic results, and muscle fasciculations and paresthesia which had been evaluated 11 years earlier by a neurologist and had since been quiescent. She was currently up to date on routine cancer screenings and had had normal colonoscopy results and a normal Papanicolaou smear during the previous 6 months. Medications included valacyclovir, as needed. She had allergies to latex, which caused a skin reaction, and sulfa drugs, which caused a rash. The patient was a lifelong nonsmoker and had never used illicit drugs; she consumed alcohol rarely, on social occasions. She was employed as a physician-scientist, lived with her husband, and had three healthy daughters. Her family owned a farm in New England, where she had previously worked during the summer. She had two dogs at home but no other environmental or chemical exposures. She had traveled to Africa and to China, where she had visited a panda reserve. In addition to the history of breast cancer among her maternal relatives, her father had had prostate cancer, a paternal cousin had had lymphoma, her paternal grandmother had had colon cancer, and multiple maternal and paternal cousins, aunts, and uncles had had esophageal, gastric, renal, lung, and salivary-gland cancers. Furthermore, her mother had osteoporosis and thyroid nodules, her father had a ventriculoperito-neal shunt for normal-pressure hydrocephalus, her paternal grandfather had had Parkinsons disease, one sister had a ventriculoseptal defect that did not require surgery, another sister had a parathyroid cyst, and a third sister had three adenomatous colonic polyps. On examination at the pulmonary clinic, the heart rate was 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 117/56 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while she was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination, including a lung examination, was normal. A basic metabolic profile, a complete blood count, a lipid panel, and results of liver-function tests were normal Table 1. Pulmonary-function testing revealed normal spirometry and diffusion capacity. Previous imaging studies of the chest were reviewed, and additional studies were obtained. Dr. William R. Masch: Review of the patients previous imaging studies Fig. 1 revealed a longstanding history of a right pleural effusion, which had first been noticed on MRI of the breasts that had been performed 14 years before the current presentation. Contrast-enhanced CT of the thorax, performed as part of her evaluation in the pulmonary clinic, revealed a persistent, small right pleural effusion without abnormal pleural thickening, enhancement, or nodularity. There were several subcentimeter pulmonary nodules that had been unchanged for more than 5 years and were thought to represent noncalcified granulo-mas or intraparenchymal lymph nodes. The lungs were otherwise normal and had no evidence of cancer. Dr. Saukkonen: A chest radiograph, obtained with the patient in the right decubitus position, showed trace layering of pleural fluid in the right hemithorax and in the minor fissure. The amount of pleural fluid was insufficient to sample, but serial images showed evidence of stability and cancer screenings were up to date with no evidence of cancer on imaging studies of the chest, and thus the plan was to obtain repeat images of the chest in 8 weeks. During ongoing surveillance of the pleural effusion, uterine bleeding, pelvic fullness, bloating, urinary urgency, and dyspareunia developed. Because of the patients history of an ovarian mass and her concerns about her strong family history of cancer, additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Saukkonen: An endometrial biopsy was performed, and examination of the biopsy specimen revealed a proliferative endometrium and fragments of benign endocervix. An additional diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "The Demons–Meigs syndrome. ", "prediction": "1. Breast cancer metastasis: Given her strong family history of breast cancer and the presence of a longstanding pleural effusion, metastasis from a primary breast cancer is a significant consideration.\n2. Pleural effusion secondary to ovarian cancer: Considering her history of an ovarian mass and recent symptoms of pelvic fullness, pleural effusion could be secondary to metastatic ovarian cancer.\n3. Tuberculous pleuritis: Though less common, tuberculosis can cause a chronic pleural effusion, especially with her travel history to regions where TB is endemic.\n4. Paraneoplastic syndrome: The presence of a pleural effusion and her detailed family history of various cancers could indicate a paraneoplastic process.\n5. Pulmonary embolism: Although previous imaging for venous thromboembolism was normal, chronic microemboli could potentially lead to a localized pleural effusion.\n6. Rheumatologic disease: Conditions like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis can cause pleural effusions, and her intermittent symptoms could fit within this broad category.\n7. Congestive heart failure: Although less likely given her age and lack of cardiac symptoms, it should not be entirely ruled out, especially with episodic dyspnea.\n8. Hepatic hydrothorax: Her history of a small hiatal hernia and intermittent gastrointestinal complaints raise the possibility of hepatic hydrothorax in the context of liver disease.\n9. Post-traumatic effusion: The pleural effusion could be secondary to her recent trauma during a skiing accident, causing a localized reaction.\n10. Pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis: Though the lung parenchyma is normal, this condition can cause pleural effusion particularly in the presence of a history of malignancies in the family."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Daniel Y. Sugai Dermatology: A 65-year-old man with end-stage renal disease was seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of a leg injury and a diffuse pruritic rash. The patient was in poor health, with end-stage renal disease that required hemo-dialysis. Two years before the current presentation, pathological examination of a renal-biopsy specimen revealed advanced global glomerulosclerosis with tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, as well as collapsing focal and segmental glomeru-losclerosis, findings that were superimposed on advanced membranous nephropathy. Six months before the current presentation, evaluation at this hospital revealed severe hypertension, hyperkalemia, and azotemia. Hemodialysis was initiated. Three months before the current presentation, initial evaluation for renal transplantation revealed that the patient had received a diagnosis of secondary syphilis 11 years earlier on the basis of a positive rapid plasma reagin RPR test at a 1:2 dilution and a negative cerebrospinal fluid analysis, for which he received three doses of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine at 1-week intervals; a follow-up RPR test that was performed 4 years before the current presentation was nonreactive. Results of serologic testing for hepatitis A virus and hepatitis B virus were consistent with protective immunity. Testing was negative for hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus HIV types 1 and 2 and positive for human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 HTLV-1; other test results are shown in Table 1. Shortly thereafter, the patient noted a rash on his forearms that he thought was associated with oxycodone, which he was taking for pain associated with the placement of a new hemodialysis fistula. Three weeks before the current presentation, as part of the pretransplantation evaluation, he was seen by an infectious-disease specialist in the outpatient clinic of this hospital. He reported no recent fevers, chills, or weight loss and no history of eczema, psoriasis, or a similar rash. On examination, the vital signs were normal. Nummular circular or oval, scaly, plaquelike lesions were present on the trunk, arms, and legs, and there was bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy; the remainder of the examination was normal. An RPR test was reactive at a 1:1 dilution. Renal transplantation was postponed, pending evaluation by a dermatologist. During the next 3 weeks, the rash became pruritic and progressed, with more extensive involvement of the torso, arms, and legs. Three days before the current presentation, while awaiting dermatologic consultation, the patient fell and injured his right leg and left shoulder. Three days later, he came to the emergency department of this hospital because of pain with weight bearing and leg swelling. The patient had hypertension, a bicuspid aortic valve, and an ascending and aortic-root aneurysm; 13 years before this presentation, he had had a positive tuberculin skin test with a negative chest radiograph. He had had unintentional weight loss of 12 kg during the previous 2 years. His medications were oxycodone with acetaminophen, calcitriol, calcium acetate, clonidine, diltiazem, labetalol, atorvastatin, sertraline, er-gocalciferol, a multivitamin, and, during dialysis, epoetin alfa. He also topically applied an emollient and a 5 lidocaine patch. He had no known drug or food allergies. He was born in Haiti and had moved to the United States 30 years earlier. He was married and retired from work in a medical facility. He had smoked cigarettes for 15 years before stopping 20 years earlier and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. His parents had died in their 80s, and his siblings and children were well. There was no family history of skin cancer or other dermatologic diseases. On examination, the vital signs were normal. The right leg was erythematous, with increased warmth and tense nonpitting edema on the medial proximal leg, point tenderness on the medial leg below the knee, 2 dorsalis pedis pulses, and no findings suggestive of a thrombosed vein. A diffuse rash was present on the torso, arms, and legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. A radiograph of the knee and leg showed no evidence of a fracture or dislocation. Noninvasive vascular studies of the legs revealed no evidence of deep or superficial venous thrombosis. Vancomycin was administered intravenously. The patient was admitted to the observation unit of this hospital. On examination by a dermatologist, the skin type was Fitzpatrick type VI. Large, brown, thin, flat-topped papules were widespread, and many coalesced into polygonal plaques. There was a powdery and occasionally thick scale on the neck, arms, axillae, wrists, dorsal hands, trunk, anterior thighs, legs, and feet Fig. 1. Wrinkling of axillary plaques was present bilaterally. Multiple thin, brown macules and patches with a collarette of scale were present on the palms, and a few were present on the soles. The buttocks and genitalia were spared. A diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Adult T-cell leukemia–lymphoma.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Eric D. Gaier Ophthalmology: A 50-year-old man with psoriatic arthritis and human immunodeficiency virus HIV infection was seen at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary because of cloudy vision. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 3 days before this evaluation, when cloudy vision in both eyes developed gradually over the course of the day. Three days later, he sought medical attention at the emergency department of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. On arrival, he reported fatigue. He also reported that the rash, joint pain, and stiffness associated with his psoriatic arthritis had recently worsened. Sixteen years before this evaluation, the patient had had laser surgery for a retinal tear in the left eye. Ten months before this evaluation, he had had an episode of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia that led to an evaluation for and diagnosis of HIV infection, and he had begun taking antiretroviral medications 2 months before this evaluation. Six weeks before this evaluation, he had been admitted to another hospital because of hypotension, hyponatremia, pancytopenia, and acute kidney injury; the serum alkaline phosphatase level was elevated, the CD4 count and blood cortisol level were low, and blood cultures had no growth. Adrenal insufficiency, disseminated infection with Mycobacterium aviumintracellulare, and the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome were suspected. Antiretroviral medications were stopped, and azithromycin, rifabutin, ethambutol, hydrocorti-sone, and fludrocortisone were administered, as was trimethoprimsulfamethoxa-zole three times weekly. Two weeks before this evaluation, emtricitabine, tenofovir, ritonavir, and darunavir were again initiated. The patient had no known allergies. He lived with his husband, did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs, and drank alcohol socially. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. The pulse was 91 beats per minute, the blood pressure 121/77 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while he was breathing ambient air. Ophthalmologic examination revealed visual acuity of 2025 in the right eye and 2030 in the left eye. The pupils were equally round and reactive to light; there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. The visual fields were full in response to confrontation. Examination of extraocular motility revealed full motility in both eyes. The intraocular pressure was 8 mm Hg in the right eye and 7 mm Hg in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination revealed 1 injection of the conjunctivae, 2 cells in the right anterior chamber, 4 cells in the left anterior chamber, no hypopyon, and diffuse fine and large keratic precipitates on the corneas. Indirect ophthalmos-copy revealed 1 vitreous cells and normal fundi with cup-to-disk ratios of 0.3 bilaterally. The platelet count, red-cell indexes, anion gap, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, glucose, uric acid, total protein, albumin, globulin, alanine amino-transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was discharged home with topical ophthalmic prednisolone for presumed psoriatic arthritis associated iritis. Five days later, the patient was seen at a followup visit, and cloudy vision persisted. The patient also reported that decreased hearing and difficulty balancing had developed synchronously with his ocular symptoms. On examination, visual acuity was 2030 in the right eye and 2040 in the left eye. Anisocoria was present in both bright and dim lighting conditions; there was a subtle relative afferent pupillary defect in the left eye. The intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg in the right eye and 11 mm Hg in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination revealed trace injection of the superior conjunctiva of the left eye, 1 cells in the anterior chambers, posterior synechiae at the 3 oclock position of the right eye, extensive posterior synechiae of the left eye, and diffuse fine and large keratic precipitates on the corneas that were more abundant in the left eye than in the right eye. Indirect ophthalmoscopy revealed normal fundi, 1 vitreous cells in the right eye, and 2 vitreous cells in the left eye. A diffuse rash characterized by erythematous plaques and overlying white scale was present and involved the face, abdomen, back, arms, legs, palms, and soles Fig. 1. Results of serologic testing that had been performed during the emergency department visit 5 days earlier were received. The angiotensin-convertingenzyme level was 80 U per liter reference range, 9 to 67, and the lysozyme level 14.9 g per milliliter reference range, 7.0 to 15.0. Antinuclear antibodies were absent, HLA-B27 was present, and a screening test for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi was positive. Topical ophthalmic prednisolone was continued, and ophthalmic cyclopentolate was prescribed for the presumptive diagnosis of psoriatic arthritisassociated iritis. Eleven days after the initial presentation, the patient was seen by an otolaryngologist because his hearing loss and unsteadiness had worsened. An audiogram revealed moderate sensorineural hearing loss that was worse on the left side than on the right. Later that day, the patient returned to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary because of worsened visual cloudiness and a new floater in the right eye. On examination, the visual acuity was 20100 in the right eye and 20375 in the left eye. Anisocoria was present. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. The intraocular pressure was 8 mm Hg in both eyes. Slit-lamp examination revealed extensive keratic precipitates on the corneas, 4 cells in the right anterior chamber, and 3 cells in the left anterior chamber. Indirect ophthalmoscopy revealed 3 vitreous cells in the right eye with 2 vitreous haze and 4 vitreous cells in the left eye with 4 vitreous haze. There were many small, yellow bilateral inferotemporal preretinal infiltrates. Optical coherence tomography revealed shadowing from vitreous opacities and a normal fo-veal contour in the right eye; in the left eye, there was a poor view of the retina, and an image of the macula could not be obtained. Fluorescein angiography revealed a hazy view of the right eye with staining of the peripheral retina, particularly inferiorly, as well as a very hazy view of the left eye with some leakage and staining of the retina nasally and temporally Fig. 2. A repeat test for B. burgdorferi antibodies was negative. A diagnostic test result was received.

Tuberculosis-Associated Uveitis: The patient’s history of Mycobacterium aviumintracellulare and low CD4 counts requires considering tuberculosis as a cause of uveitis.\n\n5. Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS): Reinitiation of antiretroviral therapy might trigger IRIS, leading to exacerbation of existing ocular inflammation and systemic symptoms.\n\n6. Acute Retinal Necrosis (ARN): This severe retinal inflammation associated with viral infections in immunocompromised individuals can cause rapid visual loss and retinal detachment.\n\n7. Sarcoidosis: Elevated ACE and lysozyme levels, diffuse rash, and bilateral uveitis suggest sarcoidosis, even though the antinuclear antibodies are absent.\n\n8. Psoriatic Arthritis-Associated Iritis: The patient’s worsening symptoms correlated with his known psoriatic arthritis, which can cause uveitis.\n\n9. Lyme Disease: Initially positive antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi and systemic symptoms necessitate considering Lyme disease, despite later negative results.\n\n10. Fungal Endophthalmitis: Given his immunosuppressed state and history of multiple infections, a fungal cause of the uveitis with vitreous involvement should be considered."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Samuel M. Vanderhoek Anesthesia, Critical Care, and Pain Medicine: A 32-year-old incarcerated man was admitted to this hospital after being found in an unresponsive state in his jail cell. Two days before this admission, the patient had had nausea and vomiting. Acetaminophen, at a dose of 650 mg up to three times daily as needed, was prescribed, in addition to a preexisting prescription for acetaminophen at a dose of 325 mg twice daily. Earlier during the day of admission, the patient was reported to be acting strangely; later, he was found in an unresponsive state on the floor of his cell. Emergency medical services personnel were called to the jail, where they found the patient in an unresponsive state, in a decerebrate posture, and incontinent of urine. The blood glucose level, obtained by finger-stick testing, was less than 10 mg per deciliter 0.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter 3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter. The patient was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital. The available medical history was limited. The patient had a history of substance-use disorder including the use of alcohol, opiates, and cocaine, traumatic brain injuries, seizures, anemia, and a psychotic disorder for which the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia had been considered. Six years before the current presentation, tests for human immunodeficiency virus HIV antibodies, hepatitis C virus HCV antibodies, and hepatitis B virus HBV surface antigen were negative, and a test for HBV surface antibodies was positive. The patient had been assaulted several times during the 14 months before this admission; the assaults had resulted in a subdural hematoma, orbital and nasal fractures, and jaw fractures. Eight months before the current admission, he had been admitted to this hospital for altered behavior. On evaluation, he had had an unremarkable computed tomographic CT scan of the head, hyperammonemia that was thought to be related to alcoholism, and an echogenic liver on ultrasonography that was thought to represent a combination of fatty infiltration and fibrosis; his mental status improved with the administration of lactulose. Six weeks before the current admission, the patient had been evaluated at this hospital because of facial injuries. CT scans of the face, brain, and neck were unremarkable; laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Medications included lactulose, thiamine, sertraline, oxycodone, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen. Details of the patients family history were unavailable. The patient had been homeless. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 15 years, had drunk several pints of vodka daily before incarceration, and had previously reported using intranasal cocaine and heroin. On examination in the emergency department, the patient was unresponsive and had grunting respirations. The temperature was 36.9C, the pulse 112 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 1701/19 mm Hg. The skin was jaundiced and the sclerae icteric. The pupils were equal in size; the right pupil reacted to light more slowly than the left pupil. There was diffuse hyperto-nicity, extensor posturing of the arms, myoclonic jerking movements of the legs, and clonus. A systolic flow murmur was heard on auscultation, and the abdomen was mildly distended. Intravenous dextrose and lorazepam were administered on arrival, and endotracheal intubation was performed. A urine toxicology screen was negative. A complete serum toxicology screen revealed no detectable acetaminophen; metabolites of chlordiazepoxide and diazepam were present. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Intravenous thiamine, propofol, N-acetylcysteine, hydrocortisone, vitamin K, and fresh-frozen plasma were administered. Lactulose was administered through an orogastric tube. Imaging studies were performed. Dr. Pamela W. Schaefer: A chest radiograph showed discoid atelectasis at the left lung base Fig. 1A. An abdominal ultrasound image showed a thick, hypoechoic gallbladder wall Fig. 1B, a finding that can be associated with hepatitis. A CT scan of the head, obtained without the administration of contrast material, showed effacement of sulci, a finding consistent with mild brain swelling. There was preservation of gray-white matter differentiation and no evidence of acute ischemia or acute intracranial hemorrhage. Dr. Vanderhoek: The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for additional evaluation and treatment. Dr. Schaefer: Magnetic resonance imaging of the head, performed 22 hours later, revealed swelling of the cortex and thalami; increased signal was seen on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. There was also increased signal in the cortex and thalami on diffusion-weighted images and corresponding decreased signal on apparent diffusion coefficient maps; these findings are consistent with decreased diffusion, which signifies that the edema is cytotoxic Fig. 2. Dr. Vanderhoek: Diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Fulminant liver failure associated with hepatitis B virus infection. ", "prediction": "1. Hypoglycemic encephalopathy: The patient's extremely low blood glucose level (<10 mg/dL) could lead to neuroglycopenia resulting in the unresponsive state, abnormal posturing, and neurological findings.\n2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the history of hyperammonemia, echogenic liver on ultrasound, and jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy secondary to liver dysfunction is a likely cause of altered mental status.\n3. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: The patient’s history of heavy alcohol use and presence of autonomic hyperactivity (elevated pulse, blood pressure) with seizures and altered consciousness suggest severe alcohol withdrawal.\n4. Postictal state: History of seizures may indicate that the patient’s current neurological symptoms are related to a postictal state following a seizure event.\n5. Intracranial hemorrhage: Despite no acute hemorrhage on CT, a prior history of subdural hematoma and recurrent head injuries could result in delayed bleeding or rebleeding causing neurological compromise.\n6. Meningitis/encephalitis: Infectious causes such as bacterial or viral meningitis could present with altered mental status, especially in an immunocompromised or substance-abusing patient.\n7. Drug intoxication or withdrawal: Negative urine toxicology screen does not rule out intoxication/withdrawal from other substances such as benzodiazepines or opioids (metabolites detected), contributing to altered sensorium.\n8. Trauma-related brain injury: Previous assaults leading to traumatic brain injuries could have caused cumulative damage, contributing to current symptoms and the MRI findings of diffuse brain swelling.\n9. Septic encephalopathy: The presence of jaundice, abdominal findings suggestive of hepatitis, and systemic signs such as fever, tachycardia, and hypertension can indicate sepsis leading to encephalopathy.\n10. Wernicke’s encephalopathy: Chronic alcohol use with a history of thiamine deficiency makes this condition a plausible diagnosis, characterized by confusion, ataxia, and ocular abnormalities."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. David K. Rhee Cardiology: A 65-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of syncope, dyspnea, and leg edema. The patient had been in his usual health until approximately 1 month before admission, when cough occurred. One week later, his legs became swollen and weeping sores developed. Dyspnea on exertion without orthopnea developed and was associated with a weight gain of 7 kg. The patient was seen by his primary care physician at another hospital. On examination, a new cardiac murmur was heard. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Therapy with furosemide and lisinopril was begun, and echocardiography and chest imaging studies were scheduled. Four days before this admission, contrast-enhanced computed tomography CT of the chest, performed at another hospital, revealed diffuse bulky lymphade-nopathy throughout the mediastinum and both hilar regions, fine reticular lung markings, evidence of previous granulomatous disease in the right middle lobe, an enlarged heart, a thyroid nodule, and ill-defined enlargement of the left adrenal gland. On the morning of admission, while the patient was boarding a plane for an early flight, light-headedness suddenly developed. Shortly thereafter, he lost consciousness and fell to the aisle on his left side; he had no head trauma. His wife estimated that he was unconscious, with open eyes and jerking movements, for approximately 10 minutes. After regaining consciousness, he reported no chest pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, urinary or fecal incontinence, or confusion. He was brought to this hospital by emergency medical services personnel. The patient had not eaten that morning. He had had hypertension for approximately 3 years. Medications included carvedilol, lisinopril, furosemide, and aspirin. He had no known allergies. He was married and traveled frequently for work. He drank alcohol in moderation and did not use illicit drugs; he had a history of cigarette smoking of 50 pack-years but had stopped 5 years earlier, and he smoked cigars occasionally. His sister had Crohns disease, but there was no family history of cardiac disease, arrhythmia, or sudden death. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented and appeared chronically ill, with bitemporal wasting. The blood pressure was 113/61 mm Hg, the pulse 53 beats per minute, the temperature 36.3C, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94 while he was breathing ambient air. The mucous membranes were dry. Prominent submandibular lymphadenopathy was present. The jugular venous pressure was 15 cm of water, and C-V waves systolic pulsations were observed. There were diffuse crackles at the lung bases. The rhythm was slow and regular, with an augmented second heart sound, a midpeaking systolic ejection murmur grade 36 that was loudest at the base, a holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternum grade 36 that increased in magnitude with inspiration, and an apical holo-systolic murmur grade 36. A right ventricular heave and a pulsatile liver were present. Prominent inguinal lymphadenopathy was present, along with 3 pitting edema in both legs; there was no calf tenderness, but multiple healing ulcerations were present on the lower legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. The results of electrocardiography were interpreted as normal, except for evidence of probable left ventricular hypertrophy. The hematocrit, hemoglobin, red-cell indexes, platelet count, and lipid profile were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, uric acid, troponin T, and glycated hemoglobin; other test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Suhny Abbara: A chest radiograph showed a prominent right hilum with a lobulated contour, extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopa-thy, and prominent interstitial markings and reticular opacities with thickening of the fissures, findings suggestive of pulmonary edema Fig. 1. An increased cardiothoracic ratio was indicative of cardiomegaly. CT of the chest, performed according to the pulmonary-embolism protocol, did not reveal filling defects in the pulmonary arteries, and therefore pulmonary embolism was an unlikely diagnosis Fig. 1. Multiple densely calcified pulmonary nodules were present in both lower lobes and along the right minor fissure; these findings were consistent with previous granu-lomatous disease. Persistent bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy was also present. The pulmonary artery was enlarged at 3.5 cm, a finding consistent with pulmonary hypertension possibly due to back pressure resulting from congestion on the left side. The left ventricle and left atrium were enlarged. Coronary atherosclerotic calcifications and mitral annular and aortic calcifications were present, along with flowing anterior osteophytes at multiple levels of the thoracic spine that were consistent with DISH diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis; there were no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions. Although the CT scan was not electrocardiogram-gated, the basal ventricular septum appeared hypertrophied relative to the adjacent myocardium. There was a suggestion of systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral-valve leaflet in an axial slice that appeared to be acquired during systole Fig. 1. Dr. Rhee: During the next 3 days, testing for myocardial infarction and a skin test for tuberculosis were negative. Carvedilol therapy was stopped because of bradycardia with pauses longer than 3 seconds, but the patient was noted to have nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on telemetry. Lisinopril was administered once and then switched to captopril. Echocardiography was performed. Dr. Gary S. Mak: A transthoracic echocardio-gram showed asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with upper septal predominance thickness of the septum, 24 mm; thickness of the posterior wall, 16 mm; normal thickness for both, 11 mm, a finding consistent with hyper-trophic cardiomyopathy. The left ventricle was hyperkinetic, with an ejection fraction of 81 and near obliteration of the midventricular and apical cavity. There was systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral-valve leaflet, and a left ventricular outflow tract gradient was estimated to be more than 100 mm Hg at rest; both findings are consistent with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy Fig. 2. Extensive mitral annular calcification encroached on the posterior mitral-valve leaflet, and this resulted in moderate mitral-valve stenosis with a peak transmitral gradient of 21 mm Hg and a mean gradient of 8 mm Hg. There was a flail portion of the posterior mitral-valve leaflet, with severe mitral regurgitation and a dilated left atrium. No obvious valvular vegetations were present. There was severe tricuspid regurgitation and severe pulmonary hypertension, with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 122 mm Hg and inter-ventricular septal compression; the right ventricle was mildly dilated and hypokinetic. On the fourth day, a transesophageal echo-cardiogram again showed marked asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral-valve leaflet. The tip of the middle scallop of the posterior mitral-valve leaflet was flail, with an associated chordal remnant. There was severe mitral regurgitation with an eccentrically directed jet, severe tricus-pid regurgitation, and right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction. Fig. 2 Dr. Rhee: On the fifth day, flow cytometry of the peripheral blood showed no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell or unusual T-cell population. Testing for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus HIV and blood cultures were negative. The next day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Sarcoidosis involving the heart and thoracic and inguinal lymph nodes. ", "prediction": "1. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: The patient shows signs of asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and a high left ventricular outflow tract gradient, consistent with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.\n2. Congestive heart failure: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, edema, cardiomegaly, and weight gain along with echocardiographic findings suggest severe heart failure.\n3. Pulmonary hypertension: The CT and echocardiogram show severe pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction, likely secondary to left heart disease.\n4. Severe mitral regurgitation: Echocardiographic findings reveal a flail posterior mitral-valve leaflet with severe mitral regurgitation and an eccentrically directed jet.\n5. Tricuspid regurgitation: There is evidence of severe tricuspid regurgitation seen on echocardiography, confirmed by elevated right ventricular systolic pressure and symptoms.\n6. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy: Diffuse bulky lymphadenopathy is consistent with either a malignant process such as lymphoma or a reactive process like sarcoidosis.\n7. Thyroid nodule: The presence of a thyroid nodule may indicate thyroid dysfunction or possibly a neoplastic process, both of which can affect overall health.\n8. Adrenal gland enlargement: The ill-defined enlargement of the left adrenal gland could suggest an adrenal mass which might be an adenoma or malignancy.\n9. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): Given the history of heavy smoking and the presence of pulmonary nodules consistent with prior granulomatous disease, COPD is a consideration.\n10. Cardiac amyloidosis: The patient's restrictive ventricular filling pattern and hypertrophic appearance of the heart suggest possible amyloid deposition."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Nathan L. Scott Medicine: A 46-year-old man with myxoid chondrosarcoma of the left femur was evaluated by the internal medicine consult service because he had worsening somnolence 1 day after he underwent proximal femoral replacement surgery. The patient had been well until 5 weeks before this evaluation, when he slipped and fell onto the pavement during a vacation in Haiti. Left hip pain developed immediately, and he had difficulty getting up after the fall. The patient rested and took ibuprofen, but the pain did not decrease. Two weeks later, after returning to the United States, the patient went to the emergency department of another hospital and reported that the pain had progressively increased and that he was unable to bear weight on the left leg. He had been previously healthy, was taking no medications, and had no known allergies. He lived in an urban area of New England with his girlfriend, drove a bus, and did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He was born in Haiti and had returned there frequently after moving to New England during childhood. His father had hypertension and diabetes mellitus; there was no known family history of bone or soft-tissue cancer or of venous thromboembolism. On examination, the blood pressure was 154/99 mm Hg, and the other vital signs were normal. There was tenderness over the greater trochanter of the left femur, and the pain increased with rotation of the left hip. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: A frontal radiograph showed a lytic lesion, measuring 4.8 cm by 3.9 cm, involving the left femoral neck and greater trochanter, with cortical thinning Fig. 1. A region of cortical discontinuity raised concerns about cortical breakthrough or a pathologic fracture. Dr. Scott: The patient was admitted to the other hospital, and ibuprofen, oxycodone, enoxaparin, amlodipine, docusate, and senna were administered. On the fourth hospital day, the patient was discharged home and advised to follow up with an orthopedic surgeon at this hospital. The patient was seen in the orthopedic surgery clinic 3 weeks after he had fallen. He reported that the pain had decreased but continued to be present during ambula-tion and when he slept on his left side. On examination, there was tenderness in response to deep palpation over the greater trochanter of the left femur. A computed tomography CTguided core-needle biopsy of the lytic bone lesion was performed; histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed myxoid chondrosarcoma. Four weeks after the patient had fallen, he returned to the orthopedic surgery clinic and reported that the pain persisted but had decreased in severity. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A CT scan of the chest, obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed no evidence of thoracic metastases. Surgical resection of the femoral tumor was scheduled for the following week. The day before this evaluation, the patient underwent proximal femoral replacement surgery; the left proximal femur was resected, and the hip was reconstructed with the use of a cementless bipolar endoprosthetic implant. The procedure was complicated by a posteriorly oriented crack in the femur that occurred during implantation of the prosthesis. Dr. Vikram Deshpande: The resection specimen showed myxoid chondrosarcoma grade 23. On macroscopic examination, the tumor measured 3.5 cm by 3.0 cm by 2.5 cm and involved the neck and greater trochanter of the femur Fig. 2A. The tumor infiltrated adjacent cortical and cancellous bone Fig. 2B and was composed of mononucle-ate and binucleate cells embedded in abundant myxoid stroma Fig. 2C. On immunohistochemi-cal staining for S100, the tumor cells were diffusely and strongly positive; this nonspecific stain is positive in virtually all cartilaginous cancers, including chondroblastic osteosarcoma. The tumor was accompanied by a fracture callus Fig. 2D. There was no evidence of vascular invasion, and all resected margins were negative for tumor. Dr. Scott: After completion of the surgery, the patient was transferred to the postanesthesia care unit, where he was initially sleepy but arousable; within 2 hours, he was alert and oriented to person, place, and time, as well as responding appropriately to questions and using patient-controlled analgesia with a morphine infusion pump. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Postoperative radiographs of the left hip and femur showed a nondisplaced fracture of the distal femoral diaphysis extending from the distal tip of the femoral implant to the distal femoral me-taphysis. The patient was transferred to the inpatient unit. The next morning, 12 hours after the conclusion of surgery, the patient reported that his pain was well controlled. Two hours later, he was noted to be drowsier and less interactive. He neither spoke spontaneously nor responded verbally to questions, and he opened his eyes only intermittently when he was spoken to by caregivers. Tachycardia developed; the pulse was 110 beats per minute. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Magnesium sulfate was administered. Sixteen hours after the conclusion of surgery, use of the morphine infusion pump was discontinued. The patient became increasingly somnolent. Two hours later, naloxone was administered; there was a mild, transient increase in eye opening and an increase in heart rate to 137 beats per minute, and hypertension developed, with a blood pressure of 2021/07 mm Hg. Metoprolol was administered; the pulse decreased to 106 beats per minute, and the blood pressure to 143/83 mm Hg. The temperature was 38.9C. Laboratory test results obtained 24 hours after the conclusion of surgery are shown in Table 1. Dr. Gonzalez: CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial infarction, or intracranial mass lesion. Dr. Scott: Medical consultation was requested for persistent somnolence. On evaluation by the consulting physician, the patient was unable to answer any questions. Medications included enoxa-parin, amlodipine, a multivitamin, and intravenous fluids. On examination, the temperature was 37.7C, the pulse 121 beats per minute, the blood pressure 135/89 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation between 95 and 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was somnolent but opened his eyes in response to loud verbal stimuli and intermittently executed simple actions, including wiggling his toes and squeezing the examiners hand, after being repeatedly instructed to do so. The patient responded to trapezius pinching by grimacing symmetrically, and he strongly withdrew from painful stimulation of the hands and the right foot. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light, constricting from 3 mm to 2 mm. There was mild nuchal rigidity, and Kernigs sign was present. Examination of the heart revealed persistent tachycardia and was otherwise normal. The incision in the left leg was well approximated and had no surrounding erythema; there was no crepitus on palpation of the soft tissues around the incision. The remainder of the examination was normal. Urinalysis showed 1 occult blood, 1 leukocyte esterase, a specific gravity of 1.017, and a pH of 5.0; there were 3 to 5 red cells per high-power field, 10 to 20 white cells per high-power field, and 5 to 10 hyaline casts per low-power field. A serum toxicology screen was negative; a urine toxicology screen was positive for opiates and benzodiazepines. Specimens of urine and blood were obtained for culture. The patient was transferred to the medicine service for additional evaluation and treatment. On examination 27 hours after the conclusion of surgery, the temperature was 36.7C, the heart rate 140 beats per minute, the blood pressure 113/86 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while he was breathing ambient air. The patient opened his eyes in response to voice and painful stimuli; he did not follow commands. The gaze was slightly deviated to the upper right, and there were occasional roving eye movements. There was mild rigidity of the arms, and the right patellar deep tendon reflex was 3. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Additional studies were performed, and a diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Somnolence due to the cerebral fat embolism syndrome.

Thirty-five hours before admission, the patient was seen in an outpatient clinic affiliated with this hospital for evaluation of multiple problems, including a 3-week history of mild pain in the shoulder and left side of the neck, a 2-month history of muscle pain in the left leg that had occurred after a sports injury, listlessness, and a 3-month history of increasing frequency of urination, which occurred in small amounts up to twice each night and every 3 hours during the day and for which he had begun to restrict fluid. His neck pain had developed at work. Examination of the neck had revealed trapezius muscle spasm; naproxen, acetaminophen, and cyclobenzaprine had been administered, and the pain partially decreased. He also had a history of hypertension, benign prostatic hypertrophy, diverticulitis, lumbar disk disease, colonic polyps, ischial bursitis, chronic dyspepsia, nocturnal leg cramps, excessive alcohol use, and osteoarthritis of the shoulders, knees, and hips. Medications were amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, calcium carbonate for dyspepsia, tamsulosin, n3 fatty acids, glucosamine, and a multivitamin, as well as ibuprofen and naproxen for musculoskeletal symptoms and, as needed, tadalafil and disulfiram. He had no known medication allergies. On examination, the patient appeared to be comfortable. The temperature was 36.7C, the blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg, the pulse 108 beats per minute, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 31.2. The posterior neck and occipital region on the left side were tender but had full range of motion, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The platelet count, red-cell indexes, and blood levels of glucose, thyrotropin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Examination of the urine revealed turbid yellow fluid that was otherwise normal; urine culture was negative. That evening, after results of the blood tests were known, the patient was contacted and asked to return the next day for additional testing. Approximately 26 hours after the initial laboratory tests, the additional testing was performed. The blood levels of glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, total bilirubin, lactate dehydroge-nase, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotrans-ferase, and aspartate aminotransferase were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Eight hours later, when the test results were known, the patient was advised to go to the emergency department of this hospital for evalu-ation of potentially life-threatening abnormalities, and he was subsequently admitted. In the emergency department, the patient reported residual stiffness of the neck. He had had an influenza-like illness with subjective fevers, diaphoresis, and nasal congestion approximately 3 weeks before this evaluation that resolved spontaneously, and he reported chronic constipation that was unchanged. He had stopped drinking alcohol 4 years earlier and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. He lived with his wife, had adult children, and worked in an office. His father and a grandfather had died of lung cancer, a grandmother had died of a stroke, his mother had died of liver disease, and an uncle had had pancreatic cancer. On examination, the temperature was 36.8C, the blood pressure 1591/14 mm Hg, the pulse 109 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a ventricular rate of 101 beats per minute, a PR interval of 260 msec, a QRS complex of 136 msec, and a ratio of QT interval to QT interval corrected for heart rate of 318:412 msec; first-degree atrioventricular block and right bundle-branch block were present and had not been present 3 years earlier. A chest radiograph showed clear lungs and degenerative changes of the spine. The platelet count, prothrombin time, and prothrombin-time international normalized ratio were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, phosphorus, lactic acid, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bili-rubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine amino-transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lipase, troponin T, and N-terminal proB-type natri-uretic peptide; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed yellow, slightly cloudy urine, with a pH of 9.0, a specific gravity of 1.006, and 1 occult blood by dipstick, as well as 0 to 2 red cells and 3 to 5 white cells per high-power field; squamous cells were present. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. William E. Palmer: Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous or oral contrast material, revealed no evidence of cancer. CT of the chest revealed an indeterminate sclerotic lesion involving the right eighth rib Fig. 1. A radionuclide bone scan was recommended as a screening study for additional skeletal lesions. The bone scan revealed nonspecific abnormal uptake by the rib lesion and at the left ischium Fig. 2. Because there were concerns about cancer, magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the pelvis was recommended for further evaluation and revealed a high-grade tear of the left common hamstring tendon at the ischial tuberosity attachment site. A fluoroscopically guided glucocorticoid injection had been performed at this location 11 months earlier. Dr. Gupta: Additional tests were performed, and a diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "The milk alkali syndrome. ", "prediction": "1. Primary hyperparathyroidism: The patient's hypercalcemia and malaise are consistent with hyperparathyroidism, which could be caused by a parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia.\n2. Malignancy-associated hypercalcemia: His family history of various cancers and unexplained rib lesion raise the suspicion of a malignancy such as multiple myeloma or metastatic bone disease.\n3. Multiple myeloma: Considering the sclerotic rib lesion, elevated calcium, and symptoms of weakness and fatigue, multiple myeloma should be evaluated.\n4. Vitamin D intoxication: Excessive intake of calcium carbonate and multivitamins containing vitamin D could lead to hypercalcemia.\n5. Sarcoidosis: This granulomatous disease can cause hypercalcemia and could be a differential, especially with a history of unexplained symptoms and clear lungs.\n6. Milk-alkali syndrome: Chronic ingestion of calcium carbonate for dyspepsia may indicate this syndrome, marked by hypercalcemia and renal impairment.\n7. Hyperthyroidism: Though less likely with normal thyrotropin levels, hyperthyroidism can cause hypercalcemia and unexplained muscle weakness.\n8. Adrenal insufficiency: This condition might present with hypercalcemia and generalized weakness, though other signs and symptoms are needed for confirmation.\n9. Acute renal failure: While no direct renal impairment is noted, dehydration and use of diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide) can cause hypercalcemia and kidney issues.\n10. Immobilization: His history of musculoskeletal issues, particularly recent hamstring tear, can lead to increased bone resorption and hypercalcemia due to prolonged immobility."}

Goldstein Medicine: A 33-year-old man was seen in the surgery clinic of this hospital because of painful bowel movements and rectal bleeding. The patient had been well until approximately 4 months before this presentation, when pain with defecation developed. He typically had one bowel movement each day and noted bright red blood on the toilet paper after wiping, although blood did not appear to be mixed in with the stool itself. The patient had not had abdominal pain or weight loss. On the sixth day of illness, he was seen by his primary care physician. The patient reported that he had had a sexual encounter with a man approximately 6 weeks earlier. On examination, a tender external hemorrhoid was noted; the vital signs and the remainder of the examination were normal. Tests were negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and antibodies to hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and the human immunodeficiency virus HIV. Psyllium, naproxen, and topical hydrocortisone cream were prescribed. Approximately 10 weeks later, the patient returned to the primary care clinic and reported that rectal pain and bleeding with defecation had persisted. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 36.4C, the pulse 82 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 126/76 mm Hg. Bleeding hemorrhoids were noted around the anal opening; the remainder of the examination was normal. Psyllium, naproxen, and topical hydrocortisone cream were continued, and the patient was referred to the colorectal surgery clinic at this hospital. At the surgery clinic, the patient reported that the rectal pain and bleeding persisted and that he had not noted any protrusion of tissue through the anus. His medications included naproxen, as needed, and hydrocortisone cream applied topically to the anus, which had provided only minimal pain relief. He had no known allergies. He had emigrated from Brazil 16 years earlier and now lived with his wife in an urban area of New England. He worked in construction and did not smoke tobacco. He was bisexual; he reported that he had never had a sexually transmitted infection. His mother had hypertension. There was no family history of colorectal cancer. The patient appeared well. Examination of the neck, heart, lungs, and abdomen was normal. At the anterior and posterior mid-line anal verge, there were large, superficial anal fissures and small-to-moderate-sized distal sentinel skin tags. Results of a digital rectal examination were normal except for the presence of moderate tenderness. Anoscopy revealed the fissures and small internal hemorrhoids. Flexible sigmoid-oscopy was performed, with insertion of the sigmoidoscope to a depth of 30 cm; mild-to-moderate mucosal inflammation of the most distal 10 cm of the rectum was present and was characterized by edema and patchy erythema. A diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Syphilitic proctitis. ", "prediction": "1. Anal fissures: The patient's symptoms of painful bowel movements and bright red blood on toilet paper are classic signs of anal fissures, confirmed by physical examination.\n2. Hemorrhoids: The presence of small internal hemorrhoids and tender external hemorrhoid noted on examination can cause rectal bleeding and anal pain.\n3. Proctitis: The mild-to-moderate mucosal inflammation at the distal rectum observed in sigmoidoscopy suggests proctitis, which can cause bleeding and discomfort.\n4. Sexually transmitted infection (STI): The patient's history of a sexual encounter with a man raises the possibility of STIs like herpes or chlamydia, which might present with rectal pain and bleeding.\n5. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): Although less likely due to the localized nature of inflammation, conditions like ulcerative colitis can cause rectal bleeding and mucosal inflammation.\n6. Rectal ulcers: Persistent pain and bleeding along with mucosal inflammation could indicate rectal ulcers, possibly secondary to other primary conditions like IBD.\n7. Colorectal cancer: While there's no family history and the patient is relatively young, rectal bleeding should still prompt consideration of colorectal cancer, though this appears less likely given the clinical context.\n8. Fissure-associated skin tags (sentinel piles): The presence of distal sentinel skin tags is commonly associated with chronic anal fissures and could contribute to pain and bleeding.\n9. Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome: Chronic straining and rectal pain along with noted mucosal changes might indicate this condition, though it's less common.\n10. Ischemic colitis: Although less likely given the presentation and patient's age, ischemic colitis can cause rectal bleeding and mucosal inflammation."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Danielle M. Panelli Obstetrics and Gynecology: A 71-year-old woman with mul-lerian carcinoma was evaluated at this hospital during the fall because of fever, fatigue, and myalgias. The patient had been well until 1 year before this evaluation, when explosive diarrhea developed. Examination of biopsy specimens obtained during flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy revealed evidence of microscopic colitis. Predni-sone was administered, and the diarrhea resolved; after the prednisone therapy was tapered and then stopped, diarrhea recurred. Budesonide was prescribed. Three months before this evaluation, the patient was seen at a local gastroen-terology clinic. She had abdominal bloating and reported that reducing the dose of budesonide had been associated with recurrent diarrhea. She was following a lactose-free, gluten-free diet. On examination, the abdomen was distended and soft and had no masses. Budesonide was continued, and discontinuation of daily aspirin was recommended. Six weeks later and 6.5 weeks before this evaluation, the patient was seen by her primary care physician because of increased abdominal bloating, which was reported to be worse late in the day. She also reported that sexual intercourse had been difficult that week because her vagina seemed shorter. On examination, the abdomen was distended, with mild diffuse tenderness and slightly hyperactive bowel sounds. Results of a bimanual pelvic examination were normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anion gap, blood level of total bilirubin, and results of renal-function tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Four days later, imaging studies of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained. Dr. Kathryn P. Lowry: Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed moderate ascites Fig. 1A and extensive peritoneal nodularity with omental caking Fig. 1B, findings consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis. The ovaries were normal in size, and the uterus appeared enlarged Fig. 1C. Dr. Panelli: Seven days later and 5 weeks before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the gynecologic oncology clinic at another hospital. Results of coagulation tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Ultrasound-guided paracentesis was performed, and cytologic examination of an aspirate of peritoneal fluid revealed adenocarcinoma, a finding that is most consistent with high-grade serous carcinoma of a gynecologic origin. One week later and 4 weeks before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the gynecologic oncology surgery clinic at this hospital. She had a history of colitis, hypertension, type 1 second-degree atrioventricular block, the sick sinus syndrome, Sjogrens syndrome, Raynauds phenomenon, atopy, chronic upper-airway cough syndrome, osteopenia, vitamin B12 deficiency, and glaucoma and had undergone laparoscopy with salpingec-tomy for an ectopic pregnancy. Medications included oral budesonide, diltiazem, cetirizine, and probiotics and intramuscular cyanocobalamin. She had allergies to tetracyclines, sulfamethoxa-zole, and latex; atorvastatin had caused elevated serum aminotransferase levels. The patient lived with her husband in a rural area of New England; she typically traveled to coastal New England during the summer but had not done so during the preceding year. She did not have pets. There was no family history of cancer. On examination, the temperature was 37.3C, the pulse 99 beats per minute, the blood pressure 169/91 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 49.3 kg. The abdomen was distended, and a fluid wave was present. The vaginal mucosa was atrophic, the uterus was anteverted and mobile, and there were no cul-de-sac nodularities or adnexal masses. The anion gap and results of coagulation and renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of magnesium, globulin, and total bilirubin; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Three days later and 3.5 weeks before this evaluation, the patient underwent surgical exploration and cytoreduction for a presumptive diagnosis of mullerian adenocarcinoma. Clindamycin and gentamicin were administered preoperatively; phenylephrine, insulin, calcium chloride, fentanyl, hydromorphone, lactated Ringers solution, albumin, and 3 units of packed red cells were admin-istered during the procedure. Operative findings included approximately 2 liters of straw-colored ascitic fluid, tumor nodules in the splenic hilum and parenchyma and studding the right hemi-diaphragm, replacement of the gastrocolic omen-tum by tumor, and obliteration of the cul-de-sac by a large pelvic mass invading and partially obstructing the rectosigmoid colon. Gastrocolic omentectomy, splenectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, resections of the pelvic mass and rectosigmoid colon with primary reanastomosis, and plasma energy vaporization of tumor nodules on the right hemidiaphragm were performed. Resection specimens were submitted for histopathological examination. Dr. Kristen M. Basnet: The primary resection specimen consisted of a 15.2-cm aggregate of large bowel, uterus, and adnexal structures that were firmly adherent one to another and contained a 15.0-cm irregular, firm, tan-white mass Fig. 2A. The cervix, the spleen, and portions of the omentum were submitted separately for examination. Microscopic examination revealed high-grade carcinoma in the ovaries, invading the muscularis propria of the large bowel Fig. 2B, and adjacent to the fallopian tubes Fig. 2C. The tumor was also seen adjacent to the uterine se-rosa and in the omentum, spleen, and mesentery of the transverse colon. The tumor was composed of nests and cords of pleomorphic cells with high mitotic activity Fig. 2D and had slit-like spaces and psammomatous calcifications Fig. 2E. On immunohistochemical staining, the tumor cells were positive for PAX8 Fig. 2F and negative for p53. The findings were consistent with high-grade carcinoma of mullerian origin. Mullerian carcinoma may most recognizably originate in a pelvic organ, such as the ovary, fallopian tube, or uterus, but it may also be found multifocally in the peritoneum without clear evidence of a particular site of origin, as was the case with this patient. Dr. Panelli: The patient had persistent hypoten-sion after surgery and was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit, where phenylephrine and mechanical ventilatory support were continued. A right pneumothorax was managed with chest-tube placement. On the first day after surgery, the trachea was extubated. The next day, phenyl-ephrine was discontinued, 2 units of packed red cells were transfused, and the patient was trans-ferred to the inpatient unit, where the chest tube was removed 1 day later. Quadrivalent meningo-coccal conjugate vaccine serogroups A, C, Y, and W, 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, and Haemophilus inf luenzae type b conjugate vaccine were administered. On the seventh day after surgery, the patient was discharged home. Three days after discharge and 16 days before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the gynecologic oncology surgery clinic at this hospital for follow-up. She was thought to be recovering well, and the staples were removed from her surgical incision. A plan was made to schedule chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin at the other hospital. Eighteen days after discharge and 1 day before this evaluation, the patient returned to the gynecologic oncology surgery clinic because of fatigue, anorexia, abdominal pain, bloating, and alternating constipation and diarrhea. She had not yet begun chemotherapy. She reported that abdominal pain and irregular bowel movements had been present since surgery and that the night before this presentation, she had tried medical marijuana, which she had obtained from a friend, as a treatment for pain before going to sleep. When she awoke 14 hours later, she felt drowsy and the abdominal pain persisted. Abdominal imaging was performed. Dr. Lowry: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed postsurgical changes that had occurred since she had undergone the peritoneal cytoreduction, total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, splenectomy, and rectosigmoid colon resection. Ascites had decreased, and only trace residual perihepatic fluid was present Fig. 3A. No abscesses were identified. There was no evidence of obstruction or inflammatory changes of the bowel Fig. 3B, and the rectosigmoid anastomosis was unremarkable in appearance Fig. 3C. Dr. Panelli: The patient was admitted to the hospital. On admission, she reported feeling very tired. The temperature was 36.8C, the pulse 97 beats per minute, the blood pressure 154/85 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 29 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while she was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft and mildly distended, without tenderness. The anion gap and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of magnesium, globulin, and total bilirubin; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Intravenous normal saline and oral senna, docu-sate, and magnesium citrate were administered. By the second hospital day, the patient had had multiple bowel movements and the abdominal pain had decreased, but fatigue persisted and fever to a temperature of 39.2C, chills, myalgias, and subjective weakness developed. She underwent further evaluation. The pulse was 93 beats per minute, the blood pressure 138/64 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95 while she was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Additional studies were performed, and the laboratory called with critical information that led to a presumptive diagnosis.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Transfusion-related babesiosis. ", "prediction": "1. High-grade serous carcinoma of mullerian origin: Given the confirmed histopathological findings of high-grade carcinoma with PAX8 positivity and the extensive involvement of abdominal and pelvic structures, this is the most definitive and likely diagnosis.\n\n2. Postoperative infection/sepsis: The patient exhibits fever, chills, myalgias, and persistent fatigue following extensive abdominal surgery, raising the possibility of a postoperative infection leading to sepsis.\n\n3. Microscopic colitis relapse: The recurrence of diarrhea after dosage reduction of budesonide aligns with her history of microscopic colitis.\n\n4. Small bowel obstruction: Although not evidenced by CT, her symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits may suggest partial small bowel obstruction secondary to postoperative adhesions or tumor recurrence.\n\n5. Chemotherapy-induced side effects: If chemotherapy had started, side effects including fatigue, anorexia, and gastrointestinal disturbances could explain her symptoms, though this was noted to not have commenced yet.\n\n6. Adrenal insufficiency: Prolonged corticosteroid use followed by abrupt discontinuation might contribute to adrenal insufficiency, presenting with fatigue, weakness, and hypotension.\n\n7. Sjogren’s syndrome exacerbation: Given her known diagnosis of Sjogren’s syndrome, systemic symptoms such as fatigue and abdominal pain can occasionally present in exacerbations or related complications.\n\n8. Abdominal abscess: Though not seen on the CT scan, the patient's fever, increased respiratory rate, and abdominal pain could hint at a lower likelihood, yet clinically possible abscess formation.\n\n9. Mechanical bowel problems (e.g., paralytic ileus): Postoperative status, changes in bowel habits, and abdominal distension may suggest paralytic ileus as a differential diagnosis.\n\n10. Clostridium difficile colitis: The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics perioperatively increases the risk of C. difficile infection presenting with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and systemic symptoms."}

Cardozo Obstetrics and Gynecology: A 31-year-old woman was seen in the outpatient fertility center of this hospital because of infertility. During the previous 1.5 years, the patient had been well but unable to conceive. During the year before this evaluation, she was seen by physicians at another health care facility for evaluation of infertility. Dr. Aoife Kilcoyne: A hysterosalpingogram was obtained at another hospital 9 months before this evaluation Fig. 1. The uterine cavity had normal volume, symmetric contours, and no mucosal irregularity or filling defects. The proximal fallopian tubes filled promptly and were of normal thin, regular caliber, but the distal ampul-lary and infundibular portions were abnormally dilated and had multiple filling defects. Diverticular outpouchings in the ampullary and infundibular portions of the fallopian tubes were also seen. The lack of free spillage of contrast material into the peritoneal cavity was indicative of bilateral tubal occlusion. Dr. Cardozo: The patient was referred to a fertility consultant at another facility, where she completed two cycles of in vitro fertilization; two high-quality embryos were transferred during each cycle, but there was no successful implantation or viable pregnancy. She was referred to the fertility center at this hospital. The patient reported that menarche had occurred when she was 12 years of age. Her menstrual cycles were regular, were approximately 32 days long with a menstrual flow of 5 days duration, and were associated with minimal dysmenorrhea; her most recent menses had begun 24 days earlier. Results of a Papanicolaou Pap smear performed 13 months earlier were reportedly normal. She had no history of sexually transmitted diseases and had not been exposed to diethylstilbestrol. She had received the bacille CalmetteGuerin BCG vaccine as a child. Her only medication was a multivitamin. She had no known allergies. She drank alcohol infrequently and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. She had been married for 6 years and worked in an office. The patient had been born and raised in Nepal and had most recently visited that country 4 months before this presentation. She had lived in India for 3 years and had immigrated to the United States 5 years earlier, where she had lived in the Southwest, a mid-Atlantic state, and most recently, New England. She exercised regularly, had a normal diet, and had no history of an eating disorder. Her father had hypertension, her maternal grandfather had colon cancer, and her maternal grandmother had diabetes mellitus; her mother and sibling were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg, the height 151 cm, the weight 49.5 kg, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 21.7. The remainder of the examination was normal. A complete blood count, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and blood levels of thyrotropin and prolactin were normal. Tests for IgG antibodies to varicella and rubella were positive, and tests for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, syphilis, and hepatitis B surface antigen were negative. The ABO blood type was A, Rh positive, with negative antibody screening. Twenty-three days later, on day 3 of the patients menstrual cycle, an ultrasound-guided antral follicle count revealed multiple follicles up to 15 mm in diameter in each ovary and normal ovarian volume. The blood level of lu-teinizing hormone was 4.6 U per liter reference range, 2.0 to 15.0 during the follicular phase, 22.0 to 105.0 during the ovulatory phase, and 0.6 to 19.0 during the luteal phase, the level of follicle-stimulating hormone was 3.8 U per liter reference range, 3.0 to 20.0 during the follicular phase, 9.0 to 26.0 during the ovulatory phase, and 1.0 to 12.0 during the luteal phase, and the level of estradiol was 25 pg per milliliter 92 pmol per liter; reference range, 20.0 to 145.0 pg per milliliter 73 to 532 pmol per liter during the follicular phase, 112.0 to 443.0 pg per milliliter 411 to 1626 pmol per liter during the midcycle peak, and 20.0 to 241.0 pg per milliliter 73 to 885 pmol per liter during the luteal phase. Three days later, the patient returned to an outpatient clinic of this hospital. Testing for urinary human gonadotropin was negative. A pelvic examination, Pap smear, and cervical culture were performed. On hysteroscopic examination, the tubal ostia were well visualized and the uterine cavity appeared normal, with no evidence of intrauterine scar tissue, polyps, or fibroids. After the hysteroscopy, an endometrial biopsy was performed. Testing for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae nucleic acids was negative. Dr. Drucilla J. Roberts: The pathology department received the endometrial-biopsy specimen, which consisted of an aggregate of hemorrhagic soft tissue 1 cm in greatest dimension, and the entire specimen was submitted for histologic processing. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the tissue revealed weakly proliferative endome-trium with multiple compact, nonnecrotizing granulomas Fig. 2. No polarizing material was present in the granulomas, and staining for acid-fast bacilli, Fite staining, and Grocott methena-minesilver staining showed no evidence of organisms.

Tubal Factor Infertility: The patient's hysterosalpingogram showed distal tubal dilation and bilateral tubal occlusion, which are indicative of tubal damage and potential underlying pelvic inflammatory disease or tuberculosis.\n2. Tuberculosis (Genital TB): The patient has a history of travel to areas endemic for tuberculosis, and the presence of nonnecrotizing granulomas in the endometrial biopsy is highly suggestive of genital tuberculosis.\n3. Endometriosis: Although her history lacks chronic pelvic pain, the presence of tubal abnormalities could be secondary to endometriosis, which often contributes to infertility.\n4. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID): The patient's history and imaging results suggest past or chronic pelvic inflammatory disease, potentially contributing to tubal occlusion.\n5. Asherman Syndrome: Unlikely in this case due to normal hysteroscopy findings, however prior intrauterine surgeries or infections could cause endometrial scarring leading to infertility.\n6. Unexplained Infertility: Despite a thorough workup, sometimes no clear cause of infertility can be identified, accounting for up to 30% of cases.\n7. Idiopathic Granulomatous Endometritis: Rare but possible with the presence of granulomas in the endometrial biopsy, though typically other causes like TB need to be ruled out first.\n8. Luteal Phase Deficiency: Normal hormone profiles largely rule this out, but it remains a possibility due to subtle endometrial changes affecting implantation.\n9. Environmental Toxins Exposure: Long-term exposure to certain toxins in developing countries could lead to subfertility, although direct evidence is lacking in this patient's history.\n10. Uterine Anomalies: Despite normal hysteroscopy and imaging, subtle congenital anomalies could occasionally be missed and cause infertility."}

Letourneau: A 53-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus with associated nephritis and chronic renal insufficiency was seen in the gynecology clinic of this hospital because of pain and a lump in the left breast. The patient had been in her usual health until 4 months before this presentation, when she noted a small, tender lump in the left breast on self-examination. Evaluation by her primary care physician revealed a firm, slightly mobile mass measuring 5 mm in greatest dimension in the upper inner quadrant of the left breast. The skin overlying the mass appeared normal, and there was no nipple discharge or axillary lymphadenopathy. The right breast and the remainder of the physical examination were normal. Three days earlier, routine laboratory tests had been performed by her nephrologist; the test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Pragya A. Dang: Three days later, combined digital mammography and tomo-synthesis of the left breast was negative, with no suspicious masses, areas of architectural distortion, or microcalcifications Fig. 1. Ultrasonography targeted to the 10 oclock position in the left breast revealed a superficial, hyperechoic, oval mass measuring 6 mm in greatest dimension with circumscribed margins that was located 5 cm from the nipple, in the dermis. The radiologic differential diagnosis included a sebaceous cyst, and the mass was thought to be probably benign. A plan was made to perform follow-up imaging in 6 months. Dr. Letourneau: Two months later, the patient was seen for routine follow-up in the nephrology and rheumatology clinics of this hospital. She reported fatigue, nausea, and epigastric pain. Mild epigastric tenderness was present; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. One month later, computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed no evidence of pancreatitis; there was a new, indeterminate, hyperdense lesion measuring 1.9 cm in greatest dimension in the upper pole of the left kidney. Four months after the patients initial presentation, she was seen in the gynecology clinic of this hospital for a routine annual examination. She reported that pain in the left breast had developed 5 days earlier and that she had noted a lump in the upper outer quadrant. The pain had been persistent, was present throughout the breast, was worst near the nipple, and was unaffected by movement or change in position. The patient had systemic lupus erythematosus with associated nephritis and chronic renal insufficiency, as well as cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis, urticarial vasculitis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, arthralgias, anemia, leukopenia, and a positive test for serum anticardiolipin antibodies. She also had migraine headaches, depression, gastritis, uterine fibroids, allergic rhinitis, gout, and lateral epicondylitis. Menarche had occurred when she was 11 years of age, and menopause when she was 47 years of age. The patient was nulliparous and had not taken hormone-replacement therapy. She had undergone surgery for skin ulcers on the legs 15 years earlier, bilateral cataract removal 14 years earlier, treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection 9 years earlier, endoscopic resection of a left nasopharyngeal cyst 5 years earlier, and arthroscopic surgery for right shoulder impingement syndrome and arthritis of the right acromioclavicular joint 4 years earlier. Medications included hydroxychloroquine, methylprednisolone, enalapril, metoprolol, calcium carbonate–ergocalciferol, aspirin, venlafaxine, omeprazole, and nasal ipratropium, as well as colchicine as needed. The patient had no known allergies to medications; leukopenia had occurred with the administration of mycophenolate. She had emigrated from Brazil 25 years earlier and frequently returned there to visit relatives and friends. She was unemployed and lived with a roommate in a suburban area of New England. She had smoked a half pack of cigarettes per day for 19 years but had stopped smoking 17 years before this evaluation. She drank alcohol on rare occasions and did not use illicit drugs. Her father had had diabetes mellitus, peptic ulcer disease, and nephrolithiasis and had died of sepsis; her mother had had hypertension and had died after a hip fracture. Her maternal grandfather had had gastric cancer, and a paternal aunt had had unspecified gynecologic cancer that was diagnosed when she was 38 years of age. On examination, the patient appeared well. A firm, mildly tender mass (measuring 3 cm by 3 cm) was present in the left breast, between the 2 and 3 o’clock positions; it had no overlying skin abnormalities. A second, smaller mass was located at the 10 o’clock position. There was no nipple discharge or axillary lymphadenopathy. The right breast and the remainder of the physical examination were normal. Pathological examination of a specimen obtained during a Papanicolaou smear revealed atrophic changes and no evidence of an intraepithelial lesion or cancer. Dr. Dang: Two days later, combined digital mammography and tomosynthesis revealed focal asymmetry in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast that had not been present on a previous mammogram and corresponded to the palpable abnormality (Figure 2); no suspicious masses, calcifications, or areas of architectural distortion were seen in the right breast. Ultrasonography targeted to the 2 o’clock position in the left breast revealed an irregular, hypoechoic mass (measuring 20 mm by 20 mm by 19 mm) located 9 cm from the nipple and situated in a background of tissue with heterogeneous echotexture that encompassed the majority of the upper outer quadrant (Figure 2).Dr. Letourneau: Six days after the mammography and ultrasonography were performed, the patient was seen in the outpatient cancer center of this hospital. A lymph node was palpable in the left axilla. The remainder of the physical examination was unchanged. A diagnostic procedure was performed.

Invasive ductal carcinoma: Given the newly identified irregular, hypoechoic mass and palpable lymph node, invasive ductal carcinoma is a strong possibility.\n2. Inflammatory breast cancer: The pain, rapid increase in breast mass size, and skin changes alongside the palpable axillary lymph node could suggest this aggressive form of breast cancer.\n3. Lupus panniculitis: Considering her history of systemic lupus erythematosus, this lupus-related inflammation of the subcutaneous tissue in the breast could present with tender lumps.\n4. Breast abscess: Although less likely without classic signs of infection, her immunosuppressive medications increase the risk for abscess formation.\n5. Fibroadenoma: A benign breast tumor commonly seen in younger women can present as a palpable, mobile mass, though the irregular mass observed makes this less likely.\n6. Sebaceous cyst: Initially suggested by imaging, these benign cysts could become tender if infected or inflamed.\n7. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma: With a new hyperdense lesion in the kidney, metastasis to the breast should be considered, especially given her history of systemic involvement.\n8. Fat necrosis: Traumatic or non-traumatic injury to breast fat tissue could simulate malignancy on imaging and physical examination.\n9. Granulomatous mastitis: Chronic inflammation due to tuberculosis or other granulomatous diseases might mimic malignancy and needs exclusion.\n10.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Daniel J. Daunis Psychiatry: A 63-year-old woman with bipolar disorder, worsening depression, and multiple other medical conditions, including lung cancer and breast cancer, was admitted to the inpatient psychiatry service of this hospital for electroconvulsive therapy ECT. The patient had a long-standing history of bipolar disorder, including depressive episodes, which were characterized by low motivation, low energy, a feeling of hopelessness, agoraphobia, and suicidal ideation without suicide attempts, and brief episodes, each lasting for 2 to 3 weeks, of hypomania and mania with irritable or elevated mood, labile affect, pressured speech, and a decreased need for sleep. Twelve years before this admission, she had received a diagnosis of stage IIA estrogen-recep-torpositive and progesterone-receptorpositive, HER2neu-negative invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast, with lymphatic-vessel invasion and isolated tumor cells in 2 of 2 lymph nodes. The patient underwent lumpectomy and adjuvant whole-breast radiation therapy. Follow-up therapy included four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy and a 5-year course of tamoxifen. She had also been hospitalized three times for mania with psychotic features, including paranoia and visual hallucinations; her most recent hospitalization for mania occurred during her treatment for breast cancer, 11 years before this admission for ECT. She also had attention deficithyperactivity disorder ADHD. Over the years, she had been treated with lithium, stimulants, atypical antipsychotic agents, and multiple classes of antidepressants. Six years before this admission, the patient discontinued primary care follow-up, and shortly thereafter she discontinued psychiatric care. Two years before this admission, a diagnosis of stage II nonsmall-cell carcinoma of the right lung was made. At the time of the diagnosis, she was referred to a psychiatrist at the cancer center of this hospital. Her medications were adjusted, and her depression abated. She underwent a right upper lobectomy and received adjuvant chemotherapy. Approximately 1 year before this admission, the patients depression and anxiety worsened. She missed multiple medical and psychiatric appointments, but she communicated with some practitioners by telephone. She agreed to undergo ECT for refractory depression and was admitted to this hospital. On admission, the patient reported sad mood, low interest, low energy, a feeling of hopelessness, and fear of leaving her home and burdening her husband. She had no hallucinations or thoughts of harming herself or others. She had asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, insomnia, and the restless leg syndrome. A hip fracture had been repaired. Medications on admission included bu-propion, gabapentin, modafinil, quetiapine, and sertraline, as well as inhaled albuterol, ipratropi-um, budesonide, and tiotropium. She was allergic to pramipexole and lithium carbonate, which caused myoclonic movements. She was married and retired, received disability assistance, and lived with her husband, who also had mental illness. Her mother had had depression and had died from myocardial infarction when she was in her 50s, her father had died from leukemia in his 50s, and her paternal grandfather had died from stomach cancer in his 60s. There was no family history of breast cancer or lung cancer. The patient smoked one to two packs of cigarettes daily and did not currently drink alcohol; she had used cannabis, cocaine, and hallucinogens in the distant past and had never used intravenous drugs. On examination, the blood pressure was 140/73 mm Hg, and the pulse 101 beats per minute. The temperature and respiratory rate were normal. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 27.2. The patients appearance was disheveled, her hygiene was fair, and she was alert and understood the reason for her hospitalization. She was easily distracted but cooperative. Her speech was rapid and occasionally loud but interruptible; she was mildly restless. Her mood was sad and her affect alternated between dysphoric and mildly expansive. Her thought process was occasionally tangential but redirectable. There was no evidence of delusion or paranoia, and she did not appear to respond to internal stimuli. She had insight into her worsening depression and agreed to undergo ECT. The physical examination revealed diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheezes. The blood urea nitrogen level was 26 mg per deciliter 9.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter 2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter, the creatinine level was 1.31 mg per deciliter 116 mol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter 53.0 to 133 mol per liter, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate was 41 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area reference value, 60. The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes, vitamin B12, folic acid, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, and thyrotropin were normal, as were results of liver-function tests. Screening tests for syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus antibodies and p24 antigen were nonreactive. An electrocardiogram was normal. Dr. Phoebe E. Freer: Computed tomography CT of the chest was performed to assess the status of the patients known, treated lung cancer. Changes attributed to a lobectomy of the right lower lobe and a segmentectomy of the posterior right upper lobe for a lung cancer were noted, with no new findings or findings that were suspicious for recurrent lung cancer. However, a rim-enhancing mass was noted at the 11 oclock position in the right breast; this mass was new since the previous chest CT scan obtained 16 months earlier Fig. 1A. Mammography and ultrasonog-raphy were recommended as follow-up diagnostic procedures. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head, performed the day after the chest CT, revealed no evidence of an intracranial mass, hemorrhage, or acute infarction. Dr. Daunis: The patient received six ECT treatments during her hospitalization. These treatments resulted in moderate improvement in her mood. She was discharged on the 19th hospital day. Medications on discharge were gabapentin 1200 mg at bedtime, lamotrigine 50 mg daily, modafinil 400 mg daily, and quetiapine 600 mg at bedtime, and tiotropium, ipratropium, and al-buterol sulfate inhalers. Dr. Freer: After the patient was discharged from the hospital, mammography, performed on an outpatient basis, revealed an irregularly shaped mass in the right breast Fig. 1B and 1C, with spicu-lated margins and associated architectural distortion. This finding correlated with that of the chest CT scan and was a new finding since the patients most recent mammogram 2 years earlier Fig. 1D and 1E. Ultrasonography of the right breast, targeted at the 11 oclock position, con-firmed the presence of a solid mass, measuring 14 mm in the maximal dimension, that was highly suspicious for primary breast cancer. A core biopsy was recommended. Dr. Thomas M. Gudewicz: Cytopathological specimens of breast tissue obtained by means of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration contained individual moderately enlarged atypical epithelial cells, as well as clusters of such cells. These cells had a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, irregular nuclear contours, fine chromatin, and occasional small nucleoli Fig. 2A. Mitotic figures were occasionally identifiable. The carcinoma cells were compatible with a primary breast cancer, but they could also have arisen from a metastasis of the lung carcinoma. In addition, other primary carcinomas can metastasize to the breast, including lung, bronchial, endometrial, colon, and thyroid cancers and melanoma. We attempted to distinguish the two tumors through immunohistochemical analysis using a select immunoprofile with thyroid transcription factor 1 TTF1 and mammaglobin. The TTF1 im-munostain is positive in nearly all pulmonary carcinomas and is only rarely positive in breast cancers. Mammaglobin is negative in pulmonary tumors and is generally positive in breast cancers. An attempt was made to stain a cell-block preparation with these two immunostains, but the sample was paucicellular, and the staining was inconclusive. Comparison of the morphologic characteristics of the breast tumor with those of the previous lung tumor showed that cells obtained from the lung tumor had a higher nuclear grade than those obtained from the breast specimen Fig. 2B. A primary breast tumor was therefore considered to be the likely diagnosis. Dr. Daunis: Lumpectomy with a sentinel-lymph-node biopsy was recommended, but the patient reported worsening depression, and she did not keep her follow-up appointments. Management decisions were made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Bipolar I disorder with mixed features; invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast; lung cancer. ", "prediction": "1. Recurrence of Breast Cancer: Given the history of breast cancer and the new mass visualized on CT and mammography, recurrence is highly probable.\n2. Recurrent Lung Cancer: Despite no new findings on recent imaging, the history of lung cancer and the inconclusive immunohistochemical stain warrant consideration of a lung cancer relapse.\n3. Primary Psychiatric Disorder (Bipolar Disorder): The persistent and severe mood disturbances are consistent with her long-standing diagnosis of bipolar disorder.\n4. Major Depressive Disorder: The worsening depression, despite pharmacotherapy, raises the likelihood of major depression resistant to treatment.\n5. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation: Diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheezes point toward exacerbation of COPD.\n6. Asthma: Inspiratory and expiratory wheezes may also indicate poorly controlled asthma.\n7. Medication Side Effects: The extensive pharmacotherapy with multiple psychotropic medications increases the risk of side effects contributing to her current symptoms.\n8. Thyroid Dysfunction: While thyrotropin levels were normal, thyroid dysfunction could present with mood changes, thus cannot be completely ruled out without a comprehensive thyroid panel.\n9. Kidney Dysfunction: Elevated blood urea nitrogen and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate suggest kidney involvement, possibly contributing to her malaise.\n10. Secondary Metastatic Cancer: Metastasis to the breast or other sites from her known lung cancer is also a consideration given her cancer history and current symptoms."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Thomas N. Byrne: A 53-year-old man was seen in the neurology, neurosurgery, and neuroendocrinology clinics of this hospital because of diplopia, polydipsia, and polyuria. The patient had been well until approximately 1 year before this evaluation, when nasal congestion and headache developed. During the next 3 months, his symptoms worsened. Dr. Otto Rapalino: Nine months before this evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head without the administration of contrast material was performed at another hospital Fig. 1A. The imaging studies revealed diffuse mucosal thickening of the right sphenoid sinus, with inspissated secretions filling that sinus, and scattered mild mucosal thickening within the left sphenoid, ethmoid, and maxillary sinuses. Dr. Byrne: The patient was treated with a course of antibiotics, but there was no improvement. One month later, endoscopic sinus surgery with maxillary antros-tomy and septoplasty was performed at a second hospital. Two weeks after surgery approximately 7.5 months before this evaluation, dip-lopia developed that worsened on lateral gaze; there was no ocular pain, proptosis, facial numbness, or swelling. On examination by a neuro-ophthalmologist, mild deficits on abduction that involved both eyes, with the right deficit more severe than the left, and a large-angle esotropia were noted. A diagnosis of a right sixth-nerve palsy was made. Dr. Rapalino: Seven months before this evaluation, MRI of the head with the administration of gadolinium was performed Fig. 1B. The imaging studies revealed changes consistent with persistent inflammation of the sphenoid sinuses and diffuse enlargement of the pituitary gland, which measured 17 mm in the maximal transverse dimension and 9 mm in the maximal craniocaudal dimension. Dr. Byrne: Methylprednisolone and antibiotics were administered for 3 weeks, and the diplopia resolved 6 weeks after onset. Mild to moderately severe headaches, worse in the evenings, persisted. Approximately 4.5 months before this evaluation, polydipsia and polyuria developed. Urine volume measured up to 6 liters daily, and the specific gravity was less than 1.005. The level of plasma antidiuretic hormone was reportedly undetectable during a water-deprivation test. The urine osmolality did not increase in response to water deprivation but increased by 150 after the administration of desmopressin. Treatment with nasally administered desmopressin was begun and resulted in a decrease in urinary frequency, nocturia, and thirst. Dr. Rapalino: Three months before this evaluation, repeat MRI of the head, performed with the administration of gadolinium Fig. 1C, revealed extensive mucosal thickening and partial filling of the right sphenoid sinus with secretions, with enlargement of the pituitary gland to 19 mm by 11 mm by 13 mm maximal transverse, craniocau-dal, and anteroposterior dimensions, respectively, as compared with 16 mm by 7 mm by 11 mm 7 months earlier and 17 mm by 9 mm by 12 mm 5 months earlier. The pituitary gland showed homogeneous enhancement after gadolinium administration and had an abnormal superior convexity. The infundibular stalk also appeared to be mildly thickened. Dr. Byrne: Eight days after the repeat MRI was performed, diplopia recurred. Approximately 6 weeks before this evaluation, neuro-ophthal-mologic examination revealed minor bilateral abduction deficits. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid CSF showed 4 white cells per cubic millimeter 97 lymphocytes and 3 monocytes, a protein level of 66 mg per deciliter reference range, 15 to 45, and normal levels of glucose, alpha-fetoprotein, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. The test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. The patient was prescribed a 3-week course of levofloxacin and referred to this hospital. On evaluation at this hospital, the patient reported nocturia and mild headache; his diplopia had resolved within the previous month. He had been physically active and had run 12 miles weekly until 3 months before this evaluation, when leg fatigue developed. He shaved daily and reported a weight gain of 3 to 4 kg 6 to 8 lb, mild muscle soreness, and extreme sensitivity to cold. His shoe size had increased by half a size over a period of several years. He had no unexplained sweating, arthralgias, nausea, constipation, dizziness, faintness, breast tenderness, edema, bruising, rash, erectile dysfunction, low libido, or history of colon polyps. He had had hepatitis A virus infection and had undergone knee arthroscopy in the remote past. He had undergone herniorrhaphy as an infant. Medications included desmopressin nasal spray administered twice daily, levofloxacin, and, as needed, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and diphenhydramine. He had no known allergies. He was married, lived in a midwestern state, and worked in sales. He did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. His father had died from amyo-trophic lateral sclerosis, and his mother from lung cancer; his mother had also had hypothyroidism. On examination, the vital signs were normal, as was the otolaryngologic examination. The unlikely. frontal and maxillary sinuses were not tender, and nasal endoscopy revealed normal mucosa; there was no evidence of mucopurulent discharge, and the lacrimal and salivary glands were normal. There was no proptosis or ocular inflammation. The remainder of the general and neurologic examination, including examination of the cranial nerves, was normal. The white-cell count, white-cell differential count, and platelet count were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, albumin, globulin, total protein, glucose, calculated mean blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, calcium, and prostate-specific antigen. Results of liver-function and renal-function tests were normal, as was the urinalysis; other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram and a chest radiograph were normal. Dr. Rapalino: MRI of the pituitary, performed both without and with the administration of gadolinium Fig. 1D and 2B and 2E, revealed diffuse enlargement of the pituitary gland and the infundibular stalk, preservation of the sellar floor, and extensive mucosal thickening in the sphenoid sinus. On T2-weighted images, circumferential hypointense and enhancing soft tissue was again noted, partially filling the right sphe-noid sinus; the size of the soft tissue was larger than its size on the first MRI but was stable when compared with the finding on the imaging study performed 7 months earlier. Computed tomography CT of the face and sinuses showed expansion of the pituitary fossa and thickening and sclerosis of the adjacent sphenoid sinus walls, findings that suggested chronic inflammatory changes Fig. 2A and 2D. Dr. Byrne: A diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "IgG4-related hypophysitis.", "prediction": "1. Central Diabetes Insipidus: The undetectable plasma antidiuretic hormone level and significant response to desmopressin administration suggest central diabetes insipidus.\n2. Pituitary Macroadenoma: The MRI findings of an enlarged pituitary gland with a thickened infundibular stalk and abnormal superior convexity indicate a possible pituitary macroadenoma.\n3. Lymphocytic Hypophysitis: The MRI findings and CSF analysis showing mild lymphocytic pleocytosis are consistent with lymphocytic hypophysitis, an inflammatory condition of the pituitary.\n4. Sinusitis-Induced Pituitary Dysfunction: The persistent sinusitis and thickening of sphenoid sinus mucosa on imaging could lead to compression or inflammation affecting the pituitary gland function.\n5. Pituitary Abscess: Although rare, the persistent inflammation and enlargement of the pituitary gland on MRI could indicate a pituitary abscess, especially given the history of infection.\n6. Rathke's Cleft Cyst: The recurrent headaches and MRI findings could be attributed to Rathke's cleft cysts, which are cystic lesions derived from remnants of Rathke's pouch.\n7. Sarcoidosis: Granulomatous inflammation, such as in sarcoidosis, could cause the pituitary and infundibular enlargement seen on MRI and the mild lymphocytic predominance in CSF.\n8. Acromegaly: The increased shoe size, along with the pituitary enlargement on MRI, could suggest acromegaly, although the lack of other typical symptoms makes it less likely.\n9. Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Orbital Complication: Chronic inflammation of the sinuses may extend to orbital structures causing diplopia without visible proptosis or swelling.\n10. Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome: This painful ophthalmoplegia can cause recurrent cranial nerve palsies and headaches, fitting some aspects of the patient's clinical presentation and MRI findings."}

Dichtel Endocrinology: A 20-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of gynecomastia. The patient came to the hospital for a routine annual examination to establish adult care. He reported a 3-year history of bilateral breast enlargement, with no nipple discharge. He had occasional morning erections, had never been sexually active, and did not masturbate. Approximately 4 years before this evaluation, increased thirst and fluid consumption and frequent urination four to five times during the day and up to three times each night had developed. The patients parents reportedly worried that he might have diabetes, but a urinary glucose screen was negative and further evaluation was not pursued. In recent months, the frequency of urination had decreased and thirst was normal. He also reported a several-year history of blurred vision, which had been corrected with glasses; he had no diplopia and had occasional headaches after exertion. Puberty was reportedly normal. Approximately 8 months before this presentation, the frequency of shaving decreased from weekly to every 2 weeks. Generalized nocturnal tonicclonic seizures and focal seizures involving the right leg had occurred when the patient was between 6 and 13 years of age approximately twice yearly, for a total of 10 to 13 generalized seizures; carbamaze-pine had been prescribed until the patient was 14 years of age, after which the seizures did not recur. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head, performed at another hospital when the patient was 7 years of age, had reportedly revealed no abnormalities. His wisdom teeth had been extracted 6 months before this evaluation. He had recent constipation and a chronic pilonidal cyst. He took no medications and had no known allergies. He was a college student and lived with his parents. He drank alcohol rarely and had never smoked or used illicit drugs. His father had had a basal-cell carcinoma, a maternal uncle had had colon cancer at 36 years of age, his paternal grandfather had died of colon cancer, and his maternal grandfather had had renal cancer. On examination, the patient appeared young for his age, with minimal facial hair. The blood pressure was 98/62 mm Hg; the other vital signs were normal. The height was 179 cm, the weight 85 kg, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 26.5. Both breasts were enlarged, with no nipple retraction, masses, or discharge. The testicles were small approximately 2.5 cm in length. There was a small posterior anal fissure and a small lump over the coccyx with a central punctum and no discharge; the remainder of the examination was normal. The stool was negative for occult blood. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, platelet count, and white-cell count were normal; the white cells consisted of 37.3 neutrophils reference range, 40 to 62, 49.3 lymphocytes reference range, 27 to 40, and normal percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. During the next 3 days, additional laboratory test results were obtained Table 1. Urinalysis was normal; the specific gravity was 1.008 reference range, 1.001 to 1.035. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Katelyn M. Dorney Obstetrics and Gynecology: A 30-year-old woman presented to the emergency department of this hospital with chills and sudden worsening of abdominal pain in both lower quadrants. The patient was in her usual good health until 10 days before admission, when, after eating at a restaurant, she had nonbloody, nonbilious emesis that she attributed to food poisoning. The vomiting persisted for 2 days and then resolved. One day later, bilateral abdominal pain developed; the pain waxed and waned for a few days. She then completed a 2-day driving trip as part of her relocation to New England for a new job. During the trip, she had watery, nonbloody diarrhea every time she tried to eat about four times per day. Her travel companion ate foods that were similar to the foods she ate but was well. After the patient arrived at her final destination, chills, fevers, and sharp abdominal pain in both lower quadrants, with bloating, developed. She took naproxen every 8 hours for the pain and noted some improvement. She had minimal appetite, and she noted that the frequency of the diarrheal episodes decreased when her eating decreased. However, abdominal pain persisted and intensified until she rated it as 9 to 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. Two nights later, she was seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of abdominal pain and distention, diarrhea, and chills. On arrival, the patient reported nausea and increased abdominal pain without further episodes of emesis. There was no hematochezia, melena, vaginal discharge, dysuria, or foul-smelling urine. Menarche had occurred at 12 years of age. Her menstrual periods occurred in normal 30-day cycles; her most recent menstrual period had been 2 weeks before this presentation. She had had no known contact with persons who were ill. She had no chest, flank, back, or neck pain, no dyspnea, and no swelling or pain in the calves. She had not lost weight. The patient had a history of a 1-cm ovarian cyst, which had been identified during her early teenage years. She was of East Asian descent, had lived in the Midwest for the previous 10 years, and worked in a medical field. At presentation, she was taking no medications except naproxen, as well as ibuprofen for pain during menstruation. She had no known drug allergies. She did not smoke or use alcohol or illicit drugs. She had never been sexually active. Her father had diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. There was no family history of cancer. On examination, the temperature was 36.5C, the heart rate 129 beats per minute, the blood pressure 123/66 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. Her body was well developed. She appeared to be uncomfortable except when she was lying flat. She appeared to be flushed, but there was no scleral icterus or rash. She had tachycardia, but the cardiac examination was otherwise normal. The abdomen was mildly distended, with tenderness in both lower quadrants that was worst in the midline; there was voluntary guarding on palpation but no rebound, and bowel sounds were diminished. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of coagulation tests were normal, as were red-cell indexes and blood levels of magnesium and globulin; other test results are shown in Table 1. Two sets of blood culture specimens and a urine culture specimen were obtained. A chest radiograph showed low lung volumes and patchy bibasilar opacities. A urine test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Intravenous normal saline, ciprofloxacin, metro-nidazole, and morphine were administered. Imaging studies were obtained and additional diagnostic procedures were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Ruptured endometrioma with infection. ", "prediction": "1. Acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): The patient's symptoms of bilateral lower abdominal pain, fever, chills, and history of an ovarian cyst raise the likelihood of PID, even though she reports no sexual activity, which could also be due to non-sexually transmitted pathogens.\n2. Gastroenteritis: A history of vomiting and diarrhea following a meal at a restaurant suggests bacterial or viral gastroenteritis, although the persistently severe abdominal pain makes other diagnoses more likely.\n3. Appendicitis: While the pain is bilateral, the intensity and lower abdominal location necessitate the consideration of appendicitis, particularly if the appendix is in an atypical location.\n4. Diverticulitis: This condition can cause lower abdominal pain and fever, yet it is less common in a young patient unless there is a predisposing factor.\n5. Ovarian torsion: Sudden onset of severe lower abdominal pain in a young woman with a known ovarian cyst could suggest ovarian torsion, a surgical emergency.\n6. Endometriosis: Given her menstrual history and severe pain, endometriosis must be considered despite lacking classic cyclic symptoms.\n7. Infectious colitis: The history of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and possible exposure to contaminated food fits an infectious colitis framework; however, no bloody stools were reported.\n8. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): The waxing and waning abdominal pain and history of diarrhea could indicate IBS, though the acute severity and associated systemic symptoms make this less likely.\n9. Mesenteric ischemia: Severe abdominal pain out of proportion to physical findings could suggest mesenteric ischemia, especially considering the elevated heart rate.\n10. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): Conditions such as Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis may present with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and systemic symptoms, necessitating further investigations for these chronic diseases."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Angela E. Lin: A 17-year-old boy was referred to the medical genetics clinic of this hospital because of high myopia i.e., severe nearsightedness and craniofacial and other skeletal abnormalities. As a child, the patient had had difficulty with articulation and had received speech therapy. When he was approximately 12 years of age, dental crowding and class III dentofacial growth pattern were noted class I growth pattern indicates normal development, class II indicates protrusion of the maxilla, and class III indicates protrusion of the mandible, and between 12 and 16 years of age, the patient had orthodontic braces and a palate expander. After the braces were removed, difficulty eating and chewing reportedly worsened. Eight weeks before this evaluation, he was referred to the outpatient Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery department at this hospital. Dr. Maria J. Troulis: On examination, the patient had frontal bossing, downward-slanted lateral canthi, symmetric hypoplasia of the midface and maxilla, and relative mandibular hyperplasia i.e., hyperplasia of the mandible relative to the size of the maxilla and midface Fig. 1A and 1B. There was a negative overjet of more than 10 mm i.e., the mandibular teeth extended more than 10 mm horizontally beyond the maxillary teeth, and the lower teeth were retroclined. The ears were in a normal position, but they protruded outward. He was referred to the medical genetics clinic for evaluation of a possible genetic cause of these and other skeletal abnormalities. Dr. Lin: The patient was born at full term by vaginal delivery; his birth weight was 4.3 kg. A pectus excavatum was present at birth. His height was at the 80th percentile until he was 15 years of age, after which it plateaued at the 55th percentile. No developmental delays were noted during childhood. An intermittent systolic heart murmur, which was graded 3 out of 6 with 1 indicating a soft murmur and 6 indicating a loud murmur had first been noted when the patient was 13 years of age. Evaluations by three cardiologists during the next 4 years revealed no cardiovascular symptoms or decreased capacity; electrocardiograms showed an indeterminate axis, and echocardiographic studies reportedly revealed a normal aortic-root size and no evidence of anomalous vasculature, atrial septal defect, valvular structural abnormalities, or findings suggestive of Marfans syndrome. The murmur was thought to be turbulence related to the position of the heart in relation to the pectus deformity. On cardioge-netic examination performed at another hospital when the patient was 16 years of age, his weight was 69.2 kg, the height 177.8 cm, the arm span 188 cm, the ratio of arm span to height 1.06, and the ratio of upper to lower body segment 0.87. Pectus excavatum of the upper chest and pectus carinatum of the lower chest were seen, as were broad thumbs, with no evidence of joint hypermobility. Although there was insufficient evidence to diagnose Marfans syndrome, a connective tissue abnormality was suspected. He was referred to a medical geneticist, but his family acknowledged that they were focused on the craniofacial evaluation. Dr. Teresa C. Chen: When the patient was 13 years of age, a diagnosis of myopia was made, and eyeglasses were prescribed by his optometrist. Over the course of the next 4 years, examinations performed at the optometrists office showed an increase of 12.75 diopters of myopia in the right eye and an increase of 11.00 diopters in the left eye. Nine months before this evaluation, his manifest refraction was reportedly 13.75 diopters in the right eye and 10.00 diopters in the left eye. Eight months before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the ophthalmology clinic at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. On examination, his right eye refracted to a spherical equivalent of 14.50 diopters and his left eye refracted to a spherical equivalent of 11.00 diopters. Visual acuity was 2020 in both eyes when the patient was wearing eyeglasses. The anterior chambers were shallow Fig. 1C, and the angles were open on gonioscopy. The lenses were rounder and smaller than normal, and the lens perimeters and zonules were clearly visible in both eyes after dilation Fig. 1D. The findings on ultrasound biomicroscopy were consistent with microspherophakia small, spherically shaped lenses Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org, with lens diameters of 8.41 mm in the right eye and 8.03 mm in the left eye normal diameter, 9 mm. Lens thickness values were 4.97 mm in each eye. Axial lengths were 24.15 mm in the right eye and 23.91 mm in the left eye. Ultrasonography confirmed shallow anterior chambers, with anterior chamber depths of 2.20 mm in the right eye and 2.82 mm in the left eye normal depth, 3.00 mm. Dr. Lin: The patient had had no serious childhood illnesses. He had bilateral epididymal cysts that had been stable for many years, had undergone repair of urethral meatal stenosis, had had an impacted fracture of the wrist owing to a sports-related injury when he was 12 years of age, and had transient musculoskeletal back pain. He was not taking any medications. He had received all routine childhood immunizations and was allergic to melons. He lived with his parents and brother, and he did well in school. He had never used tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. The patients brother, who was 3 years older than the patient, had a deep asymmetric pectus excavatum and a history of sports-related injuries, including several ankle injuries and recurrent avulsion of a hip joint associated with kicking. He did not wear eyeglasses and had no unusual facial features except for a mild underbite. The patients mother was of Irish and Italian ancestry, and his father was of Italian, Portuguese, Irish, and Scottish ancestry; there was no known consanguinity. His father and multiple paternal relatives had hypertension; his paternal grandfather had coronary artery disease, his grandmother had an endocrine brain tumor, his aunt had Crohns disease, and an uncle had arthritis. His mother was healthy, his maternal grandmother had non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and a cousin had celiac disease. His mother, maternal grandmother, and aunt were 165 cm tall; his brother and maternal grandfather were 170 cm tall; and his father was 175 cm tall. On examination, the blood pressure and pulse were normal. The weight was 66.3 kg 48th percentile, the height 177.5 cm 58th percentile, and the head circumference 58.5 cm 98th percentile. There was slight frontal bossing. The conjunctivae were clear, and the sclerae were white, without blue or gray hue. There was a mixed chest-wall defect, with funnel-shaped pec-tus excavatum and lower sternal protrusion with protrusion of parasternal cartilages Fig. 1E and 1F. A harsh, grade 3 systolic murmur was heard at the upper sternal border, without systolic click or diastolic murmur. There was loss of the normal upper curvature of the spine, as well as scoliosis, with the scapula and rib cage on the right side higher than the left. The remainder of the examination was normal or unchanged from recent previous examinations. The patient had above-average intelligence and was reserved. He asked thoughtful questions and consented to the proposed evaluations. A dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan Fig. 2B revealed an abnormally low bone mineral density of 0.75 g per square centimeter averaged over vertebral bodies L1 through L4; when compared with age-matched controls, this value resulted in a z score of 2.7, which is indicative of osteoporosis. Dr. Lin: The blood level of phosphorus was 4.7 mg per deciliter reference range, 3.0 to 4.5, and the level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was 19 ng per milliliter desired level, 32. A complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes, folic acid, vitamin B12, calcium, glucose, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal. Tests of renal function were also normal. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Homocystinuria caused by cystathionine β-syn-thase deficiency. ", "prediction": "1. Stickler Syndrome: The combination of high myopia, midface hypoplasia, and craniofacial abnormalities with skeletal findings suggests a connective tissue disorder, specifically Stickler syndrome.\n2. Loeys-Dietz Syndrome: Features such as craniofacial abnormalities, pectus deformities, scoliosis, and cardiovascular involvement could indicate this connective tissue disorder, even in the absence of clearly identifiable joint hypermobility.\n3. Marfan Syndrome: Although not definitively diagnosed, the presence of aortic root size evaluations, pectus deformities, and a systolic murmur are suggestive of Marfan syndrome.\n4. Sphrentinopathy: The microspherophakia and severe myopia support a potential diagnosis of a lens-related genetic disorder like sphrentinopathy.\n5. Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome: Given the ocular findings and facial features, this genetic condition that includes high myopia and dental abnormalities is a possibility.\n6. Kniest Dysplasia: This condition, presenting with severe myopia, short stature relative to family members, and skeletal dysplasia, should be considered.\n7. Multiple Epiphyseal Dysplasia: The patient’s history of joint issues, orthopedic interventions, and family history points towards a hereditary skeletal dysplasia like multiple epiphyseal dysplasia.\n8. Homocystinuria: The combination of skeletal abnormalities, scoliosis, osteoporosis, and a history of cardiovascular murmur suggests metabolic/genetic causes such as homocystinuria.\n9. Bruck Syndrome: The patient’s low bone mineral density, fractures, and dental issues could indicate a rare connective tissue disorder like Bruck syndrome.\n10. Juvenile Osteoporosis: Given the early onset of low bone density leading to fractures and skeletal deformities, juvenile osteoporosis needs to be ruled out."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Nneka N. Ufere Medicine: A 50-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of elevated levels of serum aminotransferases, hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, and acute kidney injury. The patient had been well until 6 days before admission, when fatigue and malaise developed. The next day, he had multiple episodes of nonbloody, nonbil-ious vomiting, accompanied by abdominal distention and diffuse abdominal pain. He felt feverish, but his temperature was 35.5C. He took an unknown nonprescription medication for pain and one dose of ciprofloxacin that was provided by a family member. Three days before admission, his family noted yellowing of the skin and eyes and brought him to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On examination in the emergency department, the temperature was 36.7C, the blood pressure 122/81 mm Hg, the pulse 71 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 92 while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was alert and oriented and had no asterixis. The skin was jaundiced, the sclerae were icteric, and the abdomen was protuberant and not tender. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood level of acetaminophen was less than 3 g per milliliter reference range, 10 to 25, and tests for hepatitis A virus HAV IgM antibodies, hepatitis B virus HBV surface antigen, hepatitis B virus HBV core IgM antibodies, hepatitis C virus HCV antibodies, and human immunodeficiency virus HIV type 1 HIV-1 p24 antigen and HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An interferon-gamma release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was performed, and an abdominal ultrasound was obtained. Dr. Stephen R. Lee: Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed a patent portal vein and coarse and heterogeneous echotexture of the liver, with no focal lesions. The gallbladder was contracted, with a thickened wall and biliary sludge Fig. 1; there were no gallstones, and testing for a sonographic Murphys sign was negative. The renal parenchyma was echogenic in both kidneys. Dr. Ufere: N-acetylcysteine was administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Nausea and intermittent vomiting persisted; a nonproductive cough devel-oped, but the patient remained afebrile. The oxygen saturation, as measured by means of a pulse oximeter placed on the finger, was intermittently as low as 85, and supplemental oxygen, adjusted to a rate of 2 to 4 liters per minute to ensure adequate oxygenation, was administered through a nasal cannula. On the second hospital day, computed tomography of the chest, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material to assess for the presence of a pulmonary embolism, showed trace pleural effusion in the right lung and dependent atelectasis in both lungs, without evidence of pulmonary embolism. The arterial oxygen saturation, as measured by arterial blood gas testing, was greater than 99, despite low peripheral oxygen saturation levels measured by a pulse oximeter on the finger. On the third hospital day, acute kidney injury developed, the degree of anemia worsened, and the patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed anisocytosis, burr cells, spur cells, very few schistocytes, nucleated red cells, and polymorphonuclear cells with toxic granulation. A direct antiglobulin test was negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Two units of packed red cells were transfused, piper-acillintazobactam was administered, and the patient was transferred by ambulance to the medical intensive care unit of this hospital. On admission, the patient reported occasional dark stools and mild, diffuse abdominal pain exacerbated by deep breaths. He had hyperlipid-emia, and 7 months before admission he had taken an unknown cholesterol-lowering medication for a period of 2 months. He currently took no medications, herbal supplements, or Ayurvedic therapies. He last drank alcohol 6 months before admission, but he previously drank in a binge pattern, consuming 8 to 10 alcoholic drinks at a time, several days per month. He resided in a rural community in northern India, worked as a horticulturalist, and had cattle on his property. Two weeks before admission, he had traveled to New England to visit his pregnant daughter. Before traveling, he had attended several weddings in northern India, where the meals were shared among the guests, but he had had no known contact with persons who were ill. The patients father had reportedly died of an unspecified form of liver disease in his sixth decade of life. On examination, the temperature was 36.9C, the blood pressure 138/82 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94 while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. He was alert and oriented and had no dysarthria or asterixis. The skin was jaundiced, and the sclerae were icteric. The skin was without spider angiomas or palmar erythema. The first and second heart sounds were normal and without murmurs, and the jugular venous pulsation was not distended. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft and mildly distended, with minimally diffuse tenderness to palpation. The liver edge was palpable and non-tender, with no splenomegaly. There was no edema in his arms or legs. Rectal examination revealed brown stool that tested positive for fecal occult blood. Urinalysis showed 2 glucose, 2 bilirubin, 2 blood, 2 protein, a specific gravity of 1.010 reference range, 1.001 to 1.035, and a pH of 7 reference range, 5 to 9. In a random urine sample, the urinary sodium level was 67 mmol per liter, and the urinary creatinine level was 36 mg per deciliter. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Lee: Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen performed after the administration of gadolinium showed mild changes suggestive of diffuse hepatic steatosis, a contracted gallbladder with gallbladder-wall edema, and fluid and fat stranding surrounding the second and third portions of the duodenum; the portal vein was not well visualized Fig. 2. Dr. Ufere: N-acetylcysteine and piperacillintazo-bactam were continued. Nephrology and hepa-tology consultations were obtained. Diagnostic tests were performed.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Diane R. Pearl Medicine: An 86-year-old woman was seen in the outpatient clinic of the cancer center at this hospital because of fatigue, night sweats, leukocytosis, and splenomegaly. The patient had a history of hypothyroidism and Lyme disease but was otherwise well until approximately 3 months before presentation, when progressive fatigue developed while she was traveling during the summer. Two months before presentation, she was seen by her physician at another hospital. On examination, the blood pressure was 170/80 mm Hg; the remainder of the examination was normal. The thyrotropin level was 7.9 U per milliliter reference range, 0.34 to 4.82; testing for Lyme disease was negative, and the creatine kinase level was normal. The patients dose of levothyroxine was increased from 50 g to 75 g daily. One week later, generalized unsteadiness developed. Computed tomography CT of the head, performed without the use of intravenous contrast material, showed no evidence of intracranial mass, hemorrhage, or infarct and was unchanged from imaging studies obtained 1 year earlier. Approximately 1 month before the current evaluation, fatigue markedly worsened, and diffuse muscle aches developed, which were associated with pain that radiated down both legs. Nine days before this evaluation, the patient went to the emergency department at the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.9C, the blood pressure 150/69 mm Hg, the pulse 67 beats per minute, the respiration rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95 while she was breathing ambient air. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, total protein, and albumin; results of renal function tests were also normal. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained, and doxycycline was administered. The patient was advised that her symptoms were not consistent with Lyme disease and was instructed to see her primary care physician for further evaluation. Four days later, on examination at her physicians office, the patient reported recent night sweats that were so drenching that she had had to change her nightgown. On examination, the blood pressure was 141/69 mm Hg, and the abdomen was soft and slightly distended; the remainder of the examination was normal. Levels of total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin were normal; additional test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Naveen M. Kulkarni: The next day, CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed dependent atelectatic changes in both lungs Fig. 1, a low-attenuation lesion measuring 15 mm in diameter that was consistent with a hepatic cyst with no biliary-duct dilatation, spleno-megaly maximal span, 15 cm normal span, 13, a renal cyst that appeared to be benign, atherosclerotic calcifications, and osteopenia. No evidence of metastatic disease in the abdomen or pelvis was seen. Dr. Pearl: The patient was referred to the cancer center at this hospital. On evaluation, she reported feeling tired and having intermittent muscle aches and night sweats. She reported no abnormal bleeding, bruising, shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, change in appetite or sleeping pattern, weight loss, rash, pruritus, or known recent tick bite. She had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, glaucoma, a history of babesiosis, and a history of recurrent urinary tract infections; she also reported having had depression after the death of her husband. A diagnosis of Lyme disease had been made 14 months earlier, when she presented with erythema migrans and fatigue. Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for a period of 2 weeks was administered, and the rash resolved. Two months later, body aches and night sweats developed but resolved after a brief period; testing for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi and polymerase-chain-reaction assays for Babesia microti and Anaplasma phagocytophilum nucleic acids were negative; other test results are shown in Table 1. She had had a hysterectomy for uterine prolapse, unilateral oophorectomy after an ectopic pregnancy, lumbar laminectomy, partial colectomy for diverticulosis, and bilateral total knee replacement. Daily medications and supplements included aspirin 81 mg, losartan, atorvastatin, calcium 40 mg, levothyroxine, celecoxib 200 mg, vitamin D, a multivitamin, cranberry tablets, and latanoprost ophthalmic solution, as well as loraz-epam 0.5 mg, as needed at night. She had no known allergies to medications. She lived alone in a coastal area of New England and had retired after working in education. She was physically active. She drank two alcoholic beverages each evening, had stopped smoking more than 50 years earlier after casual use, and did not use illicit drugs. Her father and sister had died of lung cancer, and her mother had died when she was older than 90 years of age. Her adult children were healthy. On examination, the patient looked younger than her stated age. The temperature was 37.1C, the blood pressure 146/62 mm Hg, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the respiration rate 18 breaths per minute, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 25.4. The tip of the spleen was felt 1 to 2 cm below the left costal margin, and there was trace edema in both ankles. There was no lymph-adenopathy, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Results of tests of coagulation and renal function were normal, as were blood levels of magnesium, phosphorus, and uric acid. Additional test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Chronic neutrophilic leukemia. ", "prediction": "1.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Alessio Morley-Fletcher Pediatrics: A girl 14 months 19 days of age was admitted to a community hospital affiliated with this hospital because of episodes of recurrent vomiting. The patient had been well until she was 11 months 12 days of age, when intermittent vomiting developed. On the fourth day of symptoms, she was seen by a pediatrician. The stools were reportedly soft but formed, with no diarrhea. A diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis was made, and dietary changes were advised. The patient returned home, and the symptoms resolved. On routine examination when she was 12 months of age, her parents reported that she could perform activities that were developmentally appropriate for her age, including walking, holding on, and using a cup; physical examination was normal. Routine childhood immunizations were administered. During the next 2 months, the patient had two episodes of recurrent vomiting; the episodes lasted 3 days and 5 days and were associated with lethargy and decreased oral intake, as well as with diarrhea on some but not all occasions. During each episode, an examination performed in the emergency department of the other hospital was normal, and no fever or abdominal pain was present. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis with dehydration was made during each episode. Ondansetron and intravenous fluids were administered, and the patient returned home. The episodes resolved spontaneously. Three weeks before the current admission, milk formula was stopped and a soy-based formula was begun. Eighteen days before the current admission to the other hospital, the patient was seen by a pediatric gastroenterologist at this hospital. Examination was normal, and a possible diagnosis of vomiting caused by nonketotic hypoglycemia was made. Her parents were advised to seek a medical evaluation for her, including metabolic studies, if another episode occurred. On the day of admission, four episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting occurred in the evening, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of the other hospital. The patient had been born at full-term gestation, without complications during gestation or delivery. The weight at birth was 3.3 kg, and the length 50.2 cm. The Apgar scores at 1 minute and 5 minutes were 8 and 9, respec-tively. Jaundice was noted during the newborn period. The patient was breast-fed exclusively for 8 weeks and received supplemental formula thereafter, and solid foods were introduced at 5 months. She had mild facial eczema. She received no medications and had no known allergies. Her father had gallstones and had had pancreatitis in his 20s, her paternal grandmother had gallstones, her paternal grandfather had colon cancer, both grandfathers had diabetes mellitus, her maternal grandfather had arthritis, and a distant paternal cousin had Crohns disease; there was no family history of celiac disease. On examination in the emergency department, the patient vomited and had dry heaves intermittently. There was a regular heart rate and rhythm, and the temperature, respiratory rate, and remainder of the general examination were normal. Blood levels of amylase, lipase, ammonia, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, pyruvate kinase, and amino acids were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed 1 ketones and leukocyte esterase by dipstick and 5 white cells per high-power field; screening for toxins in the urine was negative, and a urine culture was sterile. A presumptive diagnosis of gastroenteritis was made, and the patient was admitted to the pediatric inpatient unit for observation and rehydration. On admission to the pediatric inpatient unit, additional history was obtained from the patients parents. They reported that in retrospect, during the previous 3 months, the patient had stopped pulling to stand or attempting to walk and was only crawling and when doing so appeared to be unsteady, with occasional face plants. They noted occasional shakes when she woke up in the morning, which consisted of symmetric movement for a few seconds that would recur over a 10-minute period, without loss of tone or consciousness. On examination, the patient was alert and interactive. Frontal bossing was present and the fontanelle was full, with mild pulsations that were visible anteriorly when she was in the supine position. The weight was 9.9 kg, the length 78.3 cm, and the head circumference 51.5 cm 95th percentile. The eye movements were normal, the pupils were equally reactive, and there was no horizontal or vertical limitation or nystag-mus. The legs had decreased muscle tone, with brisk 3 patellar reflexes, and the plantar reflexes were flexor. There was no crossed adductor reflex i.e., no contraction of both hip adduc-tors when the knee jerk was elicited on either side, which is a sign of pyramidal tract dysfunction in patients older than 8 months of age and no ankle clonus. The remainder of the examination was normal, including evaluation of the muscle tone in the shoulder girdle. The hemato-crit, hemoglobin level, red-cell indexes, white-cell count, and white-cell differential count were normal; additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patients pediatrician was contacted for additional information about her growth Fig. 1. A diagnostic test was performed, and the patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Bradford C. Dickerson: A 70-year-old woman was seen in the memory disorders clinic of this hospital because of progressive cognitive difficulties involving word finding. She was interviewed with the assistance of her daughter. The patient had reportedly been well until approximately 8 years before this evaluation, when gradually progressive difficulties with word finding developed, along with associated confusion about the meaning of some words. For example, during a conversation about a recent family event, she did not understand what the phrase punch bowl meant. She also had increased egocentric behavior, during which she spoke most frequently about herself. She had a good memory for recent events of her life and could recount multiple stories at times to an excessive extent during history taking, such that she required refocusing. She had an excellent sense of direction. She had an uncharacteristically matter-of-fact reaction to the death of a sibling and of her dog being less upset than her family expected. She occasionally had mildly inappropriate behavior, such as saying I love you to people to whom she was not particularly close. The patient was right-handed. Approximately 10 years earlier, she had a tick bite and was treated with antibiotic agents after a test for Lyme disease was positive. When she was 7 years of age, she fell out of a tree and hit her head, but she did not lose consciousness and was not hospitalized. There was no history of recent head injury, stroke, seizure, transient ischemic attack, meningitis, encephalitis, exposure to human immunodeficiency virus, thyroid disorder, heart disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, liver disease, kidney disease, cancer, pulmonary disorders, exposure to heavy metals, or learning disability. Her only surgical history included three cesarean sections. Her medications were a multivitamin, vitamin C, ginkgo biloba, calcium, magnesium, and zinc, and she had no known allergies. Since the death of her husband 10 years earlier, she had lived alone in a different state than her daughter and was able to perform all activities of daily living independently, including managing her money, paying bills, and volunteering in the com-munity i.e., visiting senior centers to play piano and attending regular community choir practices. She drank alcohol once or twice per month and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. She had been a teacher and had later worked in business with her husband until his death. A brother in his 60s had Parkinsons disease, and a sister in her 80s had Parkinsons disease and dementia. Her six children and her grandchildren were healthy. On examination, the patient was alert, attentive, well-groomed, cooperative, and pleasant. The blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg, the pulse 78 beats per minute and regular, and the weight 68.6 kg. She had a score on the MiniMental State Examination of 28 with scores ranging from 0 to 30 and higher scores indicating better cognitive function, because she was unable to recall the name of the hospital or the county. She had a score on the Clinical Dementia Rating scale of 0 with scores ranging from 0 to 3 and lower scores indicating better cognitive function. The neurologic examination was normal, including evaluation of the 2nd through 12th cranial nerves, power, bulk, tone, coordination, stance, and gait; the deep tendon reflexes were 1 throughout. The platelet count was 362,000 per cubic millimeter reference range, 150,000 to 350,000, and the folate level was 20 ng per milliliter 45 nmol per liter; reference range, 3 to 17 ng per milliliter 7 to 39 nmol per liter. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, white-cell count, and blood levels of vitamin B12, electrolytes, glucose, calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of renal- and liver-function tests. A rapid plasma reagin test was nonreactive, and testing for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi was negative. As part of the standard evaluation for a suspected cognitive impairment, the patient was referred for neuropsychological testing, speech pathological evaluation, and imaging studies of the head. Dr. Janet C. Sherman: On neuropsychological testing, the patients performance on a screen of nonverbal abilities indicated that she had average pre-morbid intellectual abilities. Language impairment was evident both through clinical observations and when she performed verbal tasks, including tasks of confrontation naming, verbal fluency for which she had substantially more difficulty with semantic fluency than with phonemic fluency, verbal abstraction, and comprehension of individual words. Her spontaneous speech was fluent, but she had notable difficulty with word finding and made occasional paraphasic errors. She often had difficulty comprehending words, such as cork, misplaced, bored, and pessimism. Her performance on tests of attention and executive functioning varied; her greatest impairments were evident when the tasks required language mediation, and these impairments contrasted with her generally normal performance on tasks that were not verbally mediated. Similarly, her performance was normal on a test of nonverbal memory but was substantially impaired on a test of verbal memory. Her storage of verbal information was difficult to assess because of her impaired acquisition and anomia. Her storage of nonverbal information was normal, as was her performance on visuospatial tasks. She did not report symptoms of depression or anxiety on self-reported assessments. Ms. Daisy Hochberg: Speech pathological evaluation revealed that the patient had fluent, articulate speech with pauses for word finding, vague word substitutions, and circumlocutions. She was somewhat tangential in her speech and was fixated on telling stories from her life, such that she required frequent refocusing on the topic at hand. She had substantial impairment on a test of naming, with superordinate responses, and she had impairment on wordpicture matching. Rare phonemic paraphasias were present. Auditory comprehension was impaired for words she no longer recognized and for sentences with complex syntax. Sentence repetition was intact. A written language assessment revealed that she could read normally and had mild agrammatism in written language samples. A semantic picturepicture matching test revealed no evidence of visual agnosia. A portion of the speech pathological evaluation is shown in Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Carolyn A. Boscia Medicine and Pediatrics: An 18-year-old woman was seen in the emergency department of this hospital 11 weeks after the birth of her first child because of acute liver failure. The patient had been well until 1 week before this presentation, when rhinor-rhea, sore throat, and cough developed. On the fourth day of illness, she was seen in an urgent care clinic because of worsening cough, wheezing, and dyspnea. Bronchitis was diagnosed, and promethazinedextromethorphan syrup and a 5-day course of oral azithromycin were prescribed. The patient returned home. Over the next 3 days, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and vaginal bleeding developed. The patient also noted progressive yellowing of her skin and eyes. When she woke up on the morning of the current presentation, she felt light-headed. When she arose from bed, syncope occurred; the patient fell and had a laceration of the chin. Her boyfriend called emergency medical services EMS, and a team was dispatched to the patients home. On assessment by EMS personnel, the patient had jaundice and diaphoresis. She appeared fatigued. The pulse was 120 beats per minute, the blood pressure 82/56 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while she was breathing ambient air. Nystagmus occurred on right lateral gaze. The abdomen was distended, and tenderness was present in the right lower quadrant. The capillary blood glucose level was 121 mg per deciliter 6.7 mmol per liter, and an electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Intravenous fluids and supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute were administered, and the patient was transported to the emergency department of another hospital. On arrival at the other hospital, the patient reported burning abdominal pain, which she rated at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The temperature was 37.0C, the pulse 88 beats per minute, the blood pres-sure 107/42 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while she was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft, with tenderness on the right side, and there was trace edema of the legs. The results of the examination were otherwise unchanged. The blood carbon dioxide level was 21 mmol per liter reference range, 24 to 34, and the blood glucose level was 104 mg per deciliter 5.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 100 mg per deciliter 3.9 to 5.6 mmol per liter. The anion gap and blood levels of sodium, potassium, and chloride were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests and a serum toxicology screen, which included a test for acetaminophen. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Amir H. Davarpanah: A chest radiograph and a computed tomographic CT scan of the head obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material were normal. Ultrasonog-raphy of the abdomen revealed mildly increased hepatic parenchymal echogenicity Fig. 1A. This finding, although nonspecific, could reflect hepatic steatosis or diffuse parenchymal disease. No focal liver lesions were identified. The gallbladder was distended, with apparent wall edema, a small amount of pericholecystic fluid, and layering sludge Fig. 1B. The common bile duct was normal in diameter, with no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation Fig. 1C. The spleen was mildly enlarged, to a greatest longitudinal diameter of 13 cm normal, 12. Dr. Boscia: Intravenous fluids, piperacillintazo-bactam, morphine, ondansetron, and N-acetyl-cysteine were administered, and packed red cells were transfused. Five hours after arrival at the other hospital, the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient reported that the abdominal pain and light-headed-ness had resolved and the nausea had decreased. She recalled that during the past several days, her gums had bled easily when she brushed her teeth and her urine had been tea-colored. She had a history of mild asthma. Eleven weeks earlier, she had given birth to her first child; after an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy, preterm labor developed and was complicated by placental abruption, and vaginal delivery occurred at 32 weeks of gestation. The patient reported that she had remained in the hospital for 1 week af-ter delivery because of unspecified abnormal laboratory test results. Her medications were albuterol as needed, azithromycin, and prometha-zinedextromethorphan syrup; she did not take herbal remedies or supplements and had no known allergies. Immunizations were reportedly current. Six weeks before this presentation, the patient had moved to an urban area of New England where she currently lived with her daughter, boyfriend, and boyfriends parents. She was of Southeast Asian descent and had been born in the United States. She did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. A grandmother had unspecified liver disease. On examination, the patient appeared tired and had marked jaundice. The temperature was 37.6C, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the blood pressure 100/58 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while she was breathing ambient air. Con-junctival icterus was present. The abdomen was soft, with mild epigastric tenderness; abdominal guarding, rebound tenderness, and Murphys sign were absent. There was a 1.5-cm laceration on the chin. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed smudge cells, burr cells, basophilic stippling, rouleaux formation, dysplas-tic neutrophils, and 1 polychromasia. The anion gap, venous blood-gas measurements, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, magnesium, glucose, amylase, lipase, and fibrinogen; additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing for urinary human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. A serum toxicology screen was negative, and a urine toxicology screen was positive for opiates and negative for all other analytes. Urinalysis revealed slightly cloudy, amber-colored urine with a specific gravity of 1.019, a pH of 6.0, 2 bili-rubin, 2 urobilinogen, and 1 occult blood by dipstick; there were 0 to 2 white cells and 0 to 2 red cells per high-power field. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Dr. Davarpanah: Doppler ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed persistent evidence of wall edema and intraluminal sludge in the gallbladder. Murphys sign was absent, although this finding was not reliable because of the prior administration of analgesic agents. Pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography revealed normal arterial flow in the main hepatic artery (Figure 1D). There was also normal hepatopetal flow in the portal veins (Figure 1E) and hepatofugal flow in the hepatic veins (Figure 1F). Dr. Boscia: The administration of N-acetylcysteine was continued, and the chin laceration was sutured. Additional laboratory tests were performed, and a diagnosis was made.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. L. Nicolas Gonzalez Castro Neurology: A 62-year-old man with sarcoidosis and heart disease was admitted to this hospital because of new-onset diplopia and weakness. The patient was in his usual health until approximately 2 weeks before admission, when nausea, dizziness, tinnitus, and unsteady gait developed; these symptoms were associated with subjective fevers. Five days before admission, a diagnosis of respiratory infection with inner-ear symptoms was made; the symptoms decreased transiently. Three days before admission, the patient awoke at 4 a.m. and noted diminished muscle control, which was more severe in the arms than in the legs, and shaking in the hands. Reaching for his eyeglasses required intense concentration and slowing of reaching movements. He had difficulty rising and was unable to walk. He was admitted to another hospital, where sequential examinations revealed fluctuating arm weakness and dysarthria, which sometimes lessened with repeated testing. The complete blood count, white-cell differential count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and C-reactive protein; results of tests of renal and liver function were also reportedly normal. A chest radiograph reportedly showed small, bilateral pleural effusions, with no consolidation or pneumothorax. Results of computed tomography CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, and CT angiography of the head and neck were reportedly normal. Cerebrospinal fluid CSF obtained by lumbar puncture contained 4 red cells and 188 white cells per cubic millimeter, with 88 lymphocytes, 5 segmented neutrophils, and 7 monocytes. Other test results were pending. Results of electromyography were reportedly normal. Antibiotic agents and prednisone were administered. During the hospitalization, horizontal diplopia developed, which disappeared when one eye was covered. On the third evening, sweats and chills occurred. The next day, he was transferred to this hospital. On admission, the patient reported diplopia, tremors that were more pronounced in his arms than in his legs and that worsened when he used those limbs, increased urinary frequency, night sweats, and chills, with no numbness, tingling, pain, headaches, neck stiffness, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or rashes. He had had worsening heart failure during the previous 4 years, and a diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis had been made 16 months before admission, after evaluation by positron-emission tomography PET and CT of the chest had revealed increased, high 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in lymph nodes of the chest and abdomen. Pathological examination of tissue obtained by means of medi-astinoscopy had reportedly revealed confluent, nonnecrotizing granulomas with extensive hyalin-ization; silver and acid-fast staining had shown no organisms. A 4-month course of prednisone was administered between 16 months and 12 months before this admission. Four months before this admission, a 4-month course of pred-nisone and methotrexate was begun and was completed shortly before the onset of symptoms. The patient also had hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease with stent placement, congestive heart failure, complete heart block, ventricular arrhythmias for which an automatic implantable cardioverterdefibrillator had been implanted, mild asthma associated with allergies which he had had since childhood, allergic rhinitis, and recent dental surgery, for which he had received unknown antibiotics for a period of 7 days. Medications were cholecalciferol, doxazosin, atorvas-tatin, sotalol, low-dose aspirin, folic acid, a multivitamin, fluticasone by inhalation, enoxaparin subcutaneously, and, as needed, ipratropium by inhalation and nitroglycerin sublingually. He had received that years seasonal influenza vaccine. He lived with his wife and worked in an office. He did not drink alcohol, smoke, or use illicit drugs. His mother was more than 90 years of age and had a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which was being treated with prednisone; his father had had a stroke, and his siblings were healthy. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented. The temperature was 36.2C, the blood pressure 93/53 mm Hg, the pulse 75 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93 while the patient was breathing ambient air. He had subtle deficits in episodic memory, including difficulty in recounting elements of his own recent medi-cal history. The pupils were round and reactive to light, constricting from 3 mm in diameter to 2 mm. Extraocular movements were full, without nystagmus or saccadic breakdown. He had horizontal diplopia in all directions, with mild ptosis of the right eyelid. Tremors of the cheeks occurred on smiling, and the patient was unable to puff out his cheeks. Other cranial-nerve examinations were normal; however, the first cranial nerve was not tested. Motor examination revealed myoclonus of the arms, with no fasciculation or cogwheel rigidity. Strength was rated 4 out of 5 in the fingers on the left hand with extension and was otherwise rated 5 out of 5. Light-touch sensation was preserved throughout. The deep-tendon reflexes were rated 1 and were symmetric at the triceps, biceps, brachioradialis, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, and soleus. Plantar responses were mute on both feet. There was prominent arm-shaking on finger-to-nose testing when the patients eyes were open; the shaking was less pronounced when his eyes were closed. Rapid alternating movements were normal, as were the results of heel-to-shin testing and mirroring testing. Gait and stance were not tested. Blood levels of troponin T were normal, as were results of urine analysis and renal function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Blood and urine cultures were obtained. One dose of cefepime was administered, followed by ceftri-axone, vancomycin, and ampicillin, and cardiac and bronchodilator medications. During the first hospital day, nausea and vomiting occurred, and the temperature rose to 38.8C. Sequential neurologic examinations initially revealed increased somnolence, decreased orientation and ability to be aroused, slow verbal responses with dysfluent speech, and no evidence of dysarthria or dysphagia. Diplopia, right-eyelid ptosis, and coarse omnidirectional nystagmus in the primary position i.e., when the patient was looking forward were present, with no nuchal rigidity. Cytologic examination of CSF obtained by means of lumbar puncture revealed an increased number of lymphocytes and background proteinaceous debris; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Grams staining of a sputum specimen showed no leukocytes, a moderate number of squamous epithelial cells, and mixed flora; sputum cultures grew very few enteric gram-negative rods, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus, and normal flora. Blood and urine cultures remained sterile. The temperature rose to 40.1C. Acyclovir was added on the second hospital day. On the third hospital day, gluco-corticoids were begun for hypotension. On the fourth hospital day, hyponatremia and progressive generalized weakness occurred, and fevers continued. Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: CT images of the head on the fourth hospital day, obtained before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were normal for the patients age Fig. 1A. Dr. Gonzalez Castro: Indirect immunofluorescence testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies was negative. Portable electroencephalography revealed generalized rhythmic delta activity and bifrontal triphasic waves, with diffuse irregular deltatheta slowing. Lorazepam was administered, which resulted in improvement in generalized rhythmic delta activity but not in mental status. On the fifth hospital day, somnolence increased and mental status worsened. Cytologic examination of CSF obtained by means of a repeat lumbar puncture showed an increased number of lymphocytes with admixed neutrophils, macrophages, and occasional plasma cells, and no evidence of malignant cells; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Pressors for hypotension were administered intravenously; morphine sulfate and propofol were administered, the trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation begun. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. The next day, blood levels of thyrotropin, vitamin B12, folate, and cortisol were normal, as were results of liver function tests; testing for 1,3-beta-d-glucan was negative. Methylprednisolone and amiodarone were begun, and sotalol was stopped. Liposomal amphotericin was administered for 2 days. On the seventh hospital day, levetiracetam was begun. The next day, the level of N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide was 8227 pg per milliliter reference range, 0 to 900, and tropo-nin T levels remained low. On the ninth hospital day, another lumbar puncture was performed, and the CSF was analyzed Table 1. Later that evening, the pupils became nonreactive. Neuro-surgical consultation was obtained, and additional imaging studies were performed. Dr. Gonzalez: Contrast-enhanced CT of the head revealed new, extensive hypoattenuation in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, sulcal effacement, and marked expansion of the corpus callosum, which indicated brain swelling and edema. Leptomeningeal enhancement was also present Fig. 1B. Dr. Gonzalez Castro: Immune globulin was transfused. On the 10th hospital day, the pupils measured 6 mm in diameter and were nonreactive. The corneal reflexes were stronger in the right eye than in the left; there was very weak movement of the legs and no arm movement on stimulation. Mannitol was administered. An additional repeat brain imaging study was performed. Dr. Gonzalez: CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, showed interval progression of diffuse cerebral swelling, with new, diffuse hemispheric sulcal effacement and development of descending trans-tentorial herniation Fig. 1C. Dr. Gonzalez Castro: After consultation with the patients family, comfort measures were instituted, and the patient died later that day. An autopsy was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Amebic meningoencephalitis caused by A. cul­bertsoni. ", "prediction": "1.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Megan P. Lambert Pediatrics: A 2-month-old girl was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit ICU of this hospital because of respiratory failure, growth retardation, and failure to thrive. The patient was born by vaginal delivery to a primigravida mother at another hospital after 39 weeks of gestation; labor was induced because of intrauterine growth retardation. The birth weight was 2.3 kg first percentile, and Apgar scores were 6 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The umbilical cord was two-vessel. The patient was admitted to the neonatal ICU. Perinatal examination reportedly revealed natal teeth, retrognathia, and global hypotonia. Laboratory testing showed hypoglycemia and thrombocytopenia, which resolved. Jaundice was present; a Coombs test was negative, and the patient was treated with phototherapy. No weight gain was noted during her hospitalization. She was discharged from the ICU on the 10th hospital day. At 30 days of life, the patient was seen in the outpatient genetics clinic of the other hospital. On examination, she was reportedly in respiratory distress, with an oxygen saturation between 70 and 79 while she was breathing ambient air, and she was transferred to the ICU. Dr. Sjirk J. Westra: A chest radiograph Fig. 1A and computed tomography CT of the chest and abdomen, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed borderline cardiomegaly, nonspecific diffuse pulmonary abnormalities, and architectural distortion of the lung parenchyma that was reminiscent of chronic lung disease of prematurity. However, since the baby was not born prematurely and was not receiving ventilatory support as a neonate but was small for gestational age, the term WilsonMikity syndrome pulmonary dysmaturity syndrome1 may be applied to describe the radiographic findings. An esophagram was normal, revealing no evidence suggestive of a vascular ring or vascular sling. Dr. Lambert: A diagnosis of hypercarbic respiratory failure of an unknown cause was made. The patient was transferred to a second hospital. Dr. Westra: Twenty-seven days before this admission, magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head Fig. 2, performed at the second hospital, revealed extensive periventricular gray-matter het-erotopia, a large cisterna magna, and microgna-thia, with no evidence of intracranial venous thrombosis. Dr. Manuella Lahoud-Rahme: Transthoracic echo-cardiography revealed a patent foramen ovale, a large perimembranous ventricular septal defect walled off by an aneurysmal membranous septum, and an effective small left-to-right shunt without left ventricular dilatation. There was also a competent bicuspid aortic valve with fusion of the intercoronary commissure, with trivial stenosis, aortic dilatation, and a large patent ductus arterio-sus with bidirectional flow and pulmonary arterial pressures estimated to be at systemic levels, as well as preserved biventricular function. Dr. Lambert: Genetics consultation was obtained, and results of microarray testing GeneDx were reportedly normal. The patient was discharged on the sixth hospital day, but she returned within 12 hours, after an episode of severe respiratory distress. A brief episode of bradycardia was observed in the pediatric department, and she was transferred to the pediatric ICU. Twenty days before admission to this hospital, an orogastric feeding tube was placed because of weight loss. Dr. Westra: Three days later, CT angiography of the chest Fig. 1B through 1E revealed dilatation of the ascending aorta, a large patent ductus arteriosus with a relatively small-caliber transverse aortic arch and no focal coarctation, an enlarged pulmonary-artery trunk 1.6 cm in diameter, enlarged left and right main pulmonary arteries indicative of pulmonary hypertension, and large lung volumes. Scattered bandlike and ground-glass opacities and areas of hyperaeration were seen in both lungs. Dr. Lahoud-Rahme: Nine days before this admission, when the patient was 7 weeks 3 days of age, cardiac catheterization was performed, and the patent ductus arteriosus was closed with the use of a 6-mm Amplatzer Vascular Plug II device. The pulmonary arterial pressure was 51/23 mm Hg mean, 35, and the aortic pressure 53/24 mm Hg mean, 36. There was no substantial change in the pulmonary arterial pressure after the ductus was closed pulmonary arterial pressure, 58/19 mm Hg mean, 36; aortic pressure, 89/56 mm Hg mean, 67 or when the patient received supplemental oxygen with a fraction of inspired oxygen Fio2 of 1.0 pulmonary arterial pressure, 58/19 mm Hg mean, 36; aortic pressure, 89/56 mm Hg mean, 67. Dr. Lambert: The patient was transferred back to the first hospital, which was closer to her home. Despite closure of the patent ductus arteriosus, the patients respiratory status did not improve, and she required continuous positive airway pressure CPAP with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 6 cm of water. The patients interest in oral feedings decreased and continuous nasogastric tube feedings were begun, but no appreciable weight gain was noted. There was no evidence of inability to feed or of abnormalities on an esoph-agram. She was transferred to the pediatric ICU of this hospital. Medications on transfer were famoti-dine, furosemide, metoclopramide, and as needed simethicone for gastric distress and a glycerine suppository for constipation; she also received continuous nasogastric feeding with formula. The patient lived with her parents and maternal relatives. Her mother had smoked during pregnancy, had taken lamotrigine for a seizure disorder that had been diagnosed when she was a teenager, and had hyperflexible joints. She and the patients maternal grandmother had periventricular hetero-topia. A maternal half-aunt also had a seizure disorder. The patients father had a history of depression; two paternal half-sisters were healthy. The patients mother was of European ancestry; her father was of French and Polish ancestry. On examination, the patients weight was 3.18 kg below the first percentile for age, the length 48.25 cm, and the head circumference 37 cm. The maximal temperature was 37.2C; the systemic systolic blood pressure ranged from 79 to 96 mm Hg, the diastolic blood pressure from 46 to 57 mm Hg mean arterial pressure, 50 to 60 mm Hg, the heart rate from 120 to 140 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate from 20 to 50 breaths per minute. The sutures were open, and the facial appearance was not dysmorphic. The hair of the scalp and eyebrows was thin, and a natal tooth was present. The eyes were widely spaced, with greyblue sclera. There were bilateral fine crackles in the lungs with more crackles in the right lung than in the left, with mild sub-costal and suprasternal retractions; no associated stridor, wheezing, grunting, or nasal flaring was present. No cardiac murmur was heard. The abdomen was soft, with bowel sounds. Muscle tone was poor, and there was poor visual tracking of a toy. When the patient was asleep, the oxygen saturation decreased to between 80 and 89% while she was receiving CPAP with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 6 cm of water through nasal prongs. As she continued to receive CPAP, the Fio2 increased to 0.4 and the oxygen saturation rose to greater than 95%. The next day, an electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 153 beats per minute and was normal for the patient’s age. Dr. Lahoud-Rahme: On the patient’s arrival at this hospital, we performed repeat transthoracic echocardiography, which showed the findings reported earlier: the presence of a well-situated ductal occluder device, no coarctation, no residual ductal-level shunting, and normal biventricular size and function. The effective shunting across the ventricular septal defect was small (peak interventricular gradient, 40 mm Hg), with estimated right ventricular pressures at 50% of systemic levels. Interventricular septal flattening was present, which was suggestive of at least mildly elevated pulmonary arterial pressures. Dr. Lambert: Blood levels of glucose, urea nitrogen, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.Dr. Lahoud-Rahme: Cardiac catheterization was performed 15 days after admission. Baseline data were obtained when the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen with an Fio2 of 0.4. The oxygen saturation was 69% in the superior vena cava and 79% in the left pulmonary artery; these findings are indicative of insubstantial left-to-right shunting (hemoglobin level, 11 g per deciliter; assumed oxygen consumption, 170 ml per minute per square meter of body-surface area; ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow, 1.25:1). The mean right atrial pressure was 3 mm Hg, the right ventricular pressure 44//4 mm Hg, the pulmonary arterial pressure 36//12 mm Hg (mean, 22), the aortic pressure 63//41 mm Hg (mean, 51), the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 5 mm Hg, and the left ventricular pressure 70//6 mm Hg. Using these data, we estimated a normal systemic vascular resistance at 16 Wood units per square meter (normal range, 9 to 20) and a pulmonary vascular resistance at 3 Wood units per square meter (normal range, 0.25 to 3). Wood units, which are used by pediatric cardiologists to measure vascular resistance, are calculated by dividing the relevant pressure (in mm Hg) by cardiac output (in liters per minute). The cardiac index was 4.4 liters per minute per square meter. After the patient received supplemental oxygen with an Fio2 of 1.0 for 10 minutes, the pulmonary arterial pressure was 28//10 mm Hg (mean, 17) and the aortic pressure was 55//36 mm Hg (mean, 44); the pulmonary vascular resistance was calculated at 2 Wood units per square meter. After the patient received inhaled nitric oxide at a concentration of 80 parts per million with an Fio2 of 1.0 for 10 minutes, the pulmonary arterial pressure was 27//9 mm Hg (mean, 15), the aortic pressure 58//41 mm Hg (mean, 48), and the pulmonary vascular resistance 2 Wood units per square meter. The pressure measurements did not indicate pulmonary arterial hypertension. Selective angiograms of the pulmonary arterial branch (Videos 1, 2, and 3, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) showed abnormal tortuous distal pulmonary arterial vasculature with no evidence of emboli or obstruction. The pulmonary venous return was unobstructed. Diagnostic procedures were performed, and additional test results were received from the other hospitals.

Computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material Fig. 2, revealed a well-circumscribed, solid retroperitoneal mass 2.8 cm by 3.3 cm by 4.6 cm at the level of the pelvic inlet on the right side, anterior and medial to the psoas muscle and anterior to the right common iliac artery. The mass was solitary and had homogeneous contrast enhancement. There was a 4-mm nodule at the base of the right lung that was indeterminate. Subsequent CT and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose FDG positron-emission tomography PET Fig. 3A and 3B confirmed the presence of the well-circumscribed mass near the right psoas muscle. FDG avidity was within physiologic limits, and there was no evidence of pathologic uptake. No evidence of other pathologic conditions, upper-tract filling defects, or bladder lesions was present. There was no abnormal FDG uptake in the nodule of the right lung. Dr. Cheng: The patient was referred to the urology outpatient clinic of this hospital. He had had excessive bleeding after a tonsillectomy and an adenoidectomy in his youth but had no subsequent bleeding during dental procedures or while he was brushing his teeth; he was otherwise in excellent health. He was physically active, with activities including running and playing soccer. He took no medications and had no known allergies. He lived in an urban area in South America and was a student. His mother had multiple sclerosis, a brother had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, his paternal grandfather had died of heart disease, and his father and other siblings and grandparents were healthy. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs, and he was not sexually active. On examination, the abdomen was soft and the mass was barely palpable; there was no regional lymphadenopathy, pain, or discomfort. The remainder of the examination, including a genital examination, was normal. The white-cell count was 3300 per cubic millimeter reference range, 4500 to 11,000, and the remainder of the complete blood count, a urinalysis, and results of coagulation and renal-function tests were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG), and alpha-fetoprotein.Dr. Cronin: Ultrasonography of the scrotum, performed at the time of the evaluation in the urology outpatient clinic of this hospital, revealed normal testes and epididymides and no change in the size of the solid retroperitoneal mass.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Kevin J. Heaton Medicine: A 57-year-old woman was seen in the outpatient rheu-matology clinic of this hospital because of fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, headache, diffuse abdominal pain, and skin lesions. The patient had been well until approximately 24 months before this evaluation, when a dry, nonproductive cough developed. Results of laboratory testing, which was performed at another hospital, are shown in Table 1. Twenty-one months before this evaluation, when the patient was seen by her physician at another clinic, she reported persistent cough, decreased appetite, and moderate but poorly localized abdominal pain. On examination, her weight was 108.9 kg decreased from her baseline weight of 122.5 kg 5 months earlier. A proton-pump inhibitor was administered. During the following month, fatigue and myalgias occurred, followed by the appearance of painless red dots around her ankles. Evaluation of a skin-biopsy specimen reportedly revealed findings consistent with early pigmented purpuric dermatosis. Blood tests revealed peripheral eosinophilia. Twenty months before this evaluation, the patient was seen at the other hospital because of persistent cough; laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was reportedly normal. Computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed mild, diffuse bronchial-wall thickening, a finding suggestive of chronic inflammation. Mildly enlarged lymph nodes were present in the paracardiac region, porta hepatis, mesentery, and retroperitoneum. During the following year, multiple evaluations by consultants in allergy, rheu-matology, hematologyoncology, endocrinology, and gastroenterology were performed. Nineteen months before this evaluation, esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, and pathological examination of biopsy specimens from the gastric antrum revealed mild chronic and focally active gastritis. Immunohistochemical staining for Helicobacter pylori was negative, and the small-bowel villi were normal. Dr. Amita Sharma: Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen, performed at the other hospital 18 months before this evaluation, revealed enlarged periportal lymph nodes. No focal lesions were seen in the liver, pancreas, kidneys, spleen, or adrenal glands. There was mild splenomegaly. The pancreas was not enlarged. Sixteen months before this evaluation, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed mild bronchial-wall thickening, lymph-adenopathy in the axillae with the largest node, in the right axilla, measuring 2.3 cm by 1.3 cm, an enlarged right epicardial lymph node measuring 1.5 cm by 1.1 cm, and enlarged nodes in the portacaval, peripancreatic, and mesenteric regions with the largest node, in the porta hepatis, measuring 4.2 cm by 2.9 cm. Dr. Heaton: One month later, pathological examination of a right axillary lymph node revealed preserved architecture. Follicular and paracortical hyperplasia was present, along with a polytypic plasmacytosis. Immunostaining for human her-pesvirus 8 HHV-8 DNA was negative. The findings were consistent with reactive lymphade-nopathy; no evidence of hematologic cancer was identified. Therapeutic trials of oral metoclo-pramide, cetirizine, omeprazole, and budesonide; fluticasone nasal spray; and inhaled fluticasone salmeterol resulted in no improvement. The patient continued to lose weight. Dr. Sharma: Thirteen months before this evaluation, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose FDG positron-emission tomography PET, performed at the other hospital, revealed FDG-avid lymph nodes in the axillae, the paracardial region, and the region of the right internal thoracic artery. The liver and spleen were enlarged and showed diffuse FDG uptake. Dr. Heaton: Examination of a bone marrow biopsy specimen and bone marrow aspirate revealed hypercellular bone marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis, increased eosinophils, megakaryocytes, and polyclonal plasma cells, findings that are consistent with a reactive process. Biopsy of the liver was performed to investigate the hepatosplenomegaly and the FDG uptake in the liver and spleen. Pathological examination of a core needlebiopsy specimen of the liver revealed moderate-to-severe portal, periportal, and lobular inflammation that was predominantly composed of plasma cells with polytypic expression of kappa and lambda light chains on immunohistochemi-cal staining, with occasional eosinophils. Bile-duct proliferation, focal damage, intraepithelial lymphocytes, and scattered apoptotic hepatocytes were seen, and trichrome staining highlighted the presence of sinusoidal fibrosis. A stain for iron deposition was negative. The findings were thought to be consistent with an overlap syndrome of autoimmune hepatitis and focal sclerosing cholangi-tis. Treatment with prednisone was begun but was discontinued by the patient for unspecified reasons. Azathioprine therapy was also begun at this time. A decrease in abdominal pain and fatigue was reported. Dr. Sharma: Seven months before this evaluation, an FDG-PET examination with CT for attenuation correction was performed at the other hospital Fig. 1. Splenomegaly was present, and stably enlarged FDG-avid lymph nodes were seen in the axillae, the region of the internal thoracic artery, the right paracardiac region, and the retro-peritoneal, iliac, and inguinal regions. There was no hilar lymphadenopathy. There was diffuse, mild, smooth bronchial-wall thickening. No pulmonary nodules or air-space opacities were present. Dr. Heaton: One month later, an inguinal lymph node was excised. Pathological examination revealed follicular hyperplasia and a polytypic plas-macytosis of the medulla and sinusoidal regions. On immunohistochemical studies for IgG and IgG4, a small fraction of the plasma cells were immunoreactive for IgG4. Four months before this evaluation, the patient was evaluated for a nonproductive cough, severe fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, joint pain, diffuse aches, swelling of the right knee, and night sweats. Further weight loss to 88.5 kg from her baseline weight of 122.5 kg was noted. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Two months before this evaluation, severe and increasing bitemporal headache developed. The patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. On evaluation at this hospital, the patient reported daily headaches and pain in her jaw when she chewed food. She did not report dry eyes or dry mouth. She had hypertension, anemia, and chronic left-knee pain after an injury that had occurred 6 years previously; she had undergone a hysterectomy and trigger-finger release. A tuberculin skin test that had been performed 2.5 years earlier was negative. Medications included budesonide, azathioprine, omeprazole, metoclo-pramide, and losartan. Naproxen caused a rash; she had no other known allergies or history of atopy. She was from the Caribbean, lived in a city in New England, and worked in a health-related field. She drank alcohol sparingly and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her mother had diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and her father had had colon cancer when he was 70 years of age. A daughter had systemic lupus erythematosus; her other three children and five siblings were healthy. On examination, the temperature was 35.1C, the blood pressure 178/96 mm Hg, the pulse 114 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 165 cm, the weight 87.5 kg, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 32.1. The upper eyelids were prominent, and the lacrimal glands were swollen bilaterally Fig. 2A. The temporal arteries were swollen, indurated, and nodular bilaterally, with strong pulses and no tenderness Fig. 2B. The sublingual glands were hypertrophic bilaterally. A nontender lymph node, measuring 1 cm in greatest dimension, was pres-ent in the posterior cervical chain. Abdominal examination revealed mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant and a palpable spleen tip. Warm synovial effusions were present in the right knee and left ankle. The left ankle was tender, and there were areas of palpable and nonpalpable purpura on both legs Fig. 2C. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, and alkaline phosphatase and results of renal-function tests were normal. Tests for hepatitis C virus HCV antibodies and hepatitis B virus core antibodies were negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "IgG4-related vasculitis.", "prediction": "1. **Sarcoidosis**: The diffuse systemic involvement, including enlarged lymph nodes, hepatosplenomegaly, and pulmonary manifestations, are consistent with sarcoidosis.\n2. **Lymphoma**: FDG-avid lymph nodes, significant weight loss, and systemic symptoms like night sweats and fatigue are classic findings for lymphoma.\n3. **Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia (or Hypereosinophilic Syndrome)**: Persistent eosinophilia with multi-organ involvement, including the lung, liver, and gastrointestinal tract.\n4. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: The patient has constitutional symptoms, biopsy findings of polytypic plasmacytosis, and a family history of SLE, suggesting a systemic autoimmune process.\n5. **IgG4-related Disease**: The biopsy revealing IgG4-positive plasma cells, along with multi-organ involvement, suggests an IgG4-related systemic disease.\n6. **Tuberculosis (TB)**: Though the tuberculin skin test was negative, latent TB infection can present with systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy, especially in an immunocompromised state.\n7. **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)**: The combination of lung involvement, sinus issues, and constitutional symptoms might indicate GPA.\n8. **Castleman Disease**: Multicentric Castleman Disease often presents with systemic symptoms, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and plasmacytosis in histology.\n9. **Adult-onset Still's Disease**: Systemic symptoms with weight loss, arthralgia, and systemic lymphadenopathy could be indicative of this rare inflammatory disorder.\n10. **Infectious Mononucleosis or Chronic EBV infection**: Chronic Epstein-Barr virus infection can present with systemic symptoms, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and persistent fatigue."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Jeffrey L. Greenwald: A 73-year-old man with multiple chronic medical illnesses was admitted to this hospital because of confusion and irritability. Two days before this admission, increasing weakness, lethargy, chills, and diarrhea developed. The patient became less responsive to his family and increasingly irritable and confused. He stopped taking his medications. On the day of admission, his oral intake was 500 ml of liquid. His family reported that he was in an almost catatonic state; he was unable to arise from bed, had recurrent epistaxis, and reported pain in his chest and left arm. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient had been in poor health, with a recent diagnosis of atypical pneumonia, which was treated with levofloxacin. He had a history of diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac evaluations that had been performed over the previous decade had revealed an exudative pericardial effusion that had spontaneously resolved, as well as heart failure predominantly on the right side left ventricular ejection fraction, 69; pulmonary arterial systolic pressure, 61 mm Hg. A biopsy of the right side of the heart did not reveal a cause of the heart failure. The patient had had recurrent epistaxis since childhood, and it had recently worsened. Additional medical history included hyperlipidemia, pancytopenia, obstructive sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and headaches; there was also a possible history of an arteriovenous malformation of the brain, which had been noted on an imaging study obtained 20 years earlier but had not been confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging MRI performed at this hospital 7 years before this admission. He had undergone excision of a basal-cell carcinoma and an appendectomy. One month before this admission, the patient had been admitted to this hospital because of acute confusion and worsening edema. During that admission, ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant was performed. Dr. Shaunagh McDermott: An image of the right lower lobe of the liver showed a communication between the right portal vein and the right hepatic vein, a finding consistent with a hepatic venovenous malformation with portosystemic shunting Fig. 1. Dr. Greenwald: A diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy was made. The confusion improved after the initiation of treatment with lactulose and rifaximin. On the current admission, medications included warfarin, metoprolol, simvastatin, furosemide, spironolactone, potassium chloride, lactulose, rifaximin, ferrous sulfate, glipizide, metformin, omeprazole, and, owing to enrollment in a clinical trial investigating therapies for pulmonary hypertension, either sildenafil or placebo. The patient had had adverse reactions to azithromy-cin, lansoprazole, and metolazone. He lived with his wife and was retired from a position in higher education. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His parents had died when they were in their 70s; his father had had heart disease, and his mother had had a stroke. His mother and his daughter had a history of recurrent epistaxis and of easy bleeding. On examination, the patient was somnolent but easily roused by vocal stimulation. He was oriented and cooperative, with waxing and waning attention, and he was uncertain about why he was in the hospital. The temperature was 37.4C, the blood pressure 141/61 mm Hg, the pulse 103 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while he was breathing ambient air. The mucous membranes were dry, and dried blood was noted around the nares. There were multiple telangiec-tasias on the face, lips, and torso, and there were nonblanching cherry angiomas on the chest. The heart sounds were irregularly irregular; the first and second sounds were otherwise normal. The lungs were clear bilaterally. There was mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant, with no rebound or guarding. Bowel sounds were present. There was no abdominal distention, and the edge of the liver was palpable 2 cm below the right costal margin. Testing for Murphys sign was negative. No rectal masses were detected on palpation; the stool was brown, with trace blood. There was no asterixis. The legs were dark and discolored, a finding consistent with chronic venous insufficiency. The remainder of the general and neurologic examinations was normal. Blood levels of total and direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, globulin, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, amylase, lipase, and lactic acid were normal, as were levels of vitamin B12 and folate, which had been obtained 1 week earlier; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed clear yellow fluid, with a specific gravity of 1.020, a pH of 5.5, and trace blood; the urine sediment showed 0 to 2 white cells and 0 to 2 red cells per high-power field, 20 to 100 hyaline casts and 0 to 2 granular casts per low-power field, and mucin. Screening of the urine for toxins was negative. An electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation, frequent premature ventricular contractions, ST-segment depression of at least 1 mm in leads II, III, and aVF, and downsloping ST-segment depression of 2 mm in lead V6. Dr. McDermott: A radiograph of the chest showed evidence of persistent interstitial edema and focal opacities in both lower lobes; these findings could represent alveolar edema, superimposed pneumonia, or aspiration. Computed tomography CT of the abdomen, performed with the administration of oral contrast material, revealed nonspecific pneumatosis of the ascending colon to the level of the hepatic flexure, without associated portal venous gas or other inflammatory changes. Cholelithiasis, atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and mesenteric vessels, and cardiomegaly were also present Fig. 2. Dr. Greenwald: Intravenous normal saline, van-comycin, cefepime, and oral potassium chloride were administered, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. On his arrival in the inpatient unit, the dose of rifaximin was increased, warfa-rin and furosemide were discontinued, and lac-tulose and other outpatient medications were resumed. On evaluation the next morning, approximately 12 hours after his presentation, the patient was less confused. Diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Hepatic encephalopathy in a patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. ", "prediction": "\n1.

Tariro Makadzange: A 39-year-old man was admitted to a large, urban tertiary-care hospital in Zimbabwe where a physician affiliated with this hospital works because of a severe headache. The patient had been in his usual health until approximately 1 month before admission, when headaches developed. The headaches were initially intermittent and then gradually became persistent, with increasing severity. The patient took paracetamol acetaminophen, but his condition did not improve. On the evening of admission, one episode of emesis occurred. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported a severe frontal headache, neck pain, and photo-phobia, with no hearing loss, visual symptoms, seizures, or new rashes. He had no recent trauma, weight loss, night sweats, cough, or shortness of breath. During the month before admission, the patient had received a diagnosis of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus NIDDM, for which metformin and glibenclamide were administered. He was otherwise well. He reported that he had not been tested for human immunodeficiency virus HIV in the past, and he was taking no other medications. He lived with his wife and children in a suburban area and worked as a long-distance truck driver. He had traveled to Zambia 2 weeks before admission. He had stopped drinking alcohol approximately 2 years before admission and had never smoked tobacco. His sister had NIDDM, and his children were healthy. On examination, the temperature was 36.8C, the blood pressure 125/78 mm Hg, the pulse 53 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. The patient was alert and fully oriented, with a normal level of consciousness. His neck was stiff, with nuchal rigidity, and the remainder of the examination was normal. A peripheral-blood smear and a rapid test for malaria antigen were negative for malaria. A lumbar puncture was performed without additional imaging of the brain, since the patient had no focal neurologic signs. The opening pressure was 25 cm of water normal, 20.

The patient had been well until 1 week before admission, when she had nausea and nonbloody, nonbilious emesis. She did not seek medical care, and her symptoms resolved after several hours. Two days before admission, she had nausea and several episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis in the evening, after she had eaten seafood. The day before admission, she had recurrent vomiting associated with eating but was able to drink large amounts of water. Earlier that day, she had normal interaction with friends and participated in sightseeing activities, including long-distance walking. Early in the evening, she was noted to be slightly confused. Later in the evening, her friend had difficulty arousing her from sleep, and she was not able to follow directions or walk. She was carried to a car by two of her traveling companions and taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 36.1C, the blood pressure 94/64 mm Hg, the pulse 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was lethargic and did not respond to questions or commands. Her speech was incoherent, and she cried intermittently. The pupils were 8 mm in diameter and responsive to light. She moved her arms and legs nonpurposefully. The remainder of the examination was normal. On repeat measurement, the blood pressure was 73/54 mm Hg. Intravenous access was obtained, and 700 ml of normal saline was administered intravenously before the laboratory test results were received. The blood level of sodium was 104 mmol per liter reference range, 135 to 145, potassium 5.1 mmol per liter reference range, 3.5 to 5.0, chloride 74 mmol per liter reference range, 98 to 107, carbon dioxide 19 mmol per liter reference range, 24 to 32, and glucose 114 mg per deciliter 6.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter 3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter and the anion gap was 11 mmol per liter reference range, 3 to 15. The blood level of aspartate aminotransferase was 37 U per liter reference range, 10 to 32, and alanine aminotransferase 37 U per liter reference range, 7 to 35. The blood levels of total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, and lipase were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests. A urine test for human chorionic gonadotropin and a urine drug screen were negative. The blood level of salicylate was less than 0.2 mg per deciliter 0.01 mmol per liter; reference range, 2.8 to 20.0 mg per deciliter 0.20 to 1.44 mmol per liter, and acetaminophen 0 g per milliliter. Intensive care was not available at the other hospital, and the patient was transferred to this hospital by helicopter. During the flight, the patient was agitated and unable to lie still. Ketamine was administered, along with normal saline and hypertonic saline. On evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital, the patient was unable to answer questions, and further history was obtained from her family. She was healthy and used an etono-gestrel implant. She was a graduate student, resided in the southern United States, and was visiting New England with friends. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke tobacco or use over-the-counter medications. Her mother had had breast cancer, but there was no family history of autoimmune disease. On examination, the temperature was 36.7C, the blood pressure 102/57 mm Hg, the pulse 92 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was somnolent and did not respond to commands, but she opened her eyes and withdrew in response to painful stimuli. The pupils were round, equal, and reactive to light. The mucous membranes were moist. The skin turgor was normal. The first and second heart sounds were normal, without murmurs. The breath sounds were normal in both lungs, without wheezing or rhonchi. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft, nondistended, and nontender on palpation. The edge of the liver was not palpable. There was no splenomegaly. The arms and legs had no edema. The remainder of the examination was normal. Additional laboratory studies were performed, and the results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no acute intracranial hemorrhage, infarction, or intracranial mass lesions. Chest radiography revealed low lung volumes without focal consolidation or pulmonary edema, a normal cardiac silhouette, and no pleural effusions. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit ICU, and diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease). ", "prediction": "1. Acute Hyponatremia: This patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, confusion, and low sodium (104 mmol/L) are typical for severe hyponatremia, potentially due to excessive water intake or a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).\n2. Infectious Encephalitis: The combination of confusion, agitation, and somnolence with preceding nausea and vomiting could indicate an infectious cause like viral or bacterial encephalitis.\n3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Although renal function tests are normal, the electrolyte imbalances and hypotension could signal an early stage AKI, possibly precipitated by dehydration or toxin exposure.\n4. Sepsis: The progression of confusion, nausea, and severe hypotension might suggest an underlying septic process, even though there are no clear sources of infection.\n5. Adrenal Insufficiency: Profound hypotension and hyponatremia can be seen in adrenal crisis, which might explain the patient's symptoms given the acute deterioration.\n6. Toxic Ingestion: Despite negative drug toxicity screens, the acute onset of profound neurological symptoms raises the possibility of ingestion of an unnoticed toxin or drug, such as a neurotoxic seafood toxin.\n7. Acute Vomiting Syndrome: The recurrent vomiting episodes could indicate a cyclic vomiting syndrome or gastroenteritis, leading to significant electrolyte disturbances.\n8. Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH): The acute confusion and headache with negative initial CT scan could sometimes miss small SAH or other intracranial pathology that might require more sensitive imaging like MRI or lumbar puncture.\n9. Metabolic Encephalopathy: The symptoms and laboratory findings could point to a metabolic disturbance, potentially linked to her recent excessive physical activity and possible dehydration.\n10. Hyperkalemia-induced Neurological Symptoms: The patient's elevated potassium levels may contribute to neurological disturbances including confusion, though this would usually present alongside more defined cardiac symptoms.\n"}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Akash Gupta Medicine and Pediatrics: A 6-month-old boy was seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of gastrointestinal bleeding and abdominal pain. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 days before presentation, when his parents noted that he began to have intermittent episodes of abdominal pain. During these episodes, some of which woke the patient from sleep, he cried and pulled his legs up toward his chest while lying on his back. His parents reported that they palpated his abdomen during some of the episodes and it felt rigid; they suspected that he might be having discomfort related to excessive intestinal gas. He continued to eat and drink normally without vomiting. The next day, the patient had two bowel movements, and the stools had reddish discoloration. With the first bowel movement, the redness seemed to be present in a small amount and only on the outside of the stool; with the second bowel movement, the amount of redness increased. The patients mother attributed the stool discoloration to beet consumption, since bowel movements with reddish stools had also occurred in the past after the patient had eaten beets. Intermittent episodes of apparent abdominal pain continued, and between the episodes, the patient behaved normally. On the morning of presentation, he had a third bowel movement with reddish stools. His parents took him to day care, where he continued to have occasional periods of crying and pain, followed by a bowel movement that appeared to consist almost entirely of blood, including a large clot. After this bowel movement, he was reportedly pale and diaphoretic. The day care provider called the patients mother, who picked him up and took him to the emergency department of another hospital. On examination at the other hospital, the temperature was 36.5C, the pulse 178 beats per minute, the blood pressure 95/52 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing am-bient air. The weight was 9.1 kg. On palpation of the abdomen, there was diffuse tenderness, which was greater on the right side than on the left, and no masses. There were no external anal fissures, and the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Two hours after arrival at the other hospital, the patient passed a dark-red stool that was described as resembling currant jelly. Intravenous normal saline 5 ml per kilogram was administered, and he was brought by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. The patient had a history of infantile colic and gastroesophageal reflux, which had previously been treated with ranitidine. He received a low-lactose cow milkbased formula. Pureed fruits and vegetables had recently been introduced into his diet, after which constipation developed, his stools became more firm, and daily bowel movements were associated with straining. He received cholecalciferol, and he had begun using an unspecified over-the-counter teething gel and unspecified homeopathic teething tablets 1 week earlier. Immunizations were current through 4 months of age; vaccines including the second dose of live, oral humanbovine reassortant pentavalent rotavirus vaccine had been administered 6 weeks earlier. There were no known allergies. The patient lived with his parents, attended day care, and had no known sick contacts. His parents were from Brazil; he was born in the United States and had not traveled outside the country. There was no family history of bleeding disorders. On examination, the temperature was 36.3C, the pulse 160 beats per minute, the blood pressure 98/47 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared well. Bowel sounds were present; the abdominal examination was otherwise limited because the patient was crying. The diaper contained melena and a small amount of stool. The remainder of the examination was normal. Dr. Ruth Lim: Thirty-five minutes after the patients arrival in the emergency department, an ultrasound examination of the abdomen was performed. There was no evidence of intussus-ception, appendicitis, a focal lesion, or abnormally dilated bowel loops. Bowel peristalsis was present. Dr. Gupta: On examination after ultrasonogra-phy, the pulse was 168 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 94/36 mm Hg. The patient appeared pale. The abdomen was soft, without distention, tenderness, or masses, and bowel sounds were present. Results of the physical examination were otherwise unchanged. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, aspartate amino-transferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and C-reactive protein were normal, as were the anion gap, platelet count, red-cell indexes, and results of renal-function tests. The results of other laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Packed red cells were transfused, and pantopra-zole and famotidine were administered intravenously. A diagnosis was made.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Areej El-Jawahri HematologyOncology: A 61-year-old woman was seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of leg swelling and back pain. The patient had been in her usual health until approximately 3 months before this presentation, when mild swelling of her left leg developed. Three days before this presentation, pain in the back, both flanks, and left leg developed and the leg swelling increased. She came to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient reported no trauma, fevers, night sweats, or weight loss. She had arthritis, asthma, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and noninsulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the remote past, she had reportedly had a positive tuberculin skin test. She had undergone a partial colectomy for resection of a stage T1 colon cancer without adjuvant chemotherapy 7 years earlier, as well as a lumpectomy of the left breast, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for benign disease. Medications included metformin, triamterenehydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, atorvastatin, aspirin, loratadine, and, as needed, an albuterol inhaler. She had no known allergies. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was widowed and of African-American ancestry. Her father had had Alzheimers disease and diabetes mellitus; her mother had had heart disease and breast cancer; a sister had breast cancer; a brother had hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and coronary artery disease; and two brothers had had diabetes mellitus and had died before they were 70 years of age. Her children and grandchildren were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 150/77 mm Hg, and the pulse 75 beats per minute; the temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were normal. There was paraspinal tenderness in the lumbar region and mild 1 nonpitting edema of the left calf and ankle; the remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit was 33.8 reference range, 36.0 to 46.0, the hemoglobin level 11.3 g per deciliter reference range, 12.0 to 16.0, and the d-dimer level 2079 ng per milliliter reference range, 500. The white-cell count, differential count, platelet count, red-cell indexes, prothrombin time, prothrombin-time international normalized ratio, results of renal- and liver-function tests, and a urinalysis were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, total protein, albumin, and globulin; testing for creatine kinase isoenzymes and troponin I was negative. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities that were more marked than those seen on an electrocardiogram obtained 8 months earlier. Noninvasive studies of the legs revealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. Dr. Victorine V. Muse: On the patients presentation to the emergency department, computed tomography CT of the chest was performed after the administration of contrast material, in accordance with a pulmonary-embolism protocol. A right apical soft-tissue lesion 4.0 cm in cross-sectional diameter that extended into the lateral chest wall was present Fig. 1A. Enlarged bilateral axillary lymph nodes up to 1.8 cm in cross-sectional diameter were also present Fig. 1B, and enlarged bilateral hilar lymph nodes 1.0 cm in cross-sectional diameter were present without other mediastinal lymphadenopathy. CT images of the lower chest and a CT angiogram that included the upper abdomen showed the superior aspect of a large retroperitoneal soft-tissue mass that extended into both kidneys, as well as hydro-nephrosis of the right kidney Fig. 1C. Abdominal and pelvic CT to further evaluate the mass was recommended. Dr. El-Jawahri: Three days later, the patient was seen by her internist. On examination, the blood pressure was 160/90 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 30.8. An enlarged lymph node 1.0 cm in cross-sectional diameter was detected on palpation under the pectoralis major muscle in the anterior right axilla. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, white-cell count, and differential count were stable. The reticulocyte count was 2.6 reference range, 0.5 to 2.5, and the blood uric acid level was 7.1 mg per deciliter 422 mol per liter; reference range, 2.3 to 6.6 mg per deciliter 137 to 393 mol per liter. Blood levels of iron, iron-binding capacity, ferritin, lactate dehydro-genase, and carcinoembryonic antigen were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests. Cytologic examination of the urine revealed reactive transitional cells and neutrophils but no malignant cells. Dr. Muse: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed 3 days after the patients presentation to the emergency department, revealed a massive conglomerate of enlarged lymph nodes; it extended from the level of the celiac axis to below the aortic bifurcation and into the pelvis, and it resulted in marked attenuation of the renal vessels and inferior vena cava, hydronephrosis of the right kidney, and infiltration of soft tissue into the left kidney Fig. 1D. The soft-tissue abnormality extended into the small-bowel mesentery Fig. 1E and along the pelvic sidewalls. The liver and spleen were normal, as were all the other abdominal organs and the bowel. Dr. El-Jawahri: The next day, the patient was seen by a urologist, and 8 days after that, she was seen by a surgeon, who recommended a retroperitoneal biopsy. Two weeks after her initial presentation, she was seen again by her internist. The patient reported intermittent edema of the left leg with mild pain, dyspnea on exertion, moderate discomfort in the left lower abdomen, and night sweats. On examination, enlarged lymph nodes were detected on palpation under the pectoralis muscles bilaterally, and the left thigh and calf were edematous, without tenderness or tension. Two days later, repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed, and the results were unchanged from previous studies. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and white-cell count were stable; blood levels of electrolytes and lactate dehydrogenase and results of coagulation and renal- and liver-function tests were normal. Twenty-four days after the patients initial presentation, a diagnostic procedure was performed, and management decisions were made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Indolent lymphoma, most likely follicular lymphoma. ", "prediction": "1. Lymphoma: The extensive lymphadenopathy and large retroperitoneal mass, along with systemic symptoms like night sweats, suggest a possible lymphoproliferative disorder such as lymphoma.\n2.

Tuberculosis: The patient has a history of a positive tuberculin skin test, and tuberculous lymphadenitis could present with enlarged lymph nodes and a retroperitoneal mass.\n4. Sarcoidosis: Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy along with systemic symptoms raises the possibility of sarcoidosis, a multisystem granulomatous disease.\n5. Retroperitoneal fibrosis: The mass extending into both kidneys and causing hydronephrosis could be due to retroperitoneal fibrosis, which can lead to obstructive uropathy.\n6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Although noninvasive studies revealed no DVT, her leg swelling, elevated D-dimer, and risk factors such as immobility and malignancy warrants consideration.\n7. Renal cell carcinoma: The involvement of the kidneys and the retroperitoneal mass with renal vessel attenuation could indicate primary renal malignancy with lymphatic spread.\n8. Large retroperitoneal sarcoma: A primary retroperitoneal sarcoma can present as a large mass involving adjacent structures such as kidneys and lymph nodes.\n9. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE): Involvement of multiple organs, lymphadenopathy, and systemic symptoms could point towards an autoimmune condition like SLE.\n10.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Daniel H. Katz Medicine: A 34-year-old man with hearing impairment was admitted to this hospital because of worsening renal function. The patient had been well until approximately 11 weeks before this admission, when subjective fevers with sweats, fatigue, decreased appetite, and nausea developed. He initially attributed these symptoms, which worsened over the next 2 months, to the hot weather. Cough and shortness of breath on exertion also developed during that time, and the patient noted that his urine appeared foamy. He reportedly lost 9 kg. Twenty-two days before this admission, the patient presented to the emergency department at another hospital for evaluation. The blood creatinine level was 0.8 mg per deciliter 71 mol per liter; normal range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter 53 to 133 mol per liter, and the blood urea nitrogen level was 7 mg per deciliter 2.5 mmol per liter; normal range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter 2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter. The patient left the hospital without being evaluated by a physician. The patient returned to the emergency department at the other hospital 1 week later 15 days before this admission and reported that he had been having malaise, vomiting, and chest pain for the past 2 days. The chest pain worsened during inspiration. On examination, the temperature was 36.6C, the pulse 76 beats per minute, the blood pressure 110/73 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95 while he was breathing ambient air. He had hearing aids in both ears and nontender, enlarged lymph nodes in the neck. Breath sounds were diminished bilaterally, and faint rhonchi were heard at the base of both lungs on auscultation. The abdomen was soft and flat, with mild, diffuse tenderness on palpation; the remainder of the examination was normal. The platelet count, red-cell indexes, and anion gap were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, lipase, and lactic acid; the results of other laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed cloudy, amber urine with a specific gravity of 1.037, a pH of 5.0, a moderate amount of occult blood, a protein level of at least 500 mg per deciliter, a glucose level of 50 mg per deciliter, and a ketone level of 20 mg per deciliter by dipstick; on microscopic examination, there were 0 to 2 red cells and 10 to 25 white cells per high-power field and a moderate amount of hyaline casts. An electrocardiogram showed no evidence of cardiac ischemia. Dr. Grace C. Lo: Computed tomographic CT angiography of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed mild subpleural interlobular septal thickening without lobar consolidation or evidence of acute pulmonary embolism. Dr. Katz: While the patient was in the emergency department, the temperature rose to 37.9C, and he reported malaise. Blood samples were obtained for culture, and acetaminophen was administered. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. Intravenous fluids were administered. By the next day, the chest pain had resolved. The platelet count, red-cell indexes, and anion gap were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and lactic acid; the results of other laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Dr. Lo: Noninvasive ultrasonography of both legs was performed and did not reveal evidence of deep venous thrombosis. A prominent inguinal lymph node 1.5 cm by 0.6 cm by 1.5 cm was seen on the right side. On ultrasonography of the abdomen, there was borderline enlargement of the spleen, which measured 13.3 cm in length normal range, 12. The right kidney measured 12.3 cm in length, and the left kidney measured 12.4 cm in length; markedly echogenic renal parenchyma was present bilaterally Fig. 1A. Dr. Katz: Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60 to 65 and no pericardial effusion. The administration of intravenous fluids was continued. On the third hospital day, the platelet count, red-cell indexes, and anion gap were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, C3, and C4; tests for antiproteinase 3 antibodies and antimyelo-peroxidase antibodies were negative. Urinalysis revealed cloudy, amber urine with a specific gravity of 1.040, a pH of 5.0, a moderate amount of blood, a protein level of at least 500 mg per deciliter, a glucose level of 50 mg per deciliter, and a ketone level of 20 mg per deciliter by dipstick; on microscopic examination, there were 0 to 2 red cells and 10 to 25 white cells per high-power field, few white-cell clumps, and occasional hyaline casts. The urinary creatinine level was 298 mg per deciliter normal range, 20 to 370, and the urinary total protein level was higher than 2500 mg per deciliter normal range, 5 to 25 other hospital. Dr. Lo: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed patchy atelectasis of the lung bases, mild left paraaortic retroperitoneal lymph-adenopathy, persistent bilateral enhancement of the kidneys related to the previous administration of contrast material, and trace free fluid in the pelvis Fig. 1B and 1C. Dr. Katz: A diagnostic test result was received, and medical therapy was initiated. During the next 8 days, edema of the lower legs developed. Furosemide, calcium acetate, sodium bicarbonate, and a multivitamin were administered. The patient continued to produce urine. Laboratory test results obtained on the 11th hospital day 5 days before admission are shown in Table 1; furosemide was discontinued. The next day, a tunneled hemodialysis catheter was inserted in the right internal jugular vein. The patient underwent three sessions of hemo-dialysis during the next 4 days. On the 16th hospital day, he was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. On admission to this hospital, the patient reported that the leg swelling had improved and that he felt well. He had a history of anxiety. When he was 7 years of age, he was struck by a motor vehicle as a pedestrian; thereafter, progressive bilateral hearing loss developed. Before admission to the other hospital, the patient had been taking no medications; he had an allergy to ibuprofen, which caused a rash. He worked as a laborer and lived with a friend in an urban area of New England. He had separated from the female partner with whom he had two children, and he had sex with men and women. He had never received a transfusion of blood products. Approximately 6 weeks earlier, he had been in a fistfight with another person, and blood from that person made contact with open wounds on his hands and near his eyes. He had smoked a half pack of cigarettes per day for the past 15 years, and he used marijuana; he did not drink alcohol or use other illicit drugs. His mother had coronary artery disease, and he did not know his father; there was no known family history of kidney disease. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 37.2°C, the pulse 76 beats per minute, the blood pressure 138//93 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. The weight was 82 kg. A hemodialysis catheter exiting the right chest was present, and there was 2+ pitting edema of the legs to the mid-shins; the remainder of the examination was normal. The results of laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. During the first 24 hours, the patient drank 890 ml of fluid and had 4425 ml of urine output. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine with a specific gravity of 1.008, a pH of 8.0, 3+ glucose, 2+ protein, and 1+ blood by dipstick, as well as 0 to 2 red cells per high-power field. The urine osmolality was 277 mOsm per kilogram of water (normal range, 15 to 1150). The urinary level of creatinine was 47 mg per deciliter, total protein 368.5 mg per deciliter (normal range, 0 to 13.5 [this hospital]), microalbumin 194.5 mg per deciliter (normal range, 0 to 2.0), and sodium 84 mmol per liter.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Haatem M. Reda: A 41-year-old man was seen in the neurology clinic of this hospital because of seizures, weakness, and cognitive decline. The patient had a history of migraine headaches, sensorineural hearing loss, and chronic proteinuria. He had been in his usual health until approximately 2 years before presentation to this hospital, when his wife noted subtle changes in his personality and behavior, including short-tempered and argumentative reactions that didnt make sense. One year before presentation to this hospital, headache, malaise, and fatigue occurred for approximately 1 week, followed by the sudden onset of difficulty speaking; over a period of several hours, he progressed from being able to use well-formed but incorrect words to being completely unable to speak and partially unable to write. Later that day, he was admitted to another hospital. Dr. William A. Copen: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the brain was performed 1 year, 10 months, and 7 months before the patients presentation to this hospital Fig. 1. All the studies revealed global brain parenchymal volume loss that was far more advanced than would be expected for a patient of this age. On the first study Fig. 1A, T2-weighted images showed a mildly expansile, hyperin-tense intraaxial lesion that was centered in the anterior left temporal lobe and extended posteriorly and superiorly into the inferior parietal lobule. This lesion disproportionately involved the subcortical white matter, although the cortex was also affected. There was no evidence of associated restricted diffusion or magnetic susceptibility effect and no abnormal enhancement on contrast-enhanced images. On the two subsequent studies Fig. 1B and 1C, the lesion maintained similar signal characteristics but decreased in size; in fact, the third study revealed that the lesion had resolved almost completely. The results of magnetic resonance angiography and venography were normal. Dr. Reda: On the patients admission to the other hospital, 1 year before presentation to this hospital, laboratory testing revealed mild anemia, with a mean cor-puscular volume of 65 fl reference range, 79 to 92; other test results, including the results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis, are shown in Table 1. A diagnosis of stroke was made, and therapy with aspirin and a lipid-lowering agent was begun. The patient was discharged home. His language abilities gradually improved over the next 2 months but did not return to baseline, and his headaches persisted. One month after discharge, while the patient was at home, he had a generalized tonicclonic seizure that was witnessed by his wife. Therapy with levetiracetam was begun, and no further seizure activity occurred. During the next 11 months, he had fluctuating focal neurologic symptoms, rapidly progressive cognitive decline, weakness, and gait instability, along with nearly daily diffuse headaches, muscle cramps in his calves, and weight loss of 11 kg. One month before the patients presentation to this hospital, blood levels of cholesterol and lipids and results of liver- and renal-function tests were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. During the 2 weeks before presentation, the patients wife noted that his behavior had become more childlike, with rambling speech, impulsivity, and anger. His gait, balance, and coordination worsened, although he did not fall, and swallowing difficulties developed. He was referred to the neurology clinic at this hospital. The patient was right-handed. He had congenital short stature. When he was 25 years of age, sensorineural hearing loss worse on the right side than on the left developed; it gradually worsened and led to the use of hearing aids. Proteinuria was noted when he was 25 years of age. In the past, a clinical diagnosis of gout had been made after an episode of swelling and pain in the left big toe. Medications were levetiracetam, lisinopril, and a multivitamin. He had no known allergies. He was married, had a young child, and had lived in the southwestern United States until 3 weeks before this presentation, when his family moved to be near relatives in New England. He was a lawyer but had been receiving disability benefits since the onset of this illness. He drank alcohol in moderation and smoked tobacco occasionally. His mother was of French Canadian and Irish descent; she had reportedly had lupus nephritis with antinuclear antibodies, diabetes mellitus, and colitis and was described as needing rest frequently when walking. His father was of Hungarian and Italian descent and had diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease. A maternal aunt and uncle had diabetes mellitus, and the same uncle also had sensorineural hearing loss. He had nine siblings who ranged in height from 150 to 163 cm; some were reportedly well and others had mild gastrointestinal dysmotility or symptoms of the irritable bowel syndrome, senso-rineural hearing loss, anxiety, and -thalassemia trait. On examination, the patient appeared cachec-tic. The blood pressure was 112/72 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the temperature 36.8C, and the oxygen saturation 99 while he was breathing ambient air. His weight was 40.5 kg, and his height 152 cm. During the examination, he reached out to grab the examiners hand and glasses inappropriately. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 25 on a scale ranging from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating better cognitive function; points were deducted because the patient made errors of visuospatial function, repetition, and fluency and incorrectly identified a glove as a hand and a feather as a leaf. He had ataxic dysarthria with telegraphic speech and frequent tangential ramblings that were difficult to interrupt. The optic disks were flat and without pallor. The visual fields were normal on confrontation testing. The pupils were round, equal, and reactive, without Horners syndrome or a relative afferent pupillary defect. Upward gaze was markedly restricted, lateral gaze moderately restricted, and downward gaze mildly restricted in each eye. There was mild bifacial weakness and markedly impaired hearing bilaterally, even while the patient was wearing hearing aids. There was minimal weakness of shoulder abduction bilaterally. The muscle bulk, tone, and strength of the neck and limbs were otherwise normal, without tremor, other adventitious movements, or fasciculations. Fingernosefinger and heelkneeshin testing revealed subtle dys-metria; rapid alternating movements were slightly irregular. No truncal ataxia was present while the patient was seated. He swayed prominently while he stood with his feet together and eyes closed. His gait was mildly ataxic, and he could not take more than two tandem steps without losing his balance. The remainder of the neuro-logic and general examinations was normal. Laboratory testing revealed a mild secondary carnitine deficiency, which was thought to be dietary. The lactic acid level was initially normal but subsequently increased and remained elevated; the highest level was 8.3 mmol per liter 75 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter 5 to 20 mg per deciliter. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Diagnostic procedures were performed.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Lauren R. Zeitels Medicine: A 20-year-old man was seen in an outpatient clinic of this hospital because of pain and swelling of the left calf and a purpuric rash. The patient had been well until 3 weeks before presentation to this hospital, when sore throat, nonproductive cough, rhinorrhea, and chills developed. He noted areas of crusting and occasional bleeding in both nares Fig. 1. His brother had reportedly received a recent diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. Two weeks before presentation to this hospital, the patient had traveled by airplane to the northwestern United States for a wilderness backpacking trip. Shortly after he arrived, cramping pain developed in his left calf. Over the next 2 days, the pain worsened in severity and was associated with swelling of the calf. He presented to another clinic for evaluation. Noninvasive ultrasonography of the lower leg was performed, and the results were reportedly normal. Ibuprofen was recommended for pain control, and azithromycin was prescribed for suspected upper respiratory infection. Despite the administration of ibuprofen, the pain in the left calf worsened and limited the patients ability to bear weight. The swelling progressed from the calf to the foot, and an erythematous rash developed on the dorsum of both feet. One week before presentation to this hospital, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital. He had a history of Crohns disease, which had been diagnosed when he was 10 years of age and had resulted in prolonged glucocorticoid use. During the previous 3 years, weekly treatment with adalimumab led to clinical improvement in his Crohns disease and he had a considerable growth spurt, in which he gained several inches in height. During the previous several years, the patient had had multiple self-limited episodes of sore throat, nonproductive cough, rhinorrhea, and nasal crusting with associated bleeding. He occasionally used ibuprofen at home but took no other over-the-counter or herbal medications. He was a college student and resided in the central United States. He drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. He had a sibling with Crohns disease. On examination at the other hospital, the temperature was 36.2C, the blood pressure 118/70 mm Hg, the pulse 70 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. He did not appear ill but was in mild distress because of the pain in the left lower leg. The nasal crusting and the swelling of nasal mucous membranes had markedly improved during the previous 2 weeks. The nasal septum was intact, and no nasal polyps or blood were present. Examination of the neck, heart, lungs, and abdomen was normal. There was tenderness on palpation and swelling in the left lower leg from the calf to the dorsal aspect of the foot, without erythema, warmth, or pitting Fig. 2A. Synovitis of the left ankle was present. Peripheral pulses were normal. Nontender pur-puric lesions, including some that were faintly palpable, were present on both lower legs but were more numerous on the left leg Fig. 2B. Two tender nodules each 1 cm in diameter with overlying erythema were present above the right medial malleolus Fig. 2C and were similar to lesions the patient had had transiently in the past. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, creatine kinase, C3, and C4 were normal, as were results of renal- and liver-function tests, the complete blood count, and the differential count. Assays for antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ANCAs were negative. Tests for hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis B virus surface antibodies, hepatitis C virus antibodies, human immunodeficiency virus HIV type 1 p24 antigen, and HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies were negative. Blood cultures showed no growth. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.014 and a pH of 5.5 and with no glucose, ketones, bilirubin, protein, blood, or nitrates by dipstick; examination of the sediment revealed no red cells, white cells, bacteria, or casts. The blood C-reactive protein level was 2.0 mg per deciliter reference range, 0 to 0.9, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 30 mm per hour reference range, 10, and an antistreptolysin O titer 400 IU per milliliter reference range, 0 to 200. Radiography of the chest revealed a normal cardiac silhouette and no consolidations or pleural effusions. Computed tomography of the tibia, fibula, and foot, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed normal osseous structures without fractures or cortical erosions, as well as diffuse nonspecific edema of the soft tissues of the ankle and proximal dorsal foot without abscesses or deep fascial thickening. The patient was admitted to the other hospital, and diagnostic tests were performed. He then traveled to New England to visit family and was referred to this hospital for further treatment.

Infection (cellulitis): Despite the absence of warmth or erythema, the persistent calf pain and swelling raise the possibility of a deep-seated infection.\n6. Drug-induced vasculitis: The use of ibuprofen and azithromycin could potentially trigger drug-induced vasculitis, presenting with purpura and leg pain.\n7. Thrombophlebitis: Inflammation of the veins, especially with the patient's travel history, could account for the symptoms even in the presence of normal ultrasound findings.\n8. Autoimmune vasculitis: Given the negative results for ANCA and ANA but the clinical presentation of palpable purpura, an autoimmune vasculitis not covered by these tests is possible.\n9. Pyoderma gangrenosum: Although rare, the presence of tender erythematous nodules, coupled with Crohn’s disease, raises the possibility of pyoderma gangrenosum.\n10.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Alyssa R. Letourneau: A 27-year-old woman was evaluated in the infectious disease clinic of this hospital because of skin lesions, anemia, thrombocytosis, and an elevated blood alkaline phosphatase level. Eleven months before this presentation, the patient traveled abroad; she lived for 2 months in Morocco and then for 2 months in Thailand, and during that time, she also traveled briefly to South Korea. She returned to New England and was well until 5 months before this presentation, when a painful erythematous papule developed on her chin. During the next week, she felt feverish. More papules developed near the initial skin lesion and coalesced into a plaque. A similar, larger skin lesion developed on the right forearm, and a small amount of white fluid drained from it. The patient presented to her primary care physician at another hospital for evaluation. At the primary care clinic, the patient reported myalgias and occasional sore throat. On examination, the temperature was 36.8C and the blood pressure 110/60 mm Hg. A 1-cm erythematous plaque with no ulceration was present on the left side of the chin, and a 1.5-cm lesion that was similar in appearance was present on the right forearm. Cephalexin was prescribed. Three days later, the skin lesions had not improved, and a new lesion had developed on the left forearm. The patient returned to the primary care clinic. On examination, the lesion on the right forearm was fluctuant. Incision yielded a small amount of bloody fluid; a culture of this fluid had no growth. A blood culture was also negative. Blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransfer-ase, total bilirubin, total protein, and albumin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed increased echo-genicity of the hepatic parenchyma a finding suggestive of fatty infiltration with no focal lesions of the liver. The gallbladder was normal, with no gallstones, and there was no dilatation of the intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile duct. Trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and topical mupirocin were prescribed, and the patient was referred to a gastroen-terologist because of the elevated blood alkaline phosphatase level. In the gastroenterology clinic, the patient reported intermittent fatigue but no pruritus, abdominal pain, or arthralgias. Tests for antimito-chondrial antibodies and antinuclear antibodies were negative. Results of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography confirmed that the gallbladder, intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary systems, and size and contour of the liver were normal. The elevated blood alkaline phosphatase level was thought to be related to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; weight loss was advised. The patient returned to the primary care clinic for follow-up after completing the 7-day course of trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole and topical mu-pirocin for treatment of the skin lesions. She reported that the lesions had decreased in size but continued to be painful. On examination, the lesion on the left forearm had resolved, and the lesion on the left side of the chin had decreased in size, flattened in appearance, and faded. The lesion on the right forearm remained erythematous and raised, with an overlying serous crust. The patient was referred to a dermatologist for further evaluation. On examination in the dermatology clinic, there were well-demarcated, atrophic, depressed plaques on the left side of the chin. The appearance of the lesion on the right forearm was unchanged, and Grams staining and culture of that lesion were negative. Cephalexin and topical clo-betasol were prescribed. During the next week, the lesion on the chin recurred, and the patient returned to the primary care clinic. On examination, a 2-cm circular, ery-thematous plaque was present at the site of the previous chin lesion, and the lesion on the right forearm had increased in size to 2 cm in diameter. A shave biopsy of the lesion on the chin was performed. Histologic examination reportedly revealed a perifollicular granulomatous and mixed inflammatory infiltrate that included neutrophils and eosinophils. No organisms were seen on periodic acidSchiff staining, Grams staining, or staining for acid-fast bacilli. Doxycycline was prescribed. The patient traveled to Jordan and stayed for 4 weeks; during that time, the lesion on the left side of the chin receded, the lesion on the right forearm doubled in size, and the lesion on the left forearm recurred. Clusters of painful vulvo-vaginal ulcers developed; these waxed and waned. On her return to New England, the patient was referred by her primary care physician to an infectious disease specialist at this hospital. In the infectious disease clinic, the patient reported a 5-month history of waxing and waning skin lesions, a 2-month history of episodic vulvo-vaginal ulcers, and occasional nausea. She had a history of attention-deficit disorder. She took a combination birth control pill daily. Her father had diabetes mellitus, and her mother had hypertension and polymyalgia rheumatica. The patient was of European descent. She was a graduate student and traveled abroad frequently for internships. While she was in Morocco 11 months earlier, she rode on a camel; while she was in Thailand, she petted an elephant and swam in freshwater waterfall pools. She had not visited farms or milked animals and had no known sick contacts. She had been sexually active for several years with one partner, who used condoms. On examination, the temperature was 36.5C, the blood pressure 90/52 mm Hg, the pulse 66 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 24.9. On the left side of the chin, there was a 2-cm area of faded erythema with a depressed, atrophic plaque. On each forearm, there was a 5-cm, well-demarcated, depressed, atrophic plaque with no ulceration or crust. Two 2-mm ulcers were present on the right labium minus and vaginal four-chette. The remainder of the examination was normal. An interferon- release assay for Myco-bacterium tuberculosis was negative, as were tests for hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis B virus core IgM antibodies, human immunodeficiency virus HIV type 1 p24 antigen, and HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose and results of renal-function tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The biopsy specimen from the left side of the chin that had been obtained 4 months earlier was reviewed at this hospital. Dr. Ruth K. Foreman: Histologic examination of the shave-biopsy specimen revealed a granulo-matous dermal infiltrate Fig. 1A that was composed of macrophages and scattered giant cells arranged in loose clusters. Admixed neutrophils and eosinophils were also seen Fig. 1B. No microorganisms were identified on Grams staining, periodic acidSchiff staining, staining for acid-fast bacilli, or Giemsa staining. These histologic features are consistent with the diagnosis of granuloma-tous dermatitis, an entity that has numerous infectious and noninfectious causes. In this case, the shave-biopsy specimen consisted of only superficial dermis, and many of the features necessary for definitive pathological diagnosis were not present in the specimen. Given the presence of neutrophils, infection should be ruled out before noninfectious causes are considered. Dr. Letourneau: Additional laboratory tests were performed; the results are shown in Table 2. Computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was ordered. Four weeks after the patient was evaluated in the infectious disease clinic of this hospital, fatigue and weakness developed in the left arm, along with associated numbness and tingling. The patient was evaluated in a clinic at this hospital, and the blood pressure could not be obtained in either arm despite multiple attempts at manual sphygmomanometry. The radial pulses were not palpable, but the hands were warm and had no changes in skin color. A diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Takayasu’s arteritis.

Sweet's Syndrome: The rapid development of painful erythematous papules, plaques, feverish feeling, and neutrophilic infiltrate strongly suggest Sweet's syndrome.\n7. Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus: The photosensitive nature of the plaques along with granulomatous inflammatory infiltrate could denote SCLE.\n8. Infective Endocarditis: The skin lesions, fatigue, myalgias, anemia, and negative blood cultures could fit the profile for culture-negative infective endocarditis.\n9.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. John O. Schorge: A 69-year-old woman was evaluated at the gynecologic oncology clinic of this hospital because of persistent urinary incontinence. Seven years before this evaluation, the patient had received a diagnosis of superficial bladder cancer low grade, for which a transurethral resection was performed. During the next 5 years, urologic evaluation with annual surveillance cystoscopy revealed no evidence of recurrent disease. Urination occurred frequently and urgently, and tolterodine was administered as needed for symptom control. Twenty-one months before the current evaluation, the patient was seen by a urogynecologist for persistent urinary incontinence that occurred with bending over, coughing, and sneezing. Urination occurred up to 12 times daily and twice nightly. The patient reported no hematuria, dysuria, incomplete voiding, high fluid intake, pelvic or vaginal pressure or heaviness, prolapse, or fecal incontinence. On an examination that was limited to the pelvis, the uterus was estimated to be similar in size to the uterus of a pregnant woman at 12 weeks of gestation. The uterus was mobile and nontender, and these features were thought to be consistent with a fibroid. The adnexa were difficult to assess because of the enlarged uterus. Point-of-care urine dipstick testing was positive for blood. On measurement of the postvoiding residual urine volume, 270 ml of urine was left in the bladder. Pelvic ultrasonography was performed, and the patient was referred for pelvic-floor physical therapy. Dr. Aoife Kilcoyne: On a pelvic ultrasound image, the uterus measured 8.5 cm by 8.9 cm by 9.6 cm. A heterogeneous mass measuring 6.4 cm by 7.8 cm by 8.4 cm was identified in the uterus. There were multiple small areas of hypoechogenicity in the mass that were most likely consistent with cystic changes or necrosis. The mass had some areas of increased peripheral vascularity. The endometrial echo-complex was not well visualized because of distortion by the mass, but the visualized portion measured 6 mm. The ovaries were not identified, but there were no large adnexal masses. Dr. Schorge: Seventeen months before this evaluation, the patient presented to her gynecologist for follow-up. She had completed 3 months of pelvic-floor physical therapy and noted that the urinary incontinence had improved slightly. On examination of the pelvis, the mass was reportedly unchanged in size, but the uterus was estimated to be similar in size to the uterus of a pregnant woman at 16 weeks of gestation. Additional imaging studies were performed. Dr. Kilcoyne: On repeat ultrasonography performed 15 months before this evaluation, the uterus measured 8.9 cm by 9.2 cm by 11.2 cm and had heterogeneous echogenicity. A large fibroid measuring 7.2 cm by 7.6 cm by 8.0 cm was present on the left side of the uterus, and it had areas of internal hypoechogenicity that were probably consistent with fluid. Dr. Schorge: One month later, tenderness in the left lower quadrant developed. After 3 days of symptoms, the patient was evaluated at another hospital, where mild leukocytosis was noted. Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed at the other hospital, reportedly revealed a cystic lesion measuring 7.1 cm by 7.4 cm by 7.4 cm in the uterus that was thought to represent cystic degeneration. The size of the mass on CT was similar to previous measurements of the mass on ultrasonography. Follow-up pelvic ultrasonography at 2-month intervals was recommended. At that time, it was thought that in the absence of vaginal bleeding, the pain was probably caused by a degenerating fibroid, and it was recommended that repeat pelvic ultrasonography be performed in 6 weeks. Dr. Kilcoyne: Pelvic ultrasonography performed 6 weeks later 12 months before this evaluation revealed a fibroid measuring 5.6 cm by 6.5 cm by 6.7 cm on the left side of the uterus that had internal cystic spaces. The fibroid had decreased in overall size since the previous study but had a higher number of cystic components, and it was probably consistent with a large degenerating fibroid. Follow-up pelvic ultrasonography performed 4 months later 8 months before this evaluation revealed a hypoechoic lesion measuring 5.2 cm by 5.4 cm by 5.8 cm that probably represented a uterine fibroid. Eight months later 4 days before this evaluation, pelvic ultrasonography was again performed Fig. 1. This examination revealed that the mass had increased in size to 6.9 cm by 8.8 cm by 10.3 cm and again had central cystic compo-nents. The endometrial echocomplex was 4 mm, with no pelvic free fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the pelvis was recommended. Dr. Schorge: The patient was referred to the gynecologic oncology clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, she reported transient vulvar itching, urinary incontinence, and no constitutional symptoms such as weight loss, constipation, diarrhea, urinary frequency, urinary urgency, or dysuria. She had never had an abnormal Papanicolaou smear. The patient was gravida 3, para 2 two vaginal deliveries. Her last mammogram had been obtained 8 months earlier and was reportedly normal; she conducted breast self-examinations regularly. The patients medical history included bladder cancer, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. Medications were warfarin, meto-prolol succinate, atorvastatin, fish oil, lorazepam as needed, and doxepin, as well as calcium, vitamin D, and a multivitamin. Adverse drug reactions included a rash with sulfa drugs. The patient was married and did aerobic exercise three times weekly. She drank wine twice weekly and had never smoked. There was no family history of cancer. On examination, the patient appeared younger than her stated age. The temperature was 36.7C, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 173/77 mm Hg. The weight was 66.7 kg, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 25.6. The abdomen was soft and non-tender. Results of pelvic and rectal examinations were unchanged from the results of recent examinations, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Additional imaging studies and a diagnostic procedure were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Leiomyosarcoma, high grade, conventional type.", "prediction": "1. Degenerating uterine fibroid: The consistent imaging findings of a large heterogeneous mass with cystic components and corresponding symptoms strongly suggest a degenerating fibroid.\n2. Uterine sarcoma: The increase in size and atypical features of the mass, including rapid growth and necrotic areas, raise concerns for a malignant transformation such as sarcoma.\n3. Pelvic organ prolapse: The patient's urinary incontinence and large uterine mass could exert pressure on the bladder, causing similar incontinence and urgency symptoms.\n4. Endometrial cancer: Although less likely without bleeding, the poor visualization of the endometrial echo-complex and patient history warrant consideration of endometrial pathology.\n5. Bladder cancer recurrence: Persistent urinary incontinence and presence of bladder symptoms, despite a lack of hematuria, keep the recurrence of superficial bladder cancer in differential.\n6. Uterine adenomyosis: The heterogeneous uterine mass and pelvic pain could be consistent with diffuse adenomyosis, a condition often presenting with similar ultrasound findings.\n7. Ovarian cancer: Despite ovaries not being visualized, a large pelvic mass and difficulty distinguishing adnexal masses on imaging put ovarian malignancy on the differential.\n8. Chronic urinary tract infection: Chronic and persistent urinary symptoms, alongside leukocytosis, may indicate a less obvious chronic UTI contributing to incontinence.\n9. Uterine leiomyosarcoma: Given the rapid growth of the uterine mass and necrotic areas, a rare and aggressive form of leiomyosarcoma must be considered.\n10. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): Chronic pelvic pain and persistent urinary symptoms could be explained by a subacute or chronic PID leading to inflammation and mass effect."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Juliana Mariani Pediatrics: A 14-year-old boy was seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of fear of choking while swallowing. The patient had been well until 2 days before admission, when he choked while eating a piece of chicken during dinner. He became fearful of swallowing and was unable to finish the meal despite cutting his food into small pieces. The next day, he vomited after trying to eat ice cream, and his daily fluid intake decreased to only 710 ml 24 oz of water. He reportedly needed his mother near him throughout the day and had an irrational fear of choking. He had not had recent fevers, rhinorrhea, cough, or sore throat. Nine days earlier, during a routine annual examination at the clinic of the patients primary care pediatrician, the patients mother reported that he had had several episodes of inspiratory stridor while he was sleeping during the past few weeks; the patient was referred to an otolaryn-gologist, but this visit had not yet occurred. On the day of this presentation, the patient consumed only small sips of water, reported feeling hungry, and slept most of the day. His mother noted that, in addition to the inspiratory stridor during sleep, the patient had some gasping for air that was associated with deep involuntary burping. She contacted a physician at this hospital and was advised to bring the patient to the emergency department for evaluation. The patient had been delivered at full term. He had a nuchal cord at birth, and the birth weight was 3.6 kg. Apgar scores at 1, 5, and 10 minutes were 2, 6, and 9, respectively, and initial resuscitation efforts were provided. Subsequent growth and development were reportedly normal. As an infant, the patient had had gastro-esophageal reflux and a milk-protein allergy, and he had received some training on sensory-integration skills during childhood. Immunizations had been administered through 2.5 years of age; after that age, the recommended routine vaccinations were refused by the patients parents. The patient had keratosis pilaris and eczema. He took no medications and had no known allergies. He lived with his family in a suburb and was a student who received writing support. His younger brother had moderate autism spectrum disorder, with verbal but not conversational skills, and had received diagnoses of PANDAS pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections and vitamin D deficiency. Both parents were healthy. The patients maternal grandfather had heart disease and non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, his maternal grandmother had had psoriasis and had died from breast cancer, an aunt had hypoglycemia, and his paternal grandmother had hypertension, hypoglycemia, and congestive heart failure. On examination in the emergency department, the patient was alert and appeared to be anxious. He had persistent involuntary burping, with evidence of drooling on his shirt. The temperature was 36.1C, the blood pressure 127/64 mm Hg, the pulse 67 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, the weight 54.1 kg 60th percentile for his age, and the height 160 cm 32nd percentile for his age. The oral mucosal membranes were dry. Sexual development was classified as Tanner stage 4 with stages ranging from 1 to 5 and higher stages indicating more advanced pubertal development. Results of examinations of cranial nerves II through XII were normal. The patient spoke clearly, and his gait, strength, sensation, and deep-tendon reflexes in the arms and legs were normal. The remainder of the examination was also normal. His initial laboratory studies revealed profound hypocalce-mia and hyperphosphatemia, but other laboratory test results were normal, including blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate amino-transferase, amylase, and lipase, as well as titers of antistreptolysin O and anti-DNase B; other test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with no acute ischemic changes. The corrected QT interval was reportedly mildly prolonged, at 471 msec. Because the patient had severe, symptomatic hypocalcemia, he was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit ICU for cardiovascular and respiratory monitoring and supportive care. On examination, he refused to swallow, had persistent burping, and stated, I dont want to die. The leg muscles were hypertonic. On examination performed by a pediatric endocrinology consultant, a mildly positive Chvosteks sign twitch-ing of the facial muscles was elicited on the left side in response to tapping on the region of the facial nerve anterior to the external auditory canal. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1b. ", "prediction": "1. Hypocalcemia: The patient's profound hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, along with a mildly prolonged QT interval, point towards hypocalcemia.\n2.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Lazaro V. Zayas Psychiatry: An 11-year-old girl was seen in an outpatient clinic of this hospital because of difficulty eating solid food and associated weight loss after an acute choking incident. The patient had been in her usual health until 14 days before this evaluation, when a piece of meat became stuck in an orthodontic palate expander that had been inserted 19 days earlier and she thought she might choke. She was able to dislodge the meat shortly thereafter, but during the next 7 days, she reportedly had an intense fear of swallowing, ate very carefully, and had an associated decrease in her food intake. On the 7th day after the choking incident, she stopped eating most solid foods; thereafter, she consumed only milkshakes, liquid dietary supplements, and, occasionally, yogurt and oatmeal. She reported that she was unable to eat solid food because she was afraid I cant chew it up enough to swallow it so I dont choke and I dont really know how to chew like I used to. One day before this evaluation, her orthodontist removed the palate expander. However, the swallowing difficulty persisted; she was unable to swallow small pieces of chicken or a single grain of rice. On the day of this evaluation, the patient consumed only a spoonful of oatmeal which she had previously been willing to eat, a half can of a liquid dietary supplement, and a small amount of water and juice. Her parents noted that she chewed food with her front teeth but appeared to be unable to move the food from the front of her mouth to the back to swallow it. Her weight had decreased by 1.4 kg since an examination performed 2 months earlier, and the body-mass index BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was below the 1st percentile. Her parents were worried about acute malnutrition and dehydration. They requested an urgent evaluation in the Eating Disorders Clinical and Research Program outpatient clinic at this hospital, and from there, the patient was referred to the Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine clinic at this hospital. During a psychiatric evaluation of the patient, her parents reported that she had been a highly selective eater since infancy, had cried the first time she ate solid food, and had frequently required coaxing from her parents to complete meals. The patient disliked many foods including artichokes, asparagus, meatballs, pasta sauce, hamburger buns, and sandwiches because of their taste or texture or because they were mixed together. These strict preferences had severely limited the available food choices for the familys dinners and affected the patients ability to socialize with friends. Her BMI had been as low as the one tenth percentile and had been consistently below the 1st percentile during recent years, including during her most recent examination 2 months earlier Fig. 1. Cypro-heptadine had been administered the previous year but was stopped after only transient improvement in her appetite because of lethargy. The patient did not report that she felt fat; she noted, If anything, I worry that Im too skinny. Im one of the smallest in my class, and she stated her desired weight to be average or a little lower than average. She reported no history of binge eating, self-induced vomiting, or use of laxatives, diuretics, or diet pills. She also reported no symptoms of pica or rumination disorder, depression, anxiety disorders, phobias besides fear of choking, substance abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention-deficithyperactivity disorder, or oppositional defiant disorder. As a young child, she had constipation, for which she had been seen by a gas-troenterologist at another hospital and had briefly received treatment with polyethylene glycol, fiber, and a stimulant laxative. She had been seen intermittently by nutritionists at another hospital since she was 6 years of age. At the other hospital, testing for celiac disease was reportedly negative. She took no medications currently and was allergic to penicillin, which had caused hives. She lived with her parents and younger siblings; she was a student who did well academically and had many friends and hobbies. There was a family history of depression. On medical examination, the temperature was 38C, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air; the blood pressure and pulse were 107/70 mm Hg and 114 beats per minute while she was in the supine position and 95/72 mm Hg and 123 beats per minute while she was standing. The weight was 26.5 kg, and the BMI 12.5. There were no oral petechiae, and sexual development was classified as Tanner stage 2 with stages ranging from 1 to 5 and higher stages indicating more advanced pubertal development; the remainder of the examination was normal. The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, platelet count, red-cell indexes, and results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, calcium, magnesium, total protein, globulin, and thyrotropin; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of higher than 1.030, a pH of 6.0, and 4 ketones and 1 protein by dipstick. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 110 beats per minute, with a PR interval of 116 msec, a corrected QT interval of 422 msec, and evidence of an incomplete right bundle-branch block. The patient was admitted to this hospital. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Avoidant–restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID).

Spera Neurology: A 53-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis was admitted to this hospital because of progressive asymmetric hypoesthesia and weakness in the legs. The patient had been in her usual health until 4 months before this admission, when hypoesthesia developed in the lateral aspect of the left foot. During the following 2 days, the hypoesthesia spread to involve the toes and midfoot. On evaluation by her primary care physician, the patient reported that her chronic low-back pain, which radiated to the buttocks, had increased in intensity, but there was no pain in the legs, fever, weight loss, or bowel or bladder changes. On neurologic examination, perception of light touch and pinprick was absent on the left toes and left forefoot; the remainder of the examination was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and blood levels of vitamin B12, glycated hemoglobin, and thyrotropin were normal. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation. During the next 5 days, hypoesthesia progressed to involve the proximal portion of the left foot, as well as the ankle and the lateral lower leg. The patient was evaluated in the outpatient neurology clinic, where she reported gradual progression of hypoesthesia involving the left leg but no pain or bowel or bladder incontinence. She was alert, cooperative, and articulate; she appeared well and was afebrile. Results of cranial-nerve examinations were normal although the first cranial nerve was not tested. Strength was 4 out of 5 during flexion and extension of the toes on the left foot, dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of the left ankle, ever-sion and inversion of the left foot, and flexion of the left knee; otherwise, strength was 5 out of 5. Perception of vibration was markedly diminished at the left hallux. Perception of light touch and pinprick was decreased on the left foot and the left lateral leg. Deep-tendon reflexes of the arms and legs were normal. The plantar reflex was flexor on the right side and absent on the left side. The remainder of the examination was normal. The patient was referred for nerve-conduction studies. Dr. Michael P. Bowley: Seven days later 3 months before this admission, nerve-conduction studies were performed. The sensory and motor responses were normal and symmetric, and F-wave minimal latencies in the tibial nerves were normal. Hoffmans reflex or H reflex, which is the electro-physiological correlate of the Achilles deep-tendon reflex was absent at the left soleus and normal at the right soleus. Needle electromyography of the left leg showed diminished recruitment of long-duration, polyphasic motor-unit potentials in proximal and distal muscles of the L5 myotome. Results of electromyography of the right leg were normal. On the basis of these findings, imaging studies were obtained. Dr. William A. Mehan, Jr.: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the lumbar spine, performed with and without the administration of contrast material, revealed disk protrusions, hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum, and facet arthropa-thy, processes that resulted in neural foraminal narrowing that was moderate on the left side at the level of L4L5 and moderate to severe on both sides at the level of L5S1. Nerve roots between the L3 and S1 levels had a thickened and clumped appearance and showed enhancement on contrast-enhanced images Fig. 1. Distal to the dorsal-root ganglia, the peripheral nerves were symmetric and did not show enhancement. Dr. Spera: A lumbar puncture was performed for cerebrospinal fluid CSF analysis. Oligoclonal banding was not present in concentrated CSF. Cytologic studies of the CSF showed increased lymphocytes that were polymorphous and occasionally reactive and appeared to be benign. Im-munophenotypic evaluation of the CSF did not reveal evidence of a monoclonal B-cell or unusual T-cell population; other test results are shown in Table 1. A provisional diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy was made, and intravenous immune globulin was administered 4 weeks and 1 week before the patient was admitted to this hospital. Despite the administration of intravenous immune globulin, symptoms in the left leg did not improve, and hypoesthesia and weakness developed in the right leg and progressed centripetally. The patient had several falls at home and began to use a cane, then a walker, and ultimately a wheelchair. When the patient was no longer able to stand from a seated position, she presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported episodes of bowel and bladder incontinence that she attributed to leg weakness interfering with her ability to walk to the bathroom quickly. She reported no fevers, weight loss, or night sweats. Rheumatoid arthritis had been diagnosed 18 months before this admission, and therapy with methotrexate and predni-sone had been initiated. Because of persistent disease activity, therapy with etanercept was initiated 7 months before this admission, after an interferon- release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis had been negative. On serial computed tomographic CT scans of the chest, there were subcentimeter pulmonary nodules in the bilateral lower lobes that had remained unchanged over a period of 4 years. The patient also had gastroesophageal reflux disease, uterine fibroids, and -thalassemia minor. Results of routine screening mammography performed 1 month before this admission were normal. Medications were omeprazole, methotrexate, prednisone, folic acid, gabapentin, and duloxetine. The patient had recently stopped taking etanercept, because she thought her progressive symptoms could be related to that medication. She resided in New England and worked in a health care environment in a nonclinical role. She had previously traveled to the southwestern United States. She was a current smoker with an 18-pack-year history of smoking, and she did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her sister had multiple sclerosis; there was no family history of cancer. On examination, the temperature was 36.3C, the blood pressure 168/78 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. Motor strength was 4 out of 5 in both legs and 4 out of 5 on both sides during hip flexion; the remainder of the motor examination was normal. Perception of vibration and temperature was markedly diminished in both legs from the toes to above the knees. Deep-tendon reflexes were 1 and symmetric at the patellae and were absent at the soleus. The plantar reflex was absent on both sides. The patient was unable to stand without assistance. Two firm, nontender subcutaneous nodules approximately 1 cm in diameter with overlying excoriations were present in the left submandibular area. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, C-reactive protein, and angiotensin-converting enzyme and results of kidney- and liver-function tests were normal. With the exception of the presence of a stable microcytic anemia, the complete blood count and white-cell differential count were normal. Blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus HIV type 1 p24 antigen, HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies, and Treponema pallidum were negative. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Mehan: MRI of the spine was performed with and without the administration of contrast material Fig. 2A and 2B. Contrast-enhanced images showed diffuse, irregular, abnormal hyper-intensity in the spinal cord that extended from T10 inferiorly to the conus; there was probable mild expansion of the spinal cord, diffuse abnormal signal throughout the spinal canal, marked thickening and enhancement of the nerve roots, and severe mass effect on the conus. MRI of the head was also performed with and without the administration of contrast material Fig. 2C and 2D. Contrast-enhanced images and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed abnormal diffuse hyperintensity in the sulci of both hemispheres with no leptomeningeal enhancement; there were periventricular patchy, ill-defined foci of enhancement on both sides. CT of the chest revealed no clinically significant change in the previously identified pulmonary nodules and no lymphadenopathy. Dr. Bowley: Repeat nerve-conduction studies revealed asymmetric attenuation in the amplitudes of sensory and motor responses which was worse on the left side than on the right and no evidence of primary demyelination. Electromyography showed abnormal spontaneous activity in the bilateral thoracic paraspinal muscles at the level of T8 and in the bilateral gluteus maximus, tensor fasciae latae, lateral gastrocne-mius, and right tibialis anterior muscles. Diffusely diminished recruitment of normal-appearing motor-unit potentials was observed in all the muscles tested in both legs. Dr. Spera: Repeat lumbar puncture was performed, and CSF analysis revealed a protein level of 4620 mg per deciliter and a glucose level lower than 2 mg per deciliter 0.1 mmol per liter. There were abundant lymphocytes that were polymorphous, enlarged, reactive, and atypical and were of uncertain clinical significance. Im-munophenotypic evaluation of the CSF revealed B cells with indeterminate surface and cytoplasmic expression of kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains; other test results are shown in Table 1. Fine-needle aspiration of one of the submandibular nodules was performed but yielded insufficient material for pathological evaluation. Three induced-sputum samples were negative for acid-fast bacteria. Urinary retention, absence of rectal tone, and saddle anesthesia loss of sensation in the area of the buttocks and perineum developed. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Lymphomatous meningitis, most likely due to primary leptomeningeal lymphoma. ", "prediction": "1. **Rheumatoid arthritis-associated myelopathy**: Given the patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and spinal cord lesions, inflammatory myelopathy related to rheumatoid arthritis is highly possible.\n\n2. **Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD)**: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and MRI findings could suggest NMOSD, which often presents with transverse myelitis.\n\n3. **Multiple sclerosis**: Family history of multiple sclerosis and periventricular patchy foci observed on MRI are consistent with presentation of MS, despite the absence of oligoclonal bands.\n\n4. **Paraneoplastic syndrome**: Given her history as a smoker and the presence of subcutaneous nodules, a paraneoplastic neurological syndrome could manifest with similar symptoms.\n\n5. **Infectious myelitis**: Despite negative HIV and Treponema pallidum tests, other infections (e.g., fungal, viral) could cause spinal cord inflammation, paraspinal muscle involvement, and CNS hyperintensity on MRI.\n\n6. **Sarcoidosis**: The presence of pulmonary nodules and elevated ACE levels, combined with multi-system involvement, might suggest neurosarcoidosis.\n\n7. **Vitamin B12 deficiency**: Despite normal initial B12 levels, B12 deficiency can occasionally present later with similar neurological deficits.\n\n8. **Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)**: Though ALS usually lacks sensory deficits, the asymmetric motor neuron degeneration and diffuse recruitment patterns on EMG do raise a flag for ALS.\n\n9. **Medication-induced neuropathy**: Methotrexate and Etanercept, used to treat her rheumatoid arthritis, could lead to drug-induced neurotoxicity, causing similar symptoms.\n\n10. **Vasculitis**: Systemic vasculitis, possibly related to her autoimmune condition, could affect the nervous system, presenting with asymmetric sensory and motor disturbances and MRI findings consistent with this condition."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Robert H. Goldstein Medicine: A 48-year-old man was seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of confusion. The week before this presentation, the patient, who was a lawyer, had traveled alone to Mexico for vacation. His family reported that he seemed to be in his usual health before the trip but that, when they spoke with him by telephone while he was in Mexico 4 days before this presentation, he seemed euphoric and easily distracted, which were notable changes from baseline. They were then unable to reach him by telephone for 72 hours and became increasingly concerned about his well-being. Ultimately, he was reached by telephone; he was agitated and refused to board his scheduled return flight. The patients mother traveled from the United States to Mexico, where she found the patient to be confused and unkempt and to have lost his wallet and passport; he was drinking alcohol and insisting that he needed to travel immediately to New York City to work on an important legal case. His mother escorted him on a flight back to the United States and brought him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, family members reported that the patient had begun having unexplained weight loss approximately 1 year earlier. The patient reported a history of multiple nonmelanoma skin cancers that had been treated with cryotherapy; he had also adopted a diet low in added sugar, which he believed had led to improvement in the appearance of the skin lesions. He had undergone sigmoidoscopy 12 years earlier to remove a foreign body from the sigmoid colon. He took melatonin and was allergic to penicillin. He was single, lived alone in an urban area of New England, and frequently traveled to Mexico; he had sex with men and used condoms intermittently. He drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. There was no family history of dementia, stroke, seizure disorder, cancer, depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. On examination, the patient appeared thin and agitated. The temperature was 35.8C, the pulse 71 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/62 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while he was breathing ambient air. He was alert and oriented to which city he was in and to the year but not the month. When he was asked why he was in the emergency department, his response revealed anosognosia and confabulation. He had nonfluent aphasia and perseverated when speaking, but he had no dysarthria and was able to repeat words, name objects and the current president, and pantomime brushing his hair and teeth. He performed simple calculations accurately but was unable to perform two-part commands; he was slow when he spelled table and world backward and when he counted down from 100 in increments of 7. He could not provide abstract explanations for proverbs. Examination of the function of cranial nerves II through XII revealed left-eye ptosis, a finding that was also visible on the patients drivers license photograph, which had been taken in the remote past. There was intermittent twitching on the right side of the face. Pronator drift was present on the right side of the body; the motor examination was otherwise normal, as were examinations of sensation and deep-tendon reflexes. Fingernosefinger movements were smooth and accurate bilaterally after the patient understood the task. The stance and stride were normal, but the patient walked slowly and was unable to walk with a tandem gait or on his toes or heels. The Romberg test was negative. Examination of the skin revealed a purple-brown scaly papule 0.5 cm in diameter on the medial left knee Fig. 1A, a nonblanching purple-brown patch 1.5 cm in diameter on the medial aspect of the left palmar foot Fig. 1B, and purple macules on the hard and soft palates. There were also multiple erythematous scars, including one on the left arm with an area of hard scale at the periphery; a red plaque 3 cm in diameter on the chest with heaped-up central scale, hemorrhagic crust, and purulent discharge; a red plaque 4 cm in diameter on the left flank with focal areas of scale and brown crust; gritty papules on the face; a large scaly red plaque on the back; and flaky scale on the scalp. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The red-cell indexes, anion gap, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, vitamin B12, and thyrotropin.  Urinalysis showed 1+ leukocyte esterase, 1+ bacteria, a pH of 6.0, and a specific gravity of 1.014;  there were 3 to 5 red cells and 10 to 20 white cells per high-power field.  Urine and blood toxicology screens were negative.  Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.Dr.  R. Gilberto Gonzalez: Computed tomography of the head revealed ill-defined hypodensities in the white matter of the frontal lobes, which extended into the genu of the corpus callosum, and in the posterior periventricular white matter (Figure 2A).  There was also an extraaxial calcification (4 cm in diameter) overlying the right frontal lobe that was thought to possibly represent a partially calcified meningioma (Figure 2B).Dr.  Goldstein: Six hours after the patient arrived in the emergency department, he had a 2-minute episode of aphasia.  The temperature was 38.2°C.  Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir, and levetiracetam were administered intravenously, and additional imaging studies were obtained.  Dr. Gonzalez: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Figure 3). T2-weighted images showed an abnormal hyperintense signal in the frontoparietal white matter that was slightly more prominent in the right frontal lobe than in the left frontal lobe and that extended into the genu of the corpus callosum;  there was no local mass effect or abnormal restricted diffusion.  There was also a small exophytic hypointense lesion along the inner table of the right frontal bone that was suggestive of a small calcified meningioma, as well as mild bilateral prominence of the parotid glands, which had restricted diffusion.  Figure 3 MRI of the Head.  Dr. Goldstein: After the MRI, the patient had another 2-minute witnessed episode, during which he was staring, twitching, and unable to speak;  afterward, he seemed to be more confused than he had been previously.  A lumbar puncture was performed.  The opening pressure was 9 cm of water, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless, without xanthochromia.  Examination of the CSF revealed 4 red cells and 7 white cells per microliter, a white-cell differential count of 80% lymphocytes and 20% monocytes, a protein level of 97 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55), and a glucose level of 53 mg per deciliter (2.9 mmol per liter [reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter;  2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]).  Gram’s staining revealed moderate mononuclear cells, very rare polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and no organisms.  The patient was admitted to the hospital.  On examination, there was tender inguinal lymphadenopathy on the left side.  Diagnostic tests were performed. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) complicated by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encephalopathy. Basal-cell carcinoma. Kaposi’s sarcoma. ", "prediction": "1. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND): The patient's confusion, chronic skin lesions, weight loss, and high-risk sexual behavior suggest an underlying chronic HIV infection potentially leading to HAND.\n2. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): The patient's MRI findings of abnormal hyperintense signals in the white matter and immunocompromised status (suggested by chronic weight loss and skin lesions) are indicative of PML.\n3. Neurosyphilis: Considering his sexual history and progressive neurological symptoms including confusion and anosognosia, neurosyphilis remains a possible diagnosis.\n4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of alcohol use combined with confusion and episodic language disturbances raises the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy.\n5. Paraneoplastic encephalitis: The presence of multiple skin lesions along with rapidly progressing neurological symptoms warrants considering paraneoplastic causes.\n6. CNS lymphoma: Given the HIV risk factors, the white matter abnormalities on MRI, and rapidly worsening neurologic status, primary CNS lymphoma is a likely consideration.\n7. Tuberculosis meningitis: The patient’s travel history to Mexico, persistent confusion, and CSF findings with elevated protein can be attributed to TB meningitis.\n8. Autoimmune encephalitis: The acute onset of confusion, memory problems, and limbic system abnormalities on MRI suggest autoimmune encephalitis.\n9. Viral encephalitis: The episode of febrile illness, subsequent confusion, and MRI findings are consistent with a form of viral encephalitis, such as HSV encephalitis.\n10. Bacterial meningitis: The confusional state, fever upon presentation, and CSF findings with elevated protein levels suggest an ongoing bacterial meningitis, despite negative Gram stain."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Nkemdilim Mgbojikwe Medicine: A 21-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital during the winter because of fever, headache, and myalgias. The patient had been well until 4 days before this admission, when fever, chills, fatigue, malaise, retro-orbital headache, and photophobia developed. On presentation to a clinic affiliated with the university where she was a student, she reported that, 6 days earlier, she had returned from a trip to Indonesia. A blood-smear examination for malaria was negative, and the patient was advised to take acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Over the next 2 days, her symptoms worsened, and abdominal pain in the left lower quadrant and arthralgias affecting the knees developed. On the third day of illness, she presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On examination at the other hospital, the temperature was 41.0C. The blood lactic acid level and results of liver-function tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for heterophile antibodies, influenza, and Clostridium difficile were negative. Blood and urine specimens were obtained for culture, and a lumbar puncture was performed; on cerebrospinal fluid analysis, the white-cell and red-cell counts and protein and glucose levels were normal. Dr. Rydhwana Hossain: Chest radiography revealed no evidence of focal consolidation, pulmonary edema, or hilar adenopathy. Abdominal radiography revealed multiple air-filled loops of small bowel but no evidence of abnormal bowel dilatation, obstruction, or free air. Four hours later, computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed the presence of a few subcentimeter mesenteric lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant. There was no bowel-wall thickening, obstruction, ascites, or hepatosplenomegaly. The kidneys were heterogeneous in appearance. Dr. Mgbojikwe: Acetaminophen was administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. High temperatures persisted; cooling blankets were applied, and more than 7 liters of fluid were administered intravenously. On the second hospi-tal day, intravenous doxycycline and ceftriaxone were administered. Three blood-smear examinations for malaria, a stool culture for enteric pathogens, and a stool examination for ova and parasites were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. By the third hospital day, cough and mild chest pain had developed, and hypoxemia was reportedly present; supplemental oxygen was administered, initially through a nasal cannula at a flow rate of 4 liters per minute and then through a nonrebreather face mask at a flow rate of 15 liters per minute. Dr. Hossain: Repeat chest radiography revealed diffuse, hazy opacities, predominantly in the lower lobes, with new opacification of the left hemidiaphragm Fig. 1A. Dr. Mgbojikwe: Headache and photophobia persisted. A CT scan of the head was normal. Doxycycline was continued, ceftriaxone was discontinued, and vancomycin and piperacillin tazobactam were administered intravenously. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit ICU at the other hospital. In the ICU, the blood levels of lactic acid, amylase, lipase, and creatine kinase were normal, and tests for rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram and a transthoracic echocardiogram were normal. Furo-semide was administered intravenously, and the patient had 3 liters of urine output. Therapy with oral oseltamivir and a continuous intravenous infusion of sodium bicarbonate was begun, and the patient was transferred by helicopter to the medical ICU at this hospital. On admission to this hospital, the patient reported that fevers had occurred without periodicity and that photophobia, headache, and diffuse myalgias persisted. She had a history of anxiety and exercise-induced asthma and a remote history of tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. Her only medication was citalopram, and she had no known allergies. She was a college student and lived with roommates in a rural area of New England. Twenty-seven days before the onset of illness, she had returned from a 10-day trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands. Six days before the onset of illness, she had returned from a 16-day ecology tour in rural Indonesia; she had traveled through the United Arab Emirates in transit to Indonesia, and the passenger seated next to her on the flight from the United Arab Emirates to Indonesia coughed intermittently during the trip. The patient did not receive any vaccinations before the trip and did not take malaria prophylaxis. While she was in Indonesia, she used mosquito netting during sleep but received multiple mosquito bites. She drank boiled water and pasteurized milk and ate rice and beans, thoroughly cooked meat, and fruit that had been washed but not peeled. She visited jungles and plantations and had contact with elephants, a bovine calf, and a juvenile macaque. She also observed but did not have contact with cats, dogs, bats, chickens, and cattle. She swam in jungle streams, ponds, and a waterfall pool. She reported that at the midpoint of the trip, a mild, nonpainful, nonpruritic rash developed; the rash first appeared on the wrists, spread centripetally and became diffuse, and then resolved. She was monogamous with her boyfriend, and they used condoms inconsistently. She did not smoke tobacco, but she smoked marijuana occasionally and drank alcohol rarely. On examination, the patient was irritable and appeared tired. The temperature was 37.2C, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the blood pressure 112/57 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while she was receiving supplemental oxygen through a high-flow nasal cannula at a flow rate of 50 liters per minute, with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.5. She had a few petechiae on the palate, pal-pebral conjunctival injection, and mild neck stiffness. On auscultation of the chest, there were rales over both lung bases. There was mild, diffuse abdominal tenderness that was worst in the left lower quadrant, as well as a very faint blanching, macular rash on the thighs, arms, and lower abdomen Fig. 2. Application of a tourniquet to an arm for 5 minutes did not precipitate the development of petechiae. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The red-cell indexes, anion gap, and blood levels of glucose, lactic acid, lactate dehydrogenase, and lipase were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A rapid test for malaria antigen, a pregnancy test, and a polymerase-chain-reaction PCR test for influenza were negative. Urinalysis showed slightly cloudy yellow urine, with 1 ketones, 1 occult blood, a specific gravity of 1.012, and a pH of 5.0; on microscopic examination, amorphous crystals and mucin were present, and there were 0 to 2 red cells per high-power field, no white cells per high-power field, and 0 to 2 hyaline casts per low-power field. Dr. Hossain: Chest radiography revealed rapidly progressing confluent perihilar opacities that were more prominent on the left side than on the right side, as well as a new small pleural effusion on the left side (Figure 1B). The left hemidiaphragm was completely obscured, possibly because of consolidation or atelectasis. Dr. Mgbojikwe: A diagnostic test was performed. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Probable acute leptospirosis. ", "prediction": "1. Dengue Fever: Given the patient's history of travel to Indonesia, persistent high fever, myalgia, retro-orbital headache, and petechiae, dengue fever is a strong consideration even though no mention of a positive serology was made.\n2. Leptospirosis: The combination of high fever, myalgia, conjunctival injection, history of swimming in freshwater, and mild rash can be suggestive of leptospirosis.\n3. Rickettsial Disease: The patient's history of travel, use of mosquito netting, exposure to potential vectors, fever, rash, and systemic symptoms may point towards a rickettsial infection like scrub typhus or murine typhus.\n4. Chikungunya: Typical symptoms include high fever, myalgia, arthralgias, and rash, aligning well with the patient’s presentation and recent mosquito bites reported.\n5. Typhoid Fever: The patient's high fever, abdominal pain, and history of travel to a region where typhoid is endemic raises concern for typhoid fever, despite the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms typical of Salmonella.\n6. Tuberculosis: Given her exposure on a flight to a coughing passenger, and the progressive respiratory symptoms with abnormal chest radiographs, pulmonary tuberculosis should be considered.\n7. Viral Hepatitis: Despite normal liver-function tests, the gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, and travel history necessitate considering viral hepatitis, particularly hepatitis A or E.\n8. Malaria: Despite multiple negative tests, given the high endemicity in Indonesia and atypical presentations, malaria still warrants reconsideration.\n9. COVID-19: The timing and symptoms including fever, respiratory involvement, headache, and malaise are very suggestive of COVID-19.\n10. Acute HIV Infection: The patient's systemic symptoms and potential risk factors, includuing inconsistent use of condoms with her boyfriend, warrants consideration of an acute HIV seroconversion syndrome."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Katherine L. Tuttle Pediatrics: A 9-day-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of nonbilious vomiting, acidosis, and azotemia. The patient had been born at another hospital by induced vaginal delivery after 41 weeks 3 days of gestation. The pregnancy had been complicated by maternal obesity. The patient was placed with an adoptive family immediately after birth. Her birth mother had received prenatal care, and screening tests for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis B virus had been negative; a screening test for immunity to rubella virus was positive, as was a screening test for group B streptococcal colonization. Spontaneous rupture of membranes, which occurred 2 hours before birth, revealed meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and five doses of penicillin were administered before delivery. The 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were 8 and 9, respectively. At birth, the weight was 3.9 kg 87th percentile, the length 51.5 cm 80th percentile, and the head circumference 36.5 cm 85th percentile; the vital signs and physical examination were normal. A diet of organic cows milkbased infant formula with a probiotic was begun shortly after birth; the patient drank the formula avidly, and urine and stool output were normal for her age. The results of newborn blood-spot screening tests i.e., a panel of tests for multiple congenital diseases, primarily inborn errors of metabolism and screening tests for hearing ability and critical congenital heart disease were normal, and the patient received intramuscular vitamin K, erythromycin ophthalmic ointment, and a hepatitis B immunization before discharge. Five days before this admission, at a routine pediatric examination, the patients adoptive parents reported that she had been drinking 60 ml of formula every 3 to 4 hours, with some spit ups, and that she produced four yellow-brown stools each day. She appeared well, with mild jaundice, and was scheduled to return 10 days later for another routine appointment. One day before this admission, nonprojectile, nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting occurred after each feed. The baby was fussier and less active than usual and drank only 30 to 45 ml of formula per feed before falling asleep, as compared with the 90 to 105 ml per feed she had had the previous day. Her father called the pediatrician during the evening and was advised to take the baby to the emergency department at another hospital. On presentation to the other hospital, the patient was alert and responded appropriately to physical examination. The temperature was 37.8C, the pulse 120 beats per minute, the blood pressure 85/59 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 36 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 3.5 kg. The anterior fontanelle was sunken; the remainder of the examination was normal. A lumbar puncture was performed. Samples of blood, urine, stool, and cerebrospinal fluid were obtained for culture. Tests for respiratory syncy-tial virus and rotavirus were negative. Blood levels of total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed orange urine, with a pH of 5.0, a specific gravity higher than 1.030, 3 protein, and 2 bilirubin. A chest radiograph was normal. Multiple attempts to place an intravenous catheter were unsuccessful; ampicillin and ceftriaxone were administered intramuscularly, and an enteral electrolyte solution was administered through a nasogastric tube and did not cause vomiting. Early during the following day, the patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit ICU at this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. The patient had lived with her adoptive family in an urban area of New England since birth. Her biologic half-brother had autism and eczema and had undergone placement of tympanostomy tubes. The patient had no known exposure to sick persons. On admission to this hospital, the results of physical examination were unchanged. A peripheral intravenous catheter was inserted, and a bolus of normal saline was administered, followed by a continuous infusion of 10 dextrose in water with 0.225 normal saline. The point-of-care blood glucose level was 84 mg per deciliter 4.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 60 to 100 mg per deciliter 3.3 to 5.6 mmol per liter. Ampicillin and cefepime were administered intravenously. Tests for respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumo-virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza viruses were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was fed a cows milkbased formula, and vomiting recurred. Enteral feeding was stopped, the administration of intravenous fluid was continued, and vomiting ceased. The next day, the physical examination was normal. The results of an acylcarnitine profile analysis were normal, as were the results of blood amino acid analysis, with the exception of an alanine level of 582 nmol per milliliter reference range, 139 to 474. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine, with a pH of 6.0, a specific gravity of 1.008, and 1 glucose. An electrocardiogram was normal. Dr. Rene Balza: An upper gastrointestinal series showed severe spontaneous gastroesophageal reflux; there was no evidence of intestinal malrota-tion. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder revealed mild pyelectasis in the left kidney and was otherwise normal; limited abdominal ultra-sonography revealed no evidence of pyloric ste-nosis. Dr. Tuttle: The cultures of blood, urine, stool, and cerebrospinal fluid that had been performed at the other hospital remained negative, and am-picillin and cefepime were discontinued. Oral administration of an electrolyte solution was begun and did not cause vomiting. On the third hospital day, the patient was transferred to the pediatric unit. Her home diet of an organic cows milkbased formula with a probiotic was resumed. Overnight, she vomited once, approximately 2 hours after a feed. Vomiting after feeds continued during the next day. A diet of an oral electrolyte solution was resumed, and vomiting ceased. On the fifth hospital day, oral administration of an amino acidbased formula was begun and did not cause vomiting. The results of repeat newborn blood-spot screening tests were reported as normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Over the next 2 days, the patient continued to receive the amino acidbased formula without vomiting; the administration of intravenous fluid was stopped. Laboratory test results obtained on the sixth and seventh hospital days are shown in Table 1. The patient was discharged home on the seventh hospital day, at which time the weight was 3.4 kg. Three days after discharge, the patient was seen for follow-up by her pediatrician. Her parents reported that she had had five episodes of spitting up during the previous 24 hours, that she had appeared tired and pale, and that her oral intake had decreased, such that she had consumed only 5 to 25 ml of the amino acidbased formula per feed that day. She was also producing frequent loose, small-volume, greenish stools 10 in a 24-hour period; during the bowel movements, borborygmi were audible and the patient arched her back. On examination, the patient appeared pale and sleepy but aroused during the examination. The temperature was 37.3C, the pulse 132 beats per minute, and the weight 3.0 kg. The anterior fon-tanelle was sunken, the lips were dry, skin turgor was decreased, and the capillary refill time was between 2 and 3 seconds. The patient vomited once in the clinic. The point-of-care blood glucose level was 98 mg per deciliter 5.4 mmol per liter. The patient was fed an oral electrolyte solution and then was referred to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient was lethargic and her skin appeared ashen; she cried weakly and without tears. The temperature was 37.8C, the pulse 166 beats per minute, the blood pressure 73/50 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 58 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while she was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Samples of blood and stool were obtained for culture. Blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine, with a pH of 6.0, a specific gravity of 1.030, and 2 protein by dipstick; on microscopic examination, there were 0 to 2 red cells per high-power field, 5 to 10 white cells per high-power field, and 5 to 10 hyaline casts per low-power field. The patient was admitted to the pediatric ICU. A bolus of normal saline was administered intravenously, followed by a continuous infusion of 5 dextrose with sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride. The patient received an oral electrolyte solution without vomiting. Dr. Balza: The next day, a central venous cath-eter was placed; abdominal radiography, which was performed to assess its position, revealed an abnormal bowel-gas pattern with narrowing of the lumen and separation of the bowel loops, findings suggestive of bowel-wall thickening or asci-tes Fig. 1A. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed fluid-filled bowel loops with thickened walls measuring up to 3 mm in thickness, as well as a small amount of associated free intraperitoneal fluid in the right half of the abdomen Fig. 1B and 1C. Dr. Tuttle: Stools continued to be loose and were guaiac-positive. Enteral feeds were discontinued, and the administration of total parenteral nutrition was initiated. Pantoprazole, ampicillin, cefepime, and metronidazole were administered intravenously. Over the next 2 weeks, additional diagnostic studies were performed, and a diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome. ", "prediction": "1. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): Severe spontaneous gastroesophageal reflux observed in the upper gastrointestinal series, combined with recurrent vomiting after feeds, strongly suggests GERD.\n\n2. Milk Protein Allergy: The patient's symptoms improved with an amino acid-based formula and worsened on cow's milk-based formula, indicating a possible milk protein allergy.\n\n3. Pyloric Stenosis: Although ultrasonography did not reveal pyloric stenosis, the recurrent nonbilious vomiting and weight loss could initially suggest this condition.\n\n4. Metabolic Disorder: The presence of metabolic acidosis and azotemia, despite normal newborn blood-spot screening tests, warrants further investigation for a possible inborn error of metabolism.\n\n5. Volvulus/Malrotation: The abnormal bowel-gas pattern and bowel-wall thickening on imaging raise concerns for volvulus or malrotation, necessitating further evaluation.\n\n6. Infectious Enteritis: The guaiac-positive stools, elevated white cells in urine, and thickened bowel walls may be due to an infectious etiology, which should be considered despite negative initial cultures.\n\n7. Renal Tubular Acidosis: The patient’s acidosis, high urine specific gravity, and recurrent vomiting could be indicative of renal tubular acidosis.\n\n8. Dehydration: The signs of decreased skin turgor, dry lips, and low urine output are consistent with significant dehydration as a secondary diagnosis.\n\n9. Sepsis: While cultures were negative, the patient’s lethargic state, elevated white cells, and response to broad-spectrum antibiotics justify consideration of neonatal sepsis.\n\n10. Volvulus: The imaging findings of bowel-wall thickening and separation of bowel loops could be indicative of volvulus, a serious condition requiring immediate attention."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Rajitha Venkatesh Pediatrics: An 8-month-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of fever and an abdominal mass. The patient had been in her usual good health until approximately 6 days before admission, when she passed a large stool surrounded by clotted blood. During the next 4 days, she had intermittent fevers with associated irritability, as well as decreased oral intake without emesis. She continued to produce 6 to 8 wet diapers per day and to pass soft, brown stools. During the day before admission, a mild cough developed. The patient was evaluated in the office of her pediatrician, and abdominal ultrasonography was scheduled for the next day. That evening, her temperature rose to 40.3C; her parents administered ibuprofen and took her to the emergency department of another hospital. On examination at the other hospital, the patient appeared to be in mild discomfort. The temperature was 39.4C, the blood pressure 102/58 mm Hg, the pulse 170 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 9.53 kg 93rd percentile. The fontanelle was open, soft, and flat. The abdomen was moderately distended, with normal bowel sounds and no apparent tenderness on palpation; the remainder of the examination was normal. Acetaminophen was administered, and the temperature decreased to 36.1C. Analysis of a urine specimen obtained by means of catheterization revealed a pH of 5.0, a specific gravity of 1.005, a small amount of blood, and a urobilinogen level of 0.2 mg per deciliter and was otherwise normal. A blood specimen could not be obtained. Dr. Michael S. Gee: Abdominal radiography Fig. 1A, performed with the patient in an upright position, revealed the absence of bowel gas in the midabdomen and peripheral displacement of multiple bowel loops, findings suggestive of an abdominal mass; there was a nonobstructive bowel-gas pattern and no free intra-peritoneal air or abnormal calcifications. Abdominal ultrasonography Fig. 1B revealed a large, thick-walled complex cystic mass in the midabdomen that had internal dependent debris and multiple mural satellite cysts. The mass was located predominantly to the left of the midline, displaced the left kidney laterally, and did not have internal vascularity on Doppler imaging. Dr. Venkatesh: The patient was transferred to this hospital 4.5 hours after her arrival at the other hospital. The patient had been born after an uncomplicated gestation of 41 weeks duration. When she was 6.25 months of age 7.5 weeks before this evaluation, she was seen in the emergency department of the other hospital because she had four episodes of vomiting over a 3-hour period; she had associated grunting that was suggestive of abdominal pain but had no constipation, fever, or bleeding. On examination at that time, she was afebrile and weighed 8.15 kg 84th percentile; she had mild abdominal distention and voluntary guarding but had no palpable mass or organo-megaly. Abdominal radiography revealed a nonspecific bowel-gas pattern. She was able to receive several feedings without complication, and she returned home. The patients childhood immunizations were current. She took no medications and had no known allergies. She lived with her parents, a sibling, and other relatives. Her maternal grandfather had had colon cancer, and a paternal aunt had died at 20 years of age because of cancer that had been initially manifested by an abdominal cyst; there was no family history of inflammatory bowel disease. On examination, the patient was fussy but consolable. The temperature was 36.3C, the blood pressure 105/52 mm Hg, the pulse 122 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while she was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft and distended. On palpation, there was a firm fullness above the pubis but no discrete mass. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Blood levels of glucose, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, lactate dehydrogenase, uric acid, amylase, alpha feto-protein, and human chorionic gonadotropin were normal, as were the results of coagulation and liver-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. A blood culture was obtained. Dr. Gee: Computed tomography CT of the abdomen Fig. 2A and 2B, performed in accordance with a pediatric low dose protocol after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed a complex cystic mass measuring 14.5 cm in greatest dimension in the midabdomen. The mass filled the left side of the abdomen and was separate from the bowel. Several loculations of the cyst abutted the pancreatic body and tail. The mass did not contain enteric contrast material, and the attenuation values of the contents of the mass were consistent with fluid. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage of the cystic mass was performed with the use of an 8-French pigtail catheter Fig. 2C. A 500-ml sample of cloudy fluid was aspirated and sent for microbiologic, hematologic, and chemical analysis. Then, iodinated contrast material was injected through the drainage catheter to identify sites of communication with the cystic mass. On fluoroscopic images obtained during the injection Fig. 2D, a curvilinear branching structure adjacent to the cyst cavity was filled with contrast material. A CT scan was obtained immediately after the injection Fig. 2E and 2F to determine the anatomical location of this structure. During CT, only the necessary amount of radiation was used, in accordance with the Image Gently principles outlined by the Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging.1 Because this was a follow-up examination targeted to a specific anatomical region, a specific pediatric low dose technique was used; the resultant effective dose was 1 mSv, which is equivalent to less than 1 year of background exposure. The findings on CT confirmed that the curvilinear structure filled with contrast material was the pancreatic duct Fig. 2E. In addition, contrast material was seen in the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum Fig. 2F; it had presumably passed through the ampulla. Dr. Venkatesh: Metronidazole, gentamicin, ampi-cillin, and fluids were administered intravenously, and acetaminophen was administered as needed for fevers. During the next 2 days, the patient continued to have low-grade fevers. Diagnostic procedures were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Congenital pancreatic cyst. ", "prediction": "1. Pancreatic pseudocyst: The large, thick-walled cystic mass with internal debris adjacent to the pancreatic duct suggests a potential pancreatic pseudocyst.\n\n2. Mesenteric cyst: Given the location and ultrasound findings of a complex cystic mass in the abdomen, a mesenteric cyst is a consideration.\n\n3. Enteric duplication cyst: The presence of a cystic mass near the gastrointestinal tract raises the possibility of an enteric duplication cyst.\n\n4. Ovarian cyst: Even though less common in this age group, an ovarian cyst can present as an abdominal mass and should be considered.\n\n5. Neuroblastoma: The child's abdominal mass and fever could point towards neuroblastoma, a common pediatric neoplasm that can present with a mass and systemic symptoms.\n\n6. Wilms' tumor: As a common pediatric renal tumor, a Wilms' tumor could present with an abdominal mass, though usually confined to the kidney.\n\n7. Hemorrhagic cyst: Considering the stool surrounded by clotted blood, a hemorrhagic cyst, possibly with subsequent infection, remains a differential.\n\n8. Hydatid cyst: Though rare, a hydatid cyst caused by Echinococcus infection could present with a similar cystic abdominal mass.\n\n9. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST): While uncommon, a GIST could present as a large abdominal mass distinct from the bowel with the noted imaging characteristics.\n\n10. Adrenal hemorrhage: The complex cystic nature of the mass, along with high fever and prior vomiting episodes, can potentially correlate with adrenal hemorrhage, especially in neonates and infants."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Max W. Adelman Medicine: A 45-year-old man with Tourettes syndrome and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for the management of hydrocephalus was admitted to this hospital because of headache and fever. The patient had been well until 3 days before admission, when he awoke with a severe, diffuse, pounding headache. He noted that the pain was similar to pain he had had in association with the malfunction of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt 24 years earlier. The patient took ibuprofen but had no symptom relief. Fevers, anorexia, fatigue, and mild nausea also developed. The evening before admission, he presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On evaluation, the patient rated his headache as 8 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain. On examination, the temperature was 37.6C, the pulse 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 96/56 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while he was breathing ambient air. He appeared well, and the findings on a general physical examination were normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Efren J. Flores: Computed tomography CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed the presence of a right frontal ventriculoperitoneal shunt, which tunneled across the vertex and inferiorly down the left side of the scalp, without an apparent reservoir, and terminated just superior to the third ventricle. There was no evidence of hydrocephalus; the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles were not apparent, and the right lateral ventricle had a prominent temporal horn that abutted a region of temporo-occipital hypoden-sity and encephalomalacia. In addition, a series of radiographs, which were obtained to assess the position and function of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt, revealed several remnants of the shunt catheter in the left thorax, as well as a large mass in the right hilum. Dr. Adelman: Acetaminophen was administered orally, and normal saline, fentanyl, and ondansetron were administered intravenously. The following day, the patient was transferred by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital for further treatment. While the patient was in the ambulance, his temperature rose to 39.2C and the headache persisted. Morphine was administered. On arrival in the emergency department, the patient reported that the severity of his headache had decreased. Several weeks earlier, he had not passed an eye examination for a drivers license because of poor peripheral vision. He had Tourettes syndrome and a cyst of the posterior fossa that was associated with hydrocephalus, which had been managed with ventriculoperitoneal shunting since childhood. He had undergone five shunt revisions; the most recent had been performed 24 years earlier because of shunt malfunction. He took no medications and had no known allergies. He lived with his girlfriend in New England, where he was employed in the shipbuilding industry; he enjoyed spending time outdoors and worked part-time as a nature guide. He was monogamous with his girlfriend, drank an average of four beers weekly, and did not use tobacco or illicit drugs. He had not recently traveled outside New England and had no known exposure to sick persons or tick bites. There was no family history of cancer. On examination, the temperature was 39.2C, the pulse 81 beats per minute, the blood pressure 121/79 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95 while the patient was breathing ambient air. Left hom-onymous hemianopsia was present; the remainder of the general examination was unchanged. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Morphine and lorazepam were administered intravenously, and a lumbar puncture was performed with the patient in the left lateral decu-bitus position. The opening pressure was 24 cm of water, and the cerebrospinal fluid was clear and colorless, with a protein level of 124 mg per deciliter reference range, 5 to 55 and a glucose level of 49 mg per deciliter 2.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter 2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter and with three nucleated cells and no blood cells per microliter. Grams staining did not reveal any microorganisms; a specimen was sent for bacterial culture. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained, and vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir were administered intravenously. The patient was admitted to the hospital. On physical examination the following morning, nontender lymphadenopathy was noted in the cervical, postauricular, supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinal regions. The spleen was not enlarged, and the temperature ranged from 36.4C to 38.0C. The examination was otherwise unchanged. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed cloudy, amber urine, with a specific gravity of 1.017, a pH of 5.0, and 2 urobilinogen by dipstick. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear for parasites was negative. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Flores: Abdominal ultrasonography revealed several well-circumscribed, avascular, hypoechoic lesions abutting the pancreatic head that were thought to represent enlarged lymph nodes, as well as an exophytic, hypoechoic lesion 2 cm in diameter at the lower pole of the left kidney. A single-view radiograph of the chest Fig. 1A showed a fragmented ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter on the left side. In addition, there was widening of the mediastinum and bilateral hilar nodular thickening. These findings are consistent with underlying mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Subsequently, CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast material Fig. 1B through 1G. Axial images of the chest obtained with a soft-tissue window setting showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy involving several nodal stations, including the prevascular, aortopulmonary, right paratracheal, and right lower paratracheal regions. Images of the chest obtained with the lung window setting showed volume loss of the right middle lobe and atelec-tasis due to right hilar lymphadenopathy, which partially narrows the bronchus intermedius and partially obstructs the bronchus of the right middle lobe. A coronal image of the abdomen and pelvis obtained with a soft-tissue window setting showed extensive retroperitoneal and left inguinal lymphadenopathy, and axial images showed retroperitoneal and left external iliac lymphadenopathy and infiltrative left renal lesions. Dr. Adelman: Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir were stopped. The headache persisted, and fevers continued. Morphine and acetaminophen were administered, and the patient had symptom relief. On the third hospital day, the patient continued to feel unwell and had night sweats. Fevers to a temperature of 38.3°C continued. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Manual review of the peripheral-blood smear by a hematopathologist was requested, and flow cytometry was performed. Dr. Aliyah R. Sohani: Examination of the peripheral-blood smear (Figure 2A, 2B, and 2C) revealed atypical polymorphous lymphoid cells with round-to-irregular nuclei, some with nucleoli, and moderate-to-abundant cytoplasm; a few cytoplasmic granules were present in some of the cells. Plasmacytoid lymphocytes and occasional plasma cells were also present; no blasts were seen. Some neutrophils appeared to be hypogranulated, and large platelets were present. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood revealed a differential count of 35% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, and 54% granulocytes, as well as 3% polyclonal B cells, 27% CD3+ T cells (with no immunophenotypic abnormalities), 4% natural killer (NK) cells, 1.5% CD3+CD16+CD57+CD8+ T cells, and no myeloid or lymphoid blasts. There was a markedly inverted ratio of CD4 cells to CD8 cells of 0.08 (Figure 2D). Dr. Adelman: Diagnostic tests were performed. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Acute Epstein–Barr virus infection (infectious mononucleosis). ", "prediction": "1. Tuberculous meningitis: Fever, headache, lymphadenopathy, and CSF results with elevated protein and low glucose are consistent with tuberculous meningitis.\n2. Lymphoma: Persistent fevers, night sweats, widespread lymphadenopathy, and abnormal findings on peripheral blood smear suggest a hematologic malignancy such as lymphoma.\n3. Neurosarcoidosis: Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, non-caseating granulomas, and neurological symptoms are indicative of neurosarcoidosis.\n4. Bacterial ventriculitis: Headache, fever, and a history of ventriculoperitoneal shunting raise the possibility of shunt-related infection.\n5. Viral meningitis: Fever, headache, and mild CSF pleocytosis with a predominantly lymphocytic response can be due to viral meningitis.\n6. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): Fever, lymphadenopathy, and neurological symptoms could be seen in SLE, especially with systemic involvement.\n7. Fungal infection: Immunocompromised states, prolonged fever, and lymphadenopathy with widespread lesions can suggest a systemic fungal infection.\n8. HIV infection: Inverted CD4/CD8 ratio, lymphadenopathy, and persistent fevers necessitate consideration of HIV infection.\n9. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH): Fever, splenomegaly, and blood smear abnormalities suggest HLH, which can present with multi-organ involvement.\n10. Metastatic cancer: Widespread lymphadenopathy, splenic lesions, and persistent constitutional symptoms raise the possibility of metastasis from an unknown primary cancer."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Robert H. Goldstein Medicine: A 63-year-old woman was admitted to the intensive care unit ICU of this hospital because of fever, hypotension, and hypoxemia. Five months before the current admission, weakness of the proximal muscles of the arms and dyspnea on exertion developed in the patient. One month later, she was admitted to this hospital with worsening symptoms. Follicular erythema-tous papules were present on the lateral aspect of both hips, and the blood creatine kinase level was 1856 U per liter reference range, 40 to 150. A skin biopsy of the lesions on the lateral hips revealed interface dermatitis. A diagnosis of dermatomyositis was made. An interferon- release assay for Myco-bacterium tuberculosis was negative, and treatment with prednisone and azathioprine was initiated, along with trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. An extensive evaluation for cancer  including mammography, computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis, trans-vaginal ultrasonography, colonoscopy, and a Papanicolaou smear  was unrevealing. After the initiation of prednisone and azathioprine therapy, the blood creatine kinase level decreased to 683 U per liter, and the patient had a temporary mild increase in strength. Despite the initial improvement of the patients symptoms, the proximal muscle weakness gradually worsened and the blood creatine kinase level increased during the next several weeks. Dyspnea on exertion progressed, and when the patient was chewing, she noted fatigue in the muscles of her jaw and neck. Three months before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by her rheumatologist and reported severe dyspnea at rest. She was readmitted to this hospital for further evaluation, and additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Melissa C. Price: CT of the chest was performed during expiration and after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Bilateral ground-glass opacities in a mosaic distribution were present, and there was no consolidation Fig. 1. Dr. Goldstein: To further assess the worsening dyspnea on exertion and the abnormalities seen on imaging studies of the chest, pulmonary-function testing was performed. The forced expi-ratory volume in one second FEV1, forced vital capacity FVC, and ratio of FEV1 to FVC were normal, as were the total lung capacity, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, and maximal respiratory muscle strength. The patient reported difficulty swallowing, and a diagnosis of aspiration was considered. A video swallow study showed only mild oropha-ryngeal dysphagia and no evidence of aspiration. Because the patient had ongoing proximal muscle weakness despite treatment for dermato-myositis, a diagnosis of glucocorticoid-induced myopathy was considered and additional testing was performed. Needle electromyography revealed abnormal spontaneous activity that was suggestive of ongoing muscle injury in the left deltoid and left vastus lateralis muscles, and magnetic resonance imaging of the left leg revealed extensive muscle edema and enhancement that were consistent with myositis, as well as focal nonenhancing areas that were suggestive of necrosis. Despite treatment with high-dose methylpred-nisolone and intravenous immune globulin IVIG, the proximal muscle weakness and dyspnea persisted. Treatment with rituximab was initiated. The proximal muscle weakness and dyspnea diminished, and on hospital day 10, the patient was discharged; prednisone and azathioprine were continued. Three weeks later, she was evaluated by her rheumatologist and reported improvement in her weakness and dyspnea; the dose of prednisone was tapered from 60 mg to 40 mg daily. One month before the current admission, dysphagia increased and new weakness of the distal muscles of the arms developed in the patient. Repeat electromyography of the arms revealed persistent myopathy in the proximal muscles and new myopathy in the distal muscles. A muscle biopsy was performed. Pathological evaluation of a biopsy specimen of the right quadriceps muscle revealed an active inflammatory myopathy, and electron microscopy revealed tubuloreticular inclusions in endothelial cells, a finding supportive of the diagnosis of dermato-myositis. The dose of prednisone was increased, and the patient was again treated with IVIG. On the day of the current admission to this hospital, the patient was seen in the rheumatol-ogy clinic and then referred to the emergency department for evaluation because of a 2-day history of increasing fatigue, chills, night sweats, increased dysphagia, and a new productive cough. The patient reported no dysuria, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or headache. She had a history of glaucoma and hypothyroidism. Ten years earlier, she had been treated with a 6-month course of isoniazid for latent tuberculosis, which had been diagnosed with the use of tuberculin skin testing. In addition to prednisone and azathioprine, her medications included levothyroxine, liothyro-nine, and a multivitamin. She had received the last infusion of rituximab 10 weeks earlier. Her mother had myasthenia gravis, and multiple family members had had lung cancer. She worked as a health care provider, lived in New England, and had traveled to California but not outside the United States. On examination, the temperature was 39.3C, the blood pressure 85/47 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 87 while the patient was breathing ambient air. Supplemental oxygen was delivered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 to 6 liters per minute, with adjustment to keep the oxygen saturation above 93. The patient was awake and alert but appeared generally unwell. The first and second heart sounds were normal, without murmurs, and there was no jugular venous distention. Crackles were present in the lower lung fields. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft, nondistended, and nontender on palpation. The liver and spleen were not palpable. The arms and legs had no edema, and muscle bulk was diffusely decreased. Strength was symmetric and graded as 4 out of 5 in the proximal and distal muscles of the arms, 4 out of 5 in the proximal muscles of the legs, and 5 out of 5 in the distal muscles of the legs. Deep-tendon reflexes were diffusely hypoactive in the arms and knees and normal at the ankles. Cultures of urine and blood had no growth. Testing of a nasal swab for influenza A and B nucleic acids was negative. A screening test for human immunodeficiency virus HIV type 1 p24 antigen and HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies was negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph showed a patchy linear opacity at the base of the left lung. Intravenous fluids, high-dose methylprednisolone, vancomycin, and cefepime were administered, and the patient was admitted to the ICU while she received a continuous infusion of norepinephrine. Azathioprine was discontinued, and atovaquone was substituted for trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. The blood pressure improved. Norepinephrine and methylprednisolone were discontinued, pred-nisone was resumed, and the patient was transferred to the medical unit. Vancomycin and cefepime were continued. The patients need for supplemental oxygen to maintain 93 saturation varied from 1 liter delivered through a nasal cannula to 10 liters delivered through a face tent. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Price: CT of the chest, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new consolidations in the dependent portion of the bilateral lower lobes and inferior lingula. In addition, new interlobular septal thickening, bilateral ground-glass opacities, and trace bilateral pleural effusions were present. Subpleural reticulations were seen in the lower lobes. There was no intrathoracic lymphadenopa-thy Fig. 2. Dr. Goldstein: A repeat video swallow study was obtained on hospital day 8 because of concerns about possible aspiration pneumonia. There was moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia and intermittent trace aspiration. The patient had no fever for 3 days, but on hospital day 5, the temperature rose to 39.6C. During the next 3 days, high temperatures persisted despite continued treatment with vancomy-cin and cefepime. Cultures of urine and blood were sterile; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Diagnostic tests were performed, and a diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Cytomegalovirus pneumonitis. ", "prediction": "1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's history of dysphagia and recent aspiration episodes, along with new chest CT findings, suggests recurrent aspiration pneumonia.\n2. Dermatomyositis Flare: The persistent myopathy, worsening muscle weakness, and elevated creatine kinase levels despite treatment indicate a possible aggressive progression or flare of dermatomyositis.\n3. Sepsis: The combination of fever, hypotension, and the need for norepinephrine infusions points towards a systemic infection leading to sepsis.\n4. Interstitial Lung Disease: The bilateral ground-glass opacities and subpleural reticulations on CT are consistent with interstitial lung disease, which can be associated with dermatomyositis.\n5. Glucocorticoid-Induced Myopathy: Chronic steroid use can lead to muscle weakness and myopathy, exacerbating the patient's underlying dermatomyositis.\n6. Bacterial Pneumonia: The patient has new pulmonary consolidations and ground-glass opacities on CT, which, along with persistent high fever despite antibiotics, suggests a bacterial pneumonia.\n7. Drug-Induced Pneumonitis: The patient's immunosuppressive regimen, including recent rituximab and azathioprine, could contribute to drug-induced pneumonitis presenting as bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.\n8. Opportunistic Infection: The immunosuppressive therapy places the patient at risk for opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, despite prophylaxis.\n9. Viral Pneumonitis: Given the negative bacterial cultures and the persistent fever, a viral pneumonitis remains a possibility even with a negative preliminary panel, considering other viruses could be involved.\n10. Pulmonary Embolism: Although less likely given the clinical picture, the patient's acute hypoxemia and dyspnea warrant consideration of pulmonary embolism, especially with the risk of venous thromboembolism in prolonged glucocorticoid use."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. David M. Dudzinski: A 32-year-old man was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital for the abrupt onset of postprandial chest pain. Several hours before presentation, the patient had eaten pizza in his apartment. Less than 1 hour later, while he was at rest and watching television, crushing pain, diaphoresis, dyspnea, and nausea developed. He rated the pain at 7 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain, and he noted that the pain did not radiate or worsen with respiration. He attempted to induce vomiting and took calcium carbonate tablets, but his condition did not improve. After 2 hours of constant pain, he presented to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient had no medical history and took no medications. His father had had a myocardial infarction when he was 51 years of age. The patient was allergic to penicillin unknown reaction. He lived with his girlfriend, who had recently had streptococcal pharyngitis. He had been under a great deal of stress because of a new job as a sales manager, a move to a new apartment, and the recent death of a family pet. He consumed a six-pack of beer daily. He had used cocaine most recently 3 months earlier but did not report using other illicit substances. On examination, the temperature was 36.3C, the heart rate 83 beats per minute, the blood pressure 158/81 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 26.9. He appeared to be anxious and uncomfortable and had diapho-resis. The jugular venous pressure was 6 cm of water with a normal waveform. There was no evidence of a heart murmur or rub. When the patient was asked to indicate the location of the pain, he pointed to the subxiphoid area; there was some tenderness in that area on palpation. The stool was guaiac negative. The remainder of the examination was normal. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of greater than 1.040 and was otherwise normal. A urine toxicology screen revealed can-nabinoids, and a blood toxicology screen was negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed concave ST-segment elevations 1 to 2 mm in the inferior leads and V3  through V6  precordial leads, along with a PR-segment elevation in lead aVR and possible subtle PR-segment depressions Fig. 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Matthew P. Moy: A chest radiograph was normal. The lungs were clear, and there was no evidence of pneumothorax, cardiomegaly, or mediastinal widening. Dr. Dudzinski: Aspirin, clopidogrel, intravenous morphine sulfate, lorazepam, ranitidine, alu-minum hydroxidediphenhydraminelidocaine magnesium hydroxide, and intravenous infusions of heparin and nitroglycerin were administered, and emergency coronary angiography was ar-ranged. A diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Acute cholecystitis. ", "prediction": "1. Acute Pericarditis: The ECG findings showing concave ST-segment elevations and PR-segment changes are classic indicators of pericarditis.\n2. Acute Myocardial Infarction: Given his presentation with crushing chest pain, dyspnea, and diaphoresis, a myocardial infarction remains a major concern especially with his family history.\n3. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The temporal relationship between the postprandial state and the onset of symptoms, as well as relief attempts with calcium carbonate, suggest a possible GERD-related cause.\n4. Panic Attack: Symptoms such as anxiety, chest pain, diaphoresis, and dyspnea could be attributable to a severe panic attack, particularly under his current lifestyle stressors.\n5. Cocaine-Induced Chest Pain: Despite the last reported use being 3 months ago, cocaine can cause significant cardiovascular complications including vasospasm and chest pain.\n6. Musculoskeletal Pain: The tenderness in the subxiphoid area and the lack of pain radiation or association with respiration indicate the possibility of a musculoskeletal origin.\n7. Myocarditis: Viral infections can lead to myocarditis, which may present with chest pain and general discomfort, and his recent exposure to streptococcal pharyngitis could be a causal factor.\n8. Esophageal Spasm: Characterized by sudden, severe chest pain after eating, esophageal spasms could match his symptoms, especially in the absence of other gastrointestinal findings.\n9. Acute Pancreatitis: Postprandial chest pain radiating to the back and tenderness in the upper abdomen point to pancreatitis as a potential diagnosis, even in the absence of typical risk factors.\n10. Costochondritis: Inflammation of the costal cartilage can cause localized chest pain that is palpable, which aligns with the tenderness and absence of other more severe findings in this patient."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Virginia M. Pierce: A 13-month-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of pneumonia. Nine days before admission, fever and vomiting developed in the child. The vomiting resolved after 2 days, but fever with a maximum temperature of 39.7C continued, and the child was fussier than usual. On the fourth day of illness, cough developed. Her parents administered acetaminophen and ibuprofen, but her condition did not improve. On the seventh day of illness, her parents brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the parents reported that the childs appetite had decreased but she had been drinking well and had a normal volume of urine output. On examination, the child was fussy but consolable and appeared mildly ill. The temperature was 37.0C, the pulse 145 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 9.1 kg 46th percentile. Multiple discrete, mobile, mildly enlarged, superficial cervical lymph nodes were present bilaterally; the remainder of the examination was normal. Testing for influenza virus was negative. Urinalysis revealed yellow, slightly cloudy urine, with a specific gravity of 1.017, a pH of 6.0, and 1 ketones. Blood and urine samples were sent for culture; results of other laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Dr. Randheer Shailam: Chest radiography revealed dense consolidation of the left upper lobe and, to a lesser extent, the left lower lobe. There was no pleural effusion Fig. 1A. Dr. Pierce: One dose of ceftriaxone was administered intravenously, and cefdinir was prescribed. The family was advised to follow up with the primary pediatrician 2 days later. During the next 2 days, fevers persisted despite administration of cefdinir, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen. The cough increased, tachypnea developed, and the use of accessory muscles in the neck and chest was noted. Oral intake and urine output decreased. The child was brought back to the emergency department for evaluation. The history was obtained from the childs mother. The child had been born after a full-term gestation. The results of newborn blood-spot screening tests i.e., a panel of tests for multiple congenital diseases, primarily inborn errors of metabolism had been normal. The child had been well until 4 months before admission, when a diagnosis of pneumonia was made; she was treated as an outpatient with a 10-day course of an unspecified oral antibiotic agent. Six weeks before admission, she was seen in the emergency department because of vomiting and diarrhea; a diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis was made. Four weeks before admission, she returned to the emergency department because of fever and was again thought to have a viral illness. Three weeks before admission, she received a diagnosis of acute otitis media and was treated with an unspecified oral antibiotic. During the 4 months before admission, the child reportedly did not gain any weight. Medications included acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and cefdinir. She had no known allergies, and immunizations were reportedly current. She was of Brazilian ancestry, was born in New England, and had not traveled. She lived in an urban area of New England with her parents and 5-year-old sister; her mother was a homemaker and her father was a carpenter. The family kept canaries in the home as pets; they had previously had pet cats but not during the 2 months before admission. The child’s maternal grandmother had asthma. In the child’s mother, an ipsilateral axillary mass had developed after she had received the bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine during infancy in Brazil; the mass had been resected, and antibiotics had been administered for many months. While the mother was pregnant with the child, a tuberculin skin test was positive and a chest radiograph was normal. On examination, the child was in mild respiratory distress. The temperature was 37.8°C, the pulse 193 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 60 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air. The lips were dry. Nasal flaring and suprasternal, intercostal, and subcostal retractions were present. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Tests for respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and metapneumovirus were negative. A blood sample was sent for culture; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Findings on a chest radiograph appeared unchanged from 2 days earlier. Intravenous fluids, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and acetaminophen were administered. The child was admitted to the hospital. During the next 2 days, the administration of intravenous fluids, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin was continued. Fever and cough persisted, and emesis occurred intermittently. On the third hospital day, vancomycin therapy was added. Laboratory tests results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Shailam: Ultrasonography of the chest was performed, and incidental findings in the spleen prompted extension of the study to include the abdomen and pelvis. The spleen was enlarged and contained numerous hypoechoic lesions measuring up to 1 cm in diameter (Figure 1B). There were multiple enlarged peripancreatic, periportal, and perisplenic lymph nodes, some of which were centrally hypoechoic. Dr. Pierce: A tuberculin skin test was placed, and airborne precautions were instituted. Dr. Shailam: The next day, computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. The findings included left supraclavicular, left hilar, mediastinal, upper abdominal, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy, as well as splenomegaly with multiple hypodense splenic lesions, consolidation with air bronchograms involving the majority of the left upper lobe, scattered pulmonary nodules (measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter), and narrowing of the left main-stem bronchus due to bulky lymphadenopathy (Figure 1C through 1F). Dr. Pierce: Azithromycin therapy was discontinued. On the fifth hospital day, bronchoscopy revealed marked external compression of the left main-stem bronchus and left upper lobe and scant secretions in the airways. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed; acid-fast staining of the BAL fluid revealed rare acid-fast bacilli, and a nucleic-acid amplification test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Induration (8 mm in diameter) was noted at the site of the tuberculin skin test. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Diagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made. Three months later, the child’s 33-year-old mother was admitted to this hospital because of pain in the right hip. The mother had been well until 6 weeks before admission, when pain in the right groin developed. The pain was initially intermittent and then became more constant, with radiation to the right buttock. She was seen in an urgent care clinic; radiographs of the hip that were obtained during that visit were reportedly normal. A limp developed, and during the 3 weeks before admission, the pain progressed in severity and she began to hold onto objects to support herself as she walked. During this time, she returned to the urgent care clinic and was also seen by her primary care physician. She took ibuprofen, diclofenac, prednisone, and another unspecified medication, but her symptoms did not improve. On the day of admission, the mother presented to the emergency department of this hospital because of progressive pain and difficulty walking. In the emergency department, the mother reported that no trauma had preceded the onset of pain. She had lost 4.5 kg in weight during the previous 2 months while dieting. She had no fevers, chills, or night sweats. On examination, the vital signs were normal. The gait was antalgic. There was tenderness on palpation of the right hip, and a log-roll test was positive; the active and passive ranges of motion of the right hip were limited by pain. The remainder of the examination was normal. A urinalysis was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Shailam: Radiography of the pelvis revealed an ill-defined lytic region in the superior aspect of the right femoral neck (Figure 2A). Magnetic resonance imaging of the right hip, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a large lesion at the junction of the right femoral head and neck that had extended through the femoral neck and had caused cortical destruction. There were destructive changes at the femoroacetabular joint, as well as a small joint effusion, exuberant intramuscular edema throughout the upper thigh, markedly enlarged right external and common iliac lymph nodes, and foci of abnormal marrow signal in both iliac wings (Figure 2B through 2F). Dr. Pierce: Viscous, serosanguineous fluid was aspirated from the right hip joint. Analysis of the synovial fluid revealed a nucleated-cell count of 34 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 200). Gram’s staining, acid-fast staining, and calcofluor white staining of a wet-mount preparation revealed no organisms. The mother was admitted to the hospital. Additional diagnostic studies were performed, and a diagnosis was made. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Autosomal dominant heterozygous IFNγR1 defi-ciency. Disseminated Mycobacterium genavense infection. ", "prediction": "1. Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection: This is the leading diagnosis given the child's exposure history, the presence of rare acid-fast bacilli on BAL fluid, and significant lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly with hypodense lesions noted on imaging.\n2. Bacterial pneumonia: Continued fever, cough, and the left upper lobe consolidation on the chest X-ray strongly support the diagnosis of a bacterial lung infection, particularly given the lack of response to initial antibiotics.\n3. Viral pneumonia: Despite the negative tests for common respiratory viruses, the presentation of cough, fever, and respiratory distress could still suggest a viral etiology not identified by standard testing.\n4. Aspiration pneumonia: The history of intermittent vomiting and subsequent development of pulmonary consolidation suggests possible aspiration leading to lung infection.\n5. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia: Given the prolonged course, extensive pulmonary involvement, and lymphadenopathy, an opportunistic infection, such as PCP, must be considered, especially if the child is immunocompromised.\n6. Viral-induced lymphadenopathy: The extensive lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly could be due to a viral infection like Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus, despite initial negative viral tests.\n7. Lymphoma: The significant lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and persistent systemic symptoms raise the possibility of an underlying malignancy such as lymphoma.\n8. Sarcoidosis: Multisystem involvement with lymphadenopathy and granulomatous inflammation seen in the spleen, lungs, and lymph nodes can suggest sarcoidosis.\n9. Brucellosis: The child’s Brazilian ancestry and exposure to animals, coupled with systemic symptoms and splenomegaly with hypoechoic lesions, necessitate considering brucellosis.\n10. Histoplasmosis: The clinical presentation with fever, cough, and multifocal lymphadenopathy alongside splenic lesions may point toward histoplasmosis, especially considering possible exposure to bird droppings."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Alexandra J. Coromilas Medicine: A 65-year-old woman with autoimmune hepatitis and acute liver failure was transferred to this hospital for an evaluation for liver transplantation. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 6 years before this admission, when she received abnormal results of liver-function tests at another hospital. She underwent a follow-up evaluation that revealed an elevated antinuclear antibody titer. Levels of ceruloplasmin, 1-antitrypsin, and antimitochondrial antibodies were normal, and tests for tissue transglutaminase antibodies and viral hepatitis were negative. A presumptive diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis with cirrhosis was made, and treatment with glucocorticoids was recommended. However, results of liver-function tests reportedly normalized without treatment during the following year. Approximately 7 weeks before this admission, malaise, fatigue, and jaundice developed in the patient, and she was evaluated at the other hospital. The alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were elevated at 1844 IU per liter reference range, 0 to 40 and 1451 IU per liter reference range, 0 to 37, respectively. She had a bilirubin level of 7.9 mg per deciliter 135.1 mol per liter; reference range, 0 to 1.0 mg per deciliter 0 to 17.1 mol per liter, an antinuclear antibody titer of 1:640 reference range, 1:160, detectable antismooth muscle antibodies, and an IgG level of 2584 mg per deciliter reference range, 700 to 1600. Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant revealed a nodular liver. Prednisone therapy was begun. The patients condition improved, and plans were made to transition treatment from prednisone to azathioprine. However, the patient elected to taper the course of prednisone within 4 weeks and started to take natural supplements instead of the prescribed azathioprine. Two weeks later, approximately 7 days before this admission, the patients daughter noted that her mother had jaundice. Four days before this admission, the patient was found on the floor of her home and was delirious; she was admitted to the other hospital. She had a temperature of 39.5C, an albumin level of 2.4 mg per deciliter reference range, 3.2 to 5.2, a total bilirubin level of 15.4 mg per deciliter 263.3 mol per liter, an alanine aminotransferase level of 1040 IU per liter, an aspartate aminotransferase level of 738 IU per liter, an ammonia level of 66 mol per liter reference range, 11 to 51, an international normalized ratio INR of 5.2 reference range, 0.9 to 1.2, a creatinine level of 0.57 mg per deciliter 50 mol per liter; reference range, 0.5 to 1.3 mg per deciliter 44 to 115 mol per liter, a lactate level of 9.9 mmol per liter 89 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter 5 to 20 mg per deciliter, and a platelet count of 111,000 per cubic millimeter reference range, 140,000 to 440,000. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed an ill-defined echogenicity of the right lobe of the liver that had not been present 3 months earlier; there was no hydronephrosis. Oral methylprednisone, intravenous vitamin K, lactulose, and rifaximin were administered. Oliguric acute kidney injury developed, with a creatinine level as high as 3.6 mg per deciliter 318 mol per liter. Results of an evaluation of the urine sediment were unremarkable. An albumin infusion was administered, but the patient had no improvement in creatinine level or urine output. The patients kidney injury was considered to be consistent with the hepatorenal syndrome. Midodrine and octreotide were administered. Fever and leukocytosis with a white-cell count as high as 27,000 per cubic millimeter reference range, 4200 to 10,200 developed, and a blood sample was obtained for culture. After approximately 56 hours of incubation, microbial growth was detected in the aerobic blood-culture bottle, and a Grams stain of the blood-culture broth showed a corkscrew-shaped gram-negative rod Fig. 1. Empirical vancomycin and ceftriaxone were administered; ceftriaxone therapy was discontinued after one dose, and piperacillintazo-bactam therapy was initiated. The patient was then transferred to the medical service of this hospital. On admission to this hospital, the patient reported that she had had nonbloody diarrhea during the days before the evaluation at the other hospital, without nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. She also reported that she had coughed up blood-tinged sputum once during the weeks before admission, but she had had no hemateme-sis, melena, or other bleeding. The patient had a history of heavy alcohol consumption and had undergone a tubal ligation. She had taken no prescribed medications before admission to the other hospital, but she had been taking supplements, including milk thistle and buckthorn. She did not report the use of any nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. The use of codeine caused nausea and vomiting. The patient was from a city in a neighboring state and lived alone. She worked in the health care field and had an adult daughter who was healthy. For several years, she had consumed 3 to 5 half gallons of distilled spirits per week, but she stopped drinking alcohol after she received a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis 6 years earlier. She had a remote history of smoking and did not report the use of any illicit drugs. She had an indoor cat but no other exposure to animals, and had not traveled recently. There was no family history of liver disease. On examination, the temperature was 37.1C, the heart rate 65 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126/60 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94 while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared fatigued but was oriented to person, place, and time, and she could recite the days of the week backward. The sclerae were icteric and the skin was jaundiced, with scattered spider angiomata and faint ecchymoses. Auscultation of the lungs revealed bibasilar crackles. The abdomen was soft, nontender, and slightly distended, with a possible fluid wave. The liver and spleen were not palpable. Clinically significant edema was present from the lower legs to the sacrum. A limited neurologic examination revealed no asterixis. A urinalysis was unremarkable. Tests for hepatitis A virus IgM antibodies, hepatitis B virus surface antibodies, hepatitis B virus core antibodies, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, and hepatitis C virus antibodies were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Efren J. Flores: A chest radiograph showed multifocal air-space opacities and bilateral pleural effusions Fig. 2A. Computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, confirmed the presence of diffuse ground-glass opacities predominantly in the upper lobes, central interlobular septal thickening, and a nodular hepatic contour Fig. 2B and 2C. There were multiple prominent portal and perihepatic lymph nodes and small-volume ascites. Dr. Coromilas: Piperacillintazobactam, doxycy-cline, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole were administered, and treatment with lactulose, rifaximin, albumin, midodrine, and octreotide was continued.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Rachelle E. Gupta Pediatrics: A 19-month-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of failure to thrive. The patient had been born in Puerto Rico by induced vaginal delivery after 41 weeks of gestation. Her mother did not smoke, drink alcohol, or take any medications during the pregnancy. Results of prenatal laboratory testing had reportedly suggested maternal hyperthyroidism, but follow-up studies revealed normal thyroid function. The delivery was uncomplicated, and the birth weight was 3.2 kg 50th percentile. The patients growth had been assessed as normal until she was 9 months of age, when she attended a clinic visit. The weight was 7.0 kg 10th percentile, which was lower than the weight at the most recent clinic visit, 2 months earlier 7.1 kg 27th percentile Fig. 1. Follow-up appointments were scheduled. The patient returned to the clinic when she was 12 months of age, and the weight was 7.3 kg 6th percentile. The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, red-cell count, and red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, total carnitine, free carnitine, and ammonia; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.025, a pH of 6.0, 2 leukocyte esterase, and trace blood by dipstick; on microscopic examination, squamous epithelial cells and bacteria were present and there were 2 to 5 white cells and 0 to 2 red cells per high-power field. A urine culture grew very few mixed bacteria. Nutritional shakes were prescribed through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. When the patient attended a clinic visit 6 weeks later, the weight was 7.7 kg 7th percentile. The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, red-cell count, and red-cell indexes were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was referred for evaluation by a geneticist, who reportedly did not suspect a genetic cause of poor weight gain. When the patient was 14.5 months of age, she was seen by a nutritionist; a detailed meal plan that was designed to provide a balanced, high-kilocalorie diet was recommended. The results of a sweat chloride test were reportedly normal. One month later, the patient was evaluated by an endocrinologist. Blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density li-poprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, total carni-tine, free carnitine, follicle-stimulating hormone, and estradiol were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A radiographic assessment of bone age in the left hand according to the method of Greulich and Pyle revealed a bone age of 1 year 6 months, which was within 1 SD of normal. Methimazole was prescribed; the patients mother administered the drug for 3 days before stopping because of unspecified side effects. Two weeks later, the patient was seen by a second endocrinologist. The patients mother reported that the child was an active toddler and that she had a strong appetite and ate a wide variety of foods throughout the day; however, she had not gained weight despite following the meal plan recommended by the nutritionist. On examination, the patient was thin, with wasting of the buttocks. There was no hepatospleno-megaly, and the external female genitalia were classified as Tanner stage 1 with stages ranging from 1 to 5 and higher stages indicating more advanced pubertal development. A glucometer and test strips were provided to the mother, with instructions to record the fasting and 2-hour postprandial blood glucose levels. Ten days after this clinic visit, tests for thyrotropin-receptor antibodies and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins were negative. The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, red-cell count, and red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and glycated hemoglobin; other test results are shown in Table 1. Results of ultra-sonography of the thyroid gland, which was performed 3 days later, were normal. At a follow-up visit in the endocrinology clinic when the patient was 17 months of age, the weight was 7.6 kg 2nd percentile. Tests for antithyroglobulin antibodies, antitissue trans-glutaminase IgA and IgG antibodies, and anti-gliadin IgA and IgG antibodies were negative, and blood levels of phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, thyroid peroxidase, and 25-hydroxy-vitamin D were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The endocrinologist recommended that the patient be evaluated in a multidisciplinary, coordinated pediatric-care system in the continental United States, and the patient and her mother relocated to New England the following month. When the patient was 19 months of age, she was seen in a pediatric clinic and directly admitted to the inpatient pediatric unit of a community hospital affiliated with this hospital for evaluation of failure to thrive. On admission, the patients mother reported that the child ate large amounts of food equal to the amounts eaten by her 5-year-old brother and never seemed satisfied. The patient had no abdominal pain or diarrhea. When she was between 10 and 12 months of age, she had begun to vomit intermittently. Nonbloody, nonbilious emesis occurred approximately once per week thereafter; the mother attributed the vomiting to overeating. The patient had briefly been hospitalized during infancy for influenza and at 16 months of age for bronchiolitis. She had crawled at 7 months of age, cruised at 10 months of age, and walked at 12 months of age. She walked up steps with assistance, ran, spoke eight words, pointed to indicate wants, and scribbled spontaneously. The mother described the child as happy and playful and reported that she behaved as though she were healthy. The timing of dental eruption had been normal. The patient received no medications, had no known allergies, and had received routine childhood vaccinations. Since she had moved from Puerto Rico 1 month earlier, she had been living with her mother, 5-year-old brother, and step-grandmother in an urban area of New England. The patients mother was healthy, her brother had attention deficithyperactivity disorder, and her fathers medical history was unknown. On examination, the patient had cachexia; she otherwise appeared well and happy, was playful and active, and walked rapidly around the hospital room. The temperature was 37.2C, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the blood pressure 125/55 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 7.4 kg 1st percentile. The anterior fonta-nelle was closed, and the remainder of the physical examination was normal. The next day, the patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation. The vital signs were normal, and the weight was 7.3 kg 1st percentile; the results of the physical examination were otherwise unchanged. Tests for antitissue transglutaminase IgA and IgG antibodies and human immunodeficiency virus infection were negative. The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, red-cell count, red-cell indexes, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal, as were blood levels of phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and C-reactive protein; other test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "The diencephalic syndrome. ", "prediction": "1. Hyperthyroidism: Despite normal follow-up thyroid studies, the mother's early reports of hyperthyroidism and the child's persistent failure to thrive warrant reconsideration of thyroid dysfunction.\n2. Malabsorption syndrome: Given the failure to thrive despite high-calorie intake, conditions like celiac disease, even with negative antibodies, or other malabsorption syndromes should be considered.\n3. Cystic fibrosis (CF): Despite a normal sweat chloride test, atypical CF presentations can sometimes have negative initial tests and should be reconsidered due to persistent failure to thrive and history of bronchiolitis.\n4. Growth hormone deficiency: The child's growth can be influenced by inadequate growth hormone levels, which would need specific testing to confirm.\n5. Inborn errors of metabolism: Normal carnitine levels don't rule out all metabolic disorders, and rare conditions may need more specialized testing.\n6. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): The history of intermittent vomiting could suggest GERD, contributing to poor weight gain.\n7. Chronic infection: Persistent, low-grade infections like urinary tract infections (UTI) or tuberculosis, which can sometimes present inconspicuously, could impede growth.\n8. Psychosocial deprivation: Non-organic causes such as insufficient nurturing and stimulation could lead to failure to thrive in an otherwise healthy child.\n9. Mitochondrial disorder: Despite no immediate signs, mitochondrial dysfunctions could present with subtle, intermittent symptoms affecting growth and energy utilization.\n10. Celiac disease with seronegative presentation: Although celiac serologies are negative, a biopsy or genetic testing might still reveal celiac disease in the context of continued failure to thrive."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Amulya Nagarur: A 64-year-old man was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of dyspnea, wheezing, headaches, cough, and night sweats. Approximately 6 years before this presentation, the patient had received a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, which had been made by a rheumatologist at another hospital. Two years before this presentation, the patient had had a sudden onset of pain on the right side of the lower back and buttock, with hypoesthesia and weakness in the right leg. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI revealed lumbosacral disk protrusion at L5S1, with moderate-to-severe foraminal encroachment on the right side. Needle electromyography revealed evidence of L5 radiculopathy on the right side. Neurosurgery consultants recommended physical therapy, and two gluco-corticoid injections were administered, which improved symptoms. However, 2 months later, electromyography revealed persistent active L5 radiculopathy on the right side that had not improved since the previous study had been obtained. Approximately 1.5 years before this presentation, the patients rheumatologist reported that the patient had a persistent right foot drop and persistent tenderness of the paraspinal muscles. In addition, a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome was made on the basis of the gradual onset of bilateral hand and wrist discomfort and hand paresthesias. Approximately 5 months before this presentation, the patient noted the onset of a cough that produced thin yellow sputum. During the next month, exertional dyspnea, chest tightness, and wheezing developed. Six weeks later 9 weeks before this presentation, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician at another hospital. On examination, rhonchi and wheezing were noted; the remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was reportedly normal. A diagnosis of bronchitis was made, and an albuterol inhaler and azithromycin were prescribed. The patient was referred to an allergist, because there were concerns about allergic bronchitis. On evaluation by the allergist, epicutaneous and intradermal skin tests revealed no reaction to pollens, molds including aspergillus, or dust mites. Pulmonary-function testing revealed a forced expiratory volume in 1 second FEV1 of 2.51 liters 77 of the predicted value, a forced vital capacity FVC of 3.03 liters 70 of the predicted value, and a ratio of FEV1 to FVC of 83; these results were interpreted to be indica-tive of a restrictive ventilatory defect. There was no improvement after the administration of a bronchodilator; a methacholine challenge was not performed. The fraction of exhaled nitric oxide Feno was 112 ppb reference range, 25. Budesonideformoterol was prescribed. Two weeks later, the wheezing and cough had resolved. Repeat pulmonary-function testing revealed improvements, including an FEV1 of 3.05 liters 94 of the predicted value, an FVC of 3.55 liters 82 of the predicted value, and a ratio of FEV1 to FVC of 86. The Feno had decreased to 59 ppb. Ten days before this presentation, lethargy, myalgias, chills, headaches, anorexia, and night sweats developed. Nine days later, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician because of recurrent cough, night sweats, myalgia, and fatigue. The temperature was 37.8C, the heart rate 105 beats per minute, the blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The breath sounds were described as harsh. A urinalysis was notable for the presence of microscopic hematuria; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Doxycycline was prescribed empirically for possible Lyme disease. The next day, the patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. He reported bitemporal headaches, and he described the pain as bandlike; the headaches had occurred intermittently at first and then constantly during the previous 3 days. He also reported associated neck stiffness and photophobia. He had a fever, aching of the jaw muscles with chewing, and diffuse aches, including joint pain of the hands, fingers, spine, hips, and knees. Nausea with one episode of emesis had occurred after he had taken a dose of doxy-cycline on an empty stomach; he took a total of three doses and then discontinued the medication when the serologic test for Lyme disease was reported as negative. He had no weight loss, vision changes, or other cardiac, pulmonary, joint, ocular, or neurologic symptoms. The patient had undergone surgery for knee osteoarthritis, had received physical therapy and glucocorticoid injections for rotator-cuff tendi-nopathies, and had had an appendectomy at 19 years of age. He had neck osteoarthritis, cervical spondylosis, sleep apnea, and peptic ulcer disease. He had had a negative tuberculin skin test in the past. Medications included a budesonide formoterol inhaler. Allergies reportedly included aspirin, which was noted to cause tightness in the throat. The patient lived with his wife and worked in a health care facility, where he was exposed to patients and multiple sick contacts. He drank alcohol on social occasions; he had smoked two packs of cigarettes per week during college and smoked cigars intermittently thereafter. He had traveled to Florida 1 month before this evaluation and to Europe and the Caribbean during the previous 8 months; he had had no animal or insect exposures. His father had died at 54 years of age from complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus; his mother had had hypothyroidism and had died at 83 years of age from acute leukemia. A sister had systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and Hashimotos thyroiditis. On examination, the temperature was 38.7C, the heart rate 118 beats per minute, the blood pressure 133/74 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96 while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared mildly ill. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. There was no tenderness on the scalp or head. The neck was described as stiff. Inspiratory crackles were present in both lungs. There was mild synovial thickening in the hands, a finding consistent with chronic arthritic changes. There was no asymmetry on neurologic strength testing. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of coagulation tests were normal, and the IgE level was less than 5 IU per milliliter reference range, 0 to 100. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Florian J. Fintelmann: Portable chest radiography showed clear, well-inflated lungs. Computed tomography CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, showed signs of chronic sinusitis, including opacification and wall thickening in the frontal, ethmoid, and maxillary sinuses. Dr. Nagarur: Because of the persistent headache and neck stiffness, a lumbar puncture was performed and cerebrospinal fluid CSF was obtained. Analysis of the CSF revealed a nucleated-cell count of 1 per cubic millimeter and a protein level of 30 mg per deciliter reference range, 5 to 55. The glucose level was not checked, and the opening pressure was not recorded. A Grams stain of the CSF showed no polymorphonuclear cells or organisms. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. ", "prediction": "1. Chronic Sinusitis: Chronic sinusitis is suggested by the CT scan findings of opacification and wall thickening in the sinuses, which can cause headaches and other facial pain.\n2. Fibromyalgia: The patient's history of widespread pain, tenderness, and fatigue is consistent with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, previously confirmed by a rheumatologist.\n3. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: Bilateral hand and wrist discomfort with paresthesias aligns with the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome made by the rheumatologist.\n4. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient's history of smoking and respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, wheezing, and cough, which responded to bronchodilators and steroids, suggests COPD.\n5. Lyme Disease: Although serologic tests were negative, symptoms like fatigue, myalgias, night sweats, and headaches could be consistent with Lyme disease exposure, meriting consideration given the patient's travel history.\n6. Meningitis: The combination of headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, and fever raises concern for meningitis, though CSF analysis does not strongly support this.\n7. Giant Cell Arteritis: Given the temporal headache and jaw claudication with chewing in the context of systemic symptoms, giant cell arteritis is a potential diagnosis, especially in an older adult.\n8. Rheumatoid Arthritis: The mild synovial thickening in the hands suggests chronic arthritis, which might indicate rheumatoid arthritis considering the family history of autoimmune diseases.\n9. Polymyalgia Rheumatica: The patient's age, systemic symptoms (myalgia, stiffness), and history of autoimmune disease in the family are consistent with polymyalgia rheumatica.\n10. Tuberculosis: Despite a negative past tuberculin test, the patient's travel history, night sweats, and lung symptoms bring tuberculosis into consideration, especially in the context of healthcare exposure."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Daniel B. Rubin Neurology: A 57-year-old-woman was admitted to this hospital because of progressive hypoesthesia, paresthesia, and weakness in the arms and legs. The patient had been in her usual health until 18 months before this admission, when paresthesia developed in the feet. Sixteen months before this admission, the patient underwent lumbar surgery, including laminectomy and facetectomies at L3L4 and bilateral foraminotomies at L4. After surgery, she reported that the symptoms in the feet had diminished. Nine months before this admission, hypoesthesia and weakness recurred in the feet; over a period of several months, they spread to involve the legs and hands. The patient had several falls at home and began to use a cane and then a wheelchair. Eight months before this admission, she was evaluated at an outpatient neurology clinic, and electromyography and nerve-conduction studies were performed. A presumptive diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneu-ropathy CIDP was made, and intravenous immune globulin IVIG was administered; the patient reported transient improvement in sensation and strength in her legs and hands. During the next 6 months, IVIG was administered every 4 weeks, but hypoesthesia and weakness progressed to involve both arms. When she was no longer able to transfer safely into a wheelchair, she presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department of the other hospital, the patient reported inconsistent bowel and bladder continence and progressive hypoesthesia and weakness in her legs and arms. She had a history of chronic low-back pain which had been treated with opioids, fibromyalgia, headaches, and depression. Surgeries included appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and hysterectomy in the distant past, as well as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass approximately 4 years earlier. Medications included controlled-release morphine sulfate, hydrocodone with acetaminophen, gabapentin, diazepam, cyclobenzaprine, valproic acid, citalo-pram, cyanocobalamin, and cholecalciferol. The patient was married, lived with her husband in New England, and did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There was no family history of autoimmune disease; her father had a history of bladder cancer. On examination at the other hospital, the temperature was 36.6C, the blood pressure 138/66 mm Hg, the pulse 64 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The oropharynx had no erythema or exudate; the patient was edentulous, with a normal-appearing oral mucosa and tongue. Results of cranial-nerve examinations were normal although the first cranial nerve was not tested. Strength was 01 out of 5 in the legs and 3 out of 5 in the arms. Sensation to pinprick was decreased in both legs, from the toes to the hips. Negative inspiratory force at functional residual capacity and vital capacity were normal. A stage 2 pressure ulcer was present over the sacrum. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, vitamin B12 cobalamin, and vitamin B9 folate were normal, as were results of kidney- and liver-function tests. Blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus HIV type 1 p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 and hepatitis C virus were negative. The blood level of valproic acid was 15.3 g per milliliter therapeutic range, 50 to 100. Urinalysis was unremarkable. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head was performed without the administration of contrast material; T2-weighted images showed mild abnormalities in the periventricular white matter, a finding consistent with a chronic small-vessel ischemic process. Valproic acid was stopped, high-dose methylprednisolone was administered, and the patient was transferred to the neurology department of this hospital for evaluation. On examination at this hospital, results of a mental-status examination including tests of language, attention, and memory were normal. There was no voluntary movement in the legs; there was atrophy of the calf and foot muscles. Weakness was more severe in the hands than in the proximal arms. Deep-tendon reflexes were 2 at the ankles, 3 at the patellas, and 3 at the biceps. Perception of vibration, light touch, and pinprick was absent in the legs and diminished in the arms. Sensation to pinprick was impaired caudal to the T4 level. The plantar reflex was absent bilaterally. A blood test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:40, with a speckled pattern. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed a normal pattern, with a moderate, diffuse increase in immune globulin. Screening tests for antitreponemal antibodies and for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi and human T-lymphotropic virus HTLV types 1 and 2 were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Nerve-conduction studies and needle electromyography were performed. Dr. William S. David: The nerve-conduction studies revealed normal sensory responses, apart from a mildly reduced amplitude of the right ulnar nerve. Fibular motor responses could not be elicited in the extensor digitorum brevis muscle in either leg; fibular motor responses were severely reduced in the tibialis anterior muscle in both legs, as were posterior tibial motor responses in the abductor hallucis muscle. Distal motor latencies and velocities were normal. Needle electromyography revealed scattered fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves in two muscles in the right arm and two muscles in the right leg. The patient was unable to activate units in several muscles in the arms and legs. In other muscles, there was a reduced number of normal-appearing motor units and slow firing of those units, findings suggestive of impaired activation. Dr. Rubin: MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed mild scattered degenerative changes of the spine, with no evidence of cord compression, nerve-root impingement, or a demyelinating process. A lumbar puncture was performed for analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid CSF; results are shown in Table 1. Hypoesthesia and weakness in the arms and legs did not improve, and the results of a neurologic examination were unchanged from those obtained on admission. Dr. David: On the fifth hospital day, studies for somatosensory evoked potentials were performed. The right median somatosensory evoked potential was normal; the left side was not studied. The P37 scalp waveform was absent in the right tibial somatosensory evoked potential, a finding that suggested a disruption of central conduction. Dr. Rubin: A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Copper deficiency myelopathy. ", "prediction": "1. Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP): The patient's history of progressive hypoesthesia, paresthesia, and weakness, along with transient improvement with IVIG, supports CIDP as a likely diagnosis.\n2. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS): The combination of progressive muscle weakness, atrophy, and reduced voluntary muscle activation suggests a possible motor neuron disease like ALS.\n3. Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN): The asymmetric weakness, especially more severe in the hands than in the proximal arms, could indicate MMN.\n4. Small Fiber Neuropathy: The presence of paresthesia and hypoesthesia spreading from the feet to hands points to potential involvement of small nerve fibers.\n5. Multiple Sclerosis (MS): The history of variable sensory deficits and small-vessel ischemic changes on MRI raises the possibility of MS.\n6. Peripheral Neuropathy secondary to Vitamin Deficiency: While B12 and folate levels were normal, previous gastric bypass surgery raises the risk of other potential vitamin deficiencies contributing to neuropathy.\n7. Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS): Though less likely given the chronicity, the progressive nature of weakening and hypoesthesia involving legs and arms can also be seen in GBS variants.\n8. Paraneoplastic Neuropathy: Despite a lack of clear initial evidence of malignancy, paraneoplastic syndromes can present with similar neurological symptoms.\n9. Spinal Cord Lesion: While imaging did not show cord compression, a non-compressive myelopathy such as transverse myelitis could explain the extensive sensory and motor deficits.\n10. Systemic Vasculitis: The positive antinuclear antibodies and small-vessel ischemic changes on MRI might indicate systemic vasculitis affecting the peripheral nerves."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Amy E. Yuan Medicine: A 30-year-old man was admitted to this hospital during the summer because of fatigue, rash, fevers, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Three years before this admission, the patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident that resulted in a large hematoma across the chest and umbilicus. He was evaluated at another hospital. Computed tomography CT of the head, cervical spine, abdomen, and pelvis, performed with the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed stranding of the anterior abdominal wall, the subcutaneous tissues of the left flank, and the fat of the left retroperitoneum Fig. 1; this finding was reported to be consistent with soft-tissue contusion or hemorrhage. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was discharged home. Two days later, gross hematuria developed, and the patient was evaluated at the other hospital; laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. He was transferred to this hospital for evaluation of thrombocytopenia and hematuria. Dr. Amirkasra Mojtahed: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed with and without the intravenous administration of contrast material in accordance with a he-maturia protocol, revealed no renal or ureteral stones, solid renal masses, or ureteral or bladder filling defects. The stranding of the anterior abdominal wall, left flank, and left retroperitoneum appeared to have been stable since the previous study had been obtained, 3 days earlier. Dr. Yuan: The hematuria resolved without intervention. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed anisocytosis and polychromasia of the red cells, with occasional schistocytes, as well as a reduced number of platelets and normal-appearing white cells. Giemsa staining of thick and thin blood smears revealed no intracellular organisms. Tests for IgG and IgM antibodies to Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Borrelia burgdorferi were negative. The thrombocyto-penia and anemia were attributed to large soft-tissue hematomas and hematuria, and the patient was discharged home. On followup evaluation 1 week after discharge, the platelet count was 242,000 per cubic millimeter normal range, 150,000 to 400,000; 1 month after discharge, the hematocrit was 44 normal range, 41 to 53. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 weeks before the current admission to this hospital, when fatigue, generalized weakness, and dyspnea on exertion developed. Four episodes of palpitations, chest tightness, and diaphoresis occurred during the 2-week period leading up to admission; they lasted less than 1 minute each, and the patient attributed them to panic attacks. Five days before this admission, fevers and night sweats developed, and the highest measured temperature was 38.3C. Three days before this admission, the patient noted an area of erythema in the posterior aspect of the right knee and bruising on both arms. One day before this admission, an episode of weakness and tunnel vision occurred while the patient was standing; he lowered himself to the ground but did not lose consciousness. Severe fatigue persisted after the episode, and he was evaluated in the emergency department of the other hospital. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Giemsa staining of thick and thin blood smears revealed no intracellular organisms. A screening test for antibodies to B. burgdorferi was positive. Doxycycline, clindamycin, and quinine were administered, and the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported a mild headache, which diminished after the administration of ibuprofen; there was no neck pain or photophobia. He had a history of alcohol-use disorder, peptic ulcer disease, Barretts esophagus, and anxiety. He had no history of easy bruising or bleeding, despite previous trauma, including a fall from a roof 3 years before admission. Recent medications included diazepam and citalopram. He drank alcohol occasionally in a binge pattern but had not had any during the past 2 weeks. He did not smoke cigarettes, use illicit drugs, or take herbal medications. He resided on an island in New England and worked as a restaurant cook. He noted ticks on his body several times per month and had removed a tick 2 weeks before this presentation. His mother had diabetes, and his fa-ther had hypertension. There was no family history of hematologic cancer. On examination, the temperature was 36.6C, the blood pressure 112/57 mm Hg, the pulse 88 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was alert and oriented and did not appear ill. The first and second heart sounds were normal, and the lungs were clear. The abdomen was not distended; bowel sounds were present, with no tenderness on palpation or hepatosplenomegaly. There was no swelling in the legs. An area of blanching erythema (6 cm in diameter) was present on the right popliteal fossa (Figure 2A); a similar lesion (5 cm in diameter) was present near the left patella. Areas of petechiae were noted in the erythematous lesions and on the left flank. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear (Figure 2B) revealed mostly normocytic erythrocytes, with less than 1 schistocyte per high-power field (i.e., occasional schistocytes were seen, but not in every high-power field), increased reticulocytes, no spherocytes, minor basophilic stippling, and no inclusion bodies in erythrocytes. Platelets were decreased in number but increased in size and had normal granularity. White cells appeared normal and had a normal granulation pattern. Giemsa staining of thick and thin blood smears revealed no intracellular organisms. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) p24 antigen and HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies were negative. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood and 2+ protein, with no glucose, ketones, bilirubin, urobilinogen, or nitrates; the specific gravity and pH were normal, and examination of the sediment revealed 20 to 50 red cells per high-power field (normal range, 0 to 2). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Two units of packed red cells were transfused; the hematocrit increased from 17.6% on admission to 22.5% (normal range, 41 to 53), and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Azithromycin and atovaquone were administered, and doxycycline was continued. On the third hospital day, the patient had the sudden onset of expressive aphasia, pronator drift of the right arm, and inability to follow complex commands. The remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Mojtahed: CT angiography of the head and neck revealed normal intracranial and neck vessels. There was no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, acute infarction, or intracranial lesions. Dr. Yuan: A diagnostic test was performed, and management decisions were made. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Combined inherited and acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. ", "prediction": "1. Ehrlichiosis: Given the patient's history of multiple tick exposures and symptoms including rash, fever, and thrombocytopenia, Ehrlichiosis remains a prime consideration despite negative serological tests.\n2. Babesiosis: The patient's geographical location (New England), a history of tick bites, and symptoms including fever, hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia, suggest possible Babesia infection.\n3. Lyme disease: A positive screening test for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi combined with the presence of erythema migrans and systemic symptoms make Lyme disease highly likely.\n4. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH): Persistent fevers, pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and high ferritin levels raise suspicion for HLH, a severe systemic inflammatory syndrome.\n5. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): The combination of hematologic abnormalities, fatigue, rash, and systemic symptoms could indicate SLE, especially with no clear infectious cause.\n6. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): The patient's thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, neurological changes, and fever are consistent with TTP, a life-threatening condition requiring immediate intervention.\n7. Anaplasmosis: As another tick-borne illness common in New England, the patient's symptoms and history of tick bites are compatible with Anaplasma infection despite negative initial tests. \n8. Infective endocarditis: Fatigue, fever, peripheral embolic phenomena like petechiae, and a history of alcohol use disorder with possible exposure to bacteremia make infective endocarditis a consideration.\n9. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS): The recurrent episodes of thrombosis, history of hematomas, and neurological symptoms may indicate APS, a disorder causing arterial and venous thrombotic events.\n10. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS): Thrombocytopenia, anemia, renal anomalies (hematuria), and recent diarrheal illness suggest the possibility of HUS, typically associated with Shiga-toxin producing E. coli infection."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Andrew J. Cole Neurology: A 20-year-old woman was seen in the neurology clinic of this hospital because of seizures and progressive dystonia. The patient had been well until she was 3 years of age, when she began to have recurrent falls, difficulty walking, and seizures. A diagnostic evaluation at another hospital included a muscle biopsy, electroencephalography, and electroretinog-raphy, as well as analysis of the carnitine profile, visual-evoked potentials, and the enzymatic activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain; the test results were reportedly interpreted as inconclusive. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head was performed; T2-weighted images reportedly showed areas of abnormal hyperintensity in the basal ganglia bilaterally. Therapy with carbamazepine and a multivitamin was initiated. During the next 15 years, progressive stepwise deterioration, including worsening dystonia and dysarthria, occurred; cognitive function was not affected. Exacerbations of her neurologic decline were precipitated by acute intercurrent illnesses and recurrent seizures from which she did not have complete recovery. Five years before the current presentation, anticonvulsant medications were stopped for 1 month. During that period, three flurries of generalized tonic clonic seizures occurred. During admission to a second hospital, the complete blood count, oxygen saturation, blood levels of calcium and magnesium, and results of liver- and renal-function tests were normal. Medications on discharge included carbamazepine, l-carnitine, coenzyme Q10, and vitamin B complex. On follow-up at that hospital 2 months later, the patient reportedly had dysarthria, dystonic posturing of both arms especially the hands, and an ataxic gait. Strength was 35 in the distal arms and 55 in the proximal arms. Approximately 2.8 years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated at a third hospital. MRI of the head was performed; T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR images again showed areas of abnormal hyperintensity in the basal ganglia bilaterally, with mild associated volume loss. The MRI was sig-nificantly degraded by susceptibility artifacts that were produced by orthodontic braces. The blood lactate level was 1.6 mmol per liter 14.4 mg per deciliter; reference range at this hospital, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter 4.5 to 19.8 mg per deciliter, and the cerebrospinal fluid CSF lactate level was 1.2 mmol per liter 10.8 mg per deciliter; reference range at this hospital, 0.6 to 2.2 mmol per liter 5.4 to 19.8 mg per deciliter. A preliminary diagnosis of mitochondrial cy-topathy was made. Between 17 and 11 months before the current presentation, examinations were performed at the second hospital while the patient was receiving levetiracetam and trihexyphenidyl. Speech difficulties, limb rigidity, and spasticity of the left upper leg were noted. She was referred to the epilepsy clinic of this hospital. On presentation to this hospital, the patient reported dysarthric speech and painful dystonia of her hands and limbs particularly her legs. The dystonia was associated with gait deterioration that had led to use of a wheelchair. Cognitive function was not affected. Her most recent seizure had occurred 1 year before this assessment. The patient was the fourth child of healthy consanguineous parents first cousins. She had been born after a full-term gestation, with no complications. Her birth weight was 3750 g. Medications were levetiracetam, pyridoxine, thiamine, and trihexyphenidyl. She had no known allergies. She lived with her family in the Arabian Peninsula; she spoke Arabic and some English, attended a regular high school, and did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. She had three older brothers who were healthy. She had a 6-year-old sister with a similar illness that had started when she was 3 years of age, when she had an episode of bloody diarrhea and then began to have dystonia of the right foot, difficulty walking, and seizures. On evaluation at that time, the sister had a peak blood lactate level of 11.7 mmol per liter 105.4 mg per deciliter and a peak CSF lactate level of 2.3 mmol per liter 20.7 mg per deciliter. Genetic testing for the MELAS syndrome mitochondrial encephalomy-opathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes and the Leigh syndrome was reportedly negative, and levels of urinary organic acids were normal. The sister underwent MRI of the head during the acute phase of her disease. T2-weighted images showed nonenhancing areas of abnormal, diffuse hyperintensity in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, thalami, midbrain, and cerebellum. Repeat imaging studies obtained 10 months later showed resolution of most of the signal abnormalities, although residual signal abnormalities and volume loss were present in the basal ganglia. On examination at this hospital, which was performed with the assistance of an interpreter, the patient was alert and her mental status was normal. She had severe dysarthria, but her speech was fluent, with no paraphasic errors. Cranial-nerve function was intact, and visual acuity was 2030 in both eyes. She had fluctuating dystonia of the hands, arms, legs, and feet that was more prominent on the left side than on the right side. Strength was normal throughout. The plantar reflex was extensor in the left foot and was mute in the right foot; deep-tendon reflexes were normal. The gait was slow, wide-based, and dystonic, with inversion and internal rotation of both feet. The remainder of the examination was normal. MRI of the head was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material. T2-weighted images showed persistent areas of abnormal hyperintensity, volume loss, and subtle abnormal mineralization in the basal ganglia bilaterally. Electroencephalography, which was performed while the patient was awake and while she was asleep, revealed excessive, diffuse beta activity, with no definitive evidence of epi-leptiform abnormalities. The younger sister was present during the clinic visit and was also examined. She had mild dystonia of the right foot, an extensor plantar reflex in the right foot, and a clumsy gait. Dr. Ann L. Hunt: The patient was referred to the movement disorders clinic of this hospital see Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. She came to the visit in a wheelchair. Her speech was dysarthric in both English and Arabic. She had previously been a fluent Arabic speaker. While the patient was sitting quietly, she had dystonic posturing of the left hand and both feet. During any activation procedure, the dystonic posturing of the left hand and left foot increased. During rapid successive movements, slowness and dystonic posturing were more prominent in the left hand and foot than in the right hand and foot. There was no rigidity of the arms or legs. When she walked, dystonic postur-ing was more prominent in the left hand and foot than in the right hand and foot. A pull test revealed good postural stability. A diagnostic test was performed.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Mahesh K. Vidula Medicine: A 41-year-old woman presented to this hospital with chest pain. Approximately 1 year before presentation, the patient had had transient tightness in the chest and shoulder on the left side that had prompted a referral to outpatient physical therapy. Five days before presentation, while the patient was packing for a flight to Boston, acute substernal chest pain developed; the pain radiated to the jaw and shoulders and was accompanied by dyspnea and by a feeling of needing to belch. These symptoms lasted 1 hour and then spontaneously resolved, and she attributed them to fatigue. On the day before presentation, substernal chest pain with radiation to the jaw and shoulders recurred after the patient had been walking, and the pain gradually resolved after a few hours. Before dinner on the evening of presentation, the pain recurred and was associated with light-headedness. The patient attended dinner but had persistent pain, along with dyspnea. She presented to the emergency department of this hospital. On physical examination, the patient was diaphoretic. The temperature was 36.6C, the heart rate 68 beats per minute, the blood pressure 143/87 mm Hg in both arms, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while she was breathing ambient air. She did not have carotid bruits or jugular venous distention, nor did she have cardiac murmur, rub, or gallop on auscultation. Her digits were hyperextensible. The rest of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient had no history of dysrhythmia, heart-failure symptoms, trauma, or constitutional, respiratory, gastrointestinal, or neurologic symptoms. She had undergone a laparoscopy for an ovarian cyst, and she had had a miscarriage 1 month before this evaluation. She took no medications. Penicillin and sulfa drugs caused urticaria. She exercised four times weekly with an elliptical machine and walked her dog daily. She did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs; she consumed two alcoholic beverages per week. She had a healthy 11-year-old daughter. Her father had a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and an embolic stroke. Her mother, brother, and sister had hyper-mobile EhlersDanlos syndrome: her mother had joint hypermobility and had received the diagnosis during her first pregnancy because of recurrent hip subluxations; her brother had joint hyper-mobility and spontaneous pneumothorax and bruised easily; and her sister had joint hypermo-bility and bruised easily. A maternal second cousin had died at 51 years of age from a cerebral aneurysm. Electrocardiography and cardiac imaging studies were performed. Dr. Lucy M. Safi: Electrocardiography showed normal sinus rhythm and submillimeter down-sloping ST-segment depressions in leads V3, V4, and V5 Fig. 1. The depressions had decreased in magnitude on electrocardiography performed 3 hours later and had fully resolved on electrocardiography performed 8 hours after presentation. Transthoracic echocardiography showed overall normal left ventricular and right ventricular systolic function. There was a small, focal area of hypokinesis in the left ventricular inferolateral wall see Videos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. There was no clinically significant valvular stenosis, regurgitation, or pericardial effusion. Although there was increased mobility of the interatrial septum, a color Doppler study showed no evidence of a patent foramen ovale. Dr. Brian B. Ghoshhajra: Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiography showed no abnormali-ties. Computed tomographic CT angiography of the chest was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material with the use of a standard aortic-dissection protocol. There was no evidence of aortic dissection or proximal pulmonary embolism. The aorta appeared normal, with a preserved sinotubular junction, and the ascending aorta and descending aorta each had a normal diameter. There were no other obvious cardiovascular abnormalities, such as aortic or coronary atherosclerosis, cardiomegaly, or pulmonary edema. Dr. Vidula: Aspirin, atorvastatin, and intravenous heparin were administered. Diagnostic tests were performed, and a diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Spontaneous coronary-artery dissection. ", "prediction": "1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's recurrent substernal chest pain radiating to the jaw and shoulders, dyspnea, and transient ST-segment depressions on ECG are indicative of potential ACS.\n2. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): Symptoms such as chest pain associated with a need to belch and the resolution of pain could suggest GERD as a possible cause.\n3. Musculoskeletal Chest Pain: Previous episodes of chest tightness and a history of physical therapy may point to a musculoskeletal origin for chest pain.\n4. Prinzmetal's Angina: Episodic chest pain at rest that resolves spontaneously could be indicative of coronary artery spasm, commonly known as Prinzmetal's angina.\n5. Pulmonary Embolism: Despite a normal CT angiography, the combination of chest pain, dyspnea, and light-headedness warrants consideration of pulmonary embolism.\n6. Aortic Dissection: Severe chest pain radiating to the jaw and shoulders necessitates evaluation for aortic dissection, though imaging results were normal.\n7. Mitral Valve Prolapse: The patient's hyperextensible digits and family history of connective tissue disorders raise the possibility of mitral valve prolapse, despite normal imaging.\n8. Pericarditis: Acute chest pain and dyspnea without typical physical exam findings but supported by echocardiographic abnormalities may suggest pericarditis.\n9. Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS): Given the patient's family history and joint hypermobility, hEDS is a plausible diagnosis that could explain cardiovascular and musculoskeletal symptoms.\n10.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Emer McGrath Neurology: A 32-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital in the fall because of severe headache and loss of peripheral vision. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 4 weeks before admission to this hospital, when she underwent elective termination of pregnancy with methotrexate. The pregnancy had occurred despite the presence of an intrauterine device, and the device was removed a few days after the termination. Oral contraception was initiated. Three weeks later and 1 week before admission to this hospital, pain in the left upper quadrant, vaginal bleeding, and headache developed. The patient was admitted to another hospital. The blood level of human chorionic gonadotropin was 24 IU per liter normal range, 6 IU per liter; the level had been 21,000 IU per liter 3 weeks earlier, when she was pregnant. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, amylase, lipase, total protein, and albumin were normal, as were results of renal-function tests, the prothrombin time, the international normalized ratio, and the partial-thromboplastin time. An examination of a peripheral-blood smear for ba-besia and a direct antiglobulin test were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis Fig. 1, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed splenomegaly spleen length, 15.6 cm in the craniocaudal dimension; normal range, 12 cm, as well as a central filling defect in the splenic vein that was compatible with acute splenic-vein thrombosis. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed low lung volumes, scattered ground-glass opacities, and no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Dr. McGrath: Oral contraception was stopped. On the third hospital day, the patients abdominal pain diminished, and she was discharged home. Four days later, severe bifrontal headache and loss of vision in the left visual field developed. The patient was evaluated by her primary care physician. On examination, she had decreased peripheral vision superiorly and inferiorly in the left visual field. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head was scheduled, but the severity of her headaches increased, and she was evaluated at the other hospital. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Gonzalez: CT of the head and neck Fig. 2 revealed a confluent area of hypodensity and sul-cal effacement involving the superior right parietal lobe that extended inferiorly into the right occipital lobe and the right aspect of the sple-nium of the corpus callosum a finding sugges-tive of a recent infarct and small, focal areas of hyperdensity findings consistent with hemorrhagic conversion. Although a focal occlusive thrombus was not identified, the distal branches of the right posterior cerebral veins were not visible. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital. Dr. McGrath: On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported persistent headache, vision changes in the left visual field, photophobia, phonophobia, and pain with extra-ocular movements. She had a history of chronic back pain that was related to a vertebral disk herniation, for which she had undergone spinal-fusion surgery 4 years before admission to this hospital. During the 3 years before admission, she had had two episodes of self-limited throm-bocytopenia that were thought to be associated with methotrexate treatment for an unknown skin disorder. She had no history of bleeding or clotting disorders and had had no spontaneous miscarriages. She had a 2-year history of waxing-and-waning dull epigastric pain that was associated with nausea and occasional episodes of bilious emesis; the pain partially improved with omeprazole. The patients medications included diclofenac, baclofen, controlled-release morphine sulfate, hydrocodoneacetaminophen, and omeprazole. She had taken oral contraception in the past for extended periods of time. She lived in coastal New England and worked in communications. She drank alcohol occasionally and smoked less than 1 pack of cigarettes per week; she had not smoked during the past few months. She did not use illicit drugs, over-the-counter medications, or herbal medications. There was no family history of bleeding or clotting disorders, spontaneous miscarriage, or hematologic cancer. On examination, the temperature was 38.3C, the blood pressure 126/72 mm Hg, the pulse 54 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was in mild distress because of her headache, but she was alert and oriented to time and place. Examination of the neck, heart, lungs, abdomen, skin, and oral mucosa was normal. Left hom-onymous hemianopia was present; other cranial-nerve functions were normal, although function of the first cranial nerve was not tested. Strength, sensation to light touch, and deep-tendon reflexes of the arms and legs were normal. Fingernose finger testing showed no dysmetria. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear showed 0 to 2 schistocytes per high-power field, teardrop and pencil cells, occasional large platelets, and normal-appearing white cells. Urinalysis showed 1 ketones, 2 blood, 1 protein, 1 urobilinogen, a specific gravity greater than 1.040 normal range, 1.001 to 1.035, and a pH of 5 normal range, 5 to 9 by dipstick; microscopic examination of the sediment revealed no red cells and 3 to 5 white cells per high-power field normal range, 0 to 2. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit of this hospital, and additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Gonzalez: MRI of the head confirmed the infarcts and hemorrhagic conversion that had been seen on CT angiography and venography Fig. 2. A cortical vein was not visible over the lesion, which suggested either cortical-vein thrombosis or secondary compression due to mass effect of the parenchymal lesion. On the second hospital day, transfemoral cerebral angiography Fig. 2 showed multiple cerebral venous thromboses involving the right frontal and parietal cortical veins, with no involvement of the major dural sinuses.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. John H. Stone: A 41-year-old woman was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of headaches and a 6-week history of intermittent, transient vision loss. Four years before the current presentation, a skin eruption on the right foot and a lesion on the tongue developed. A biopsy of both lesions was performed at another hospital; examination of the specimens revealed evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Prednisone, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, and azathioprine were administered, and the mucocutaneous lesions improved, but they recurred after any attempt to taper the immunosuppressive medications. Twenty-one months before the current presentation, headaches developed and skin lesions recurred. The headaches were generally located in the right temporal area, were characterized as throbbing, and lasted approximately 5 to 10 minutes. The patient was evaluated at the other hospital, and magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head with contrast enhancement was performed. Dr. Mary E. Cunnane: Axial, T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR images showed hyperintensity in the right thalamocapsular region and right midbrain, with patchy enhancement of the right midbrain Fig. 1. Dr. Stone: A lumbar puncture was performed. On cerebrospinal fluid CSF analysis, the protein level was 54 mg per deciliter reference range, 5 to 55 and the total nucleated-cell count was 16 per cubic millimeter, with 66 lymphocytes. The opening pressure was not measured. A test for cryptococcal antigen and nucleic-acid tests for toxoplasma, JC virus, herpes simplex virus types I and II, and varicellazoster virus were negative. Flow cytometry did not show any abnormal cell populations. Screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus and syphilis were negative. A presumptive diagnosis of central nervous system CNS vasculitis was made. Prednisone, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and hydroxychloroquine were administered, and the headaches improved temporarily. Two months later, repeat MRI of the head reportedly showed resolution of the hyperintensity that had been seen previously. Eighteen months before the current presentation, the patient was referred to the rheumatol-ogy clinic at this hospital for the evaluation of recurrent painful mucocutaneous lesions of the hands, feet, and mouth. She also reported fatigue and arthralgias of the hands, knees, and ankles. Blood tests revealed antinuclear antibodies at a titer of 1:5120, with a speckled pattern and anti-Ro antibodies 154.60 optical-density units; normal range, 19.99, as well as hypocomplementemia. A diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus SLE was suspected. Pred-nisone and hydroxychloroquine were continued, and mycophenolate mofetil was added to the regimen. Cyclophosphamide and rituximab were stopped. Over the next 15 months, the patient had exacerbations of the cutaneous vasculitis whenever the prednisone dose was tapered. Three months before the current presentation, the prednisone dose was increased because of worsening lesions on the hands and feet. During the 6 weeks before this presentation, sporadic episodes of transient vision loss occurred. The episodes lasted 5 to 10 seconds, occurred one to several times per day, and remitted spontaneously. They were associated with dizziness, pul-satile tinnitus, and headaches. The headaches reportedly worsened with changes in position, such as bending over, but there appeared to be no relationship between the headaches and time of day, diet, activity, or performance of the Val-salva maneuver. The patient was evaluated by an ophthalmologist 1 week before the current presentation and then evaluated by her neurologist at another facility 6 days later. On neurologic evaluation, the blood pressure was 114/72 mm Hg. Bilateral optic-disk swelling was noted, but the remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. MRI of the head was performed. One day later, the patient was evaluated by her rheumatologist at this hospital. She reported ongoing mucocutaneous symptoms, including painful swelling on the right lip, a painful ulcer on the palate, and pruritic lesions on the feet. There was no diplopia, neck stiffness, photopho-bia, sonophobia, general or focal weakness, par-esthesia, ataxia, syncope, fever, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, or bowel or bladder dysfunction. The patients medical history was notable for weight gain of 22.7 kg over a 4-year period in the context of glucocorticoid treatment and glucocorticoid-related osteoporosis. Her medications included prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, mycophenolate mofetil, alendronate, calcium, and vitamin D. Rituximab had been readministered 9 days earlier. The patient was originally from the eastern Mediterranean and had immigrated to the United States 20 years earlier. She was divorced and had one adolescent son. She had previously worked in the restaurant business but had to discontinue this work because of physical limitations. She had an 8.5-pack-year history of cigarette smoking and continued to smoke several cigarettes a day, but she did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother had coronary artery disease, her father had valvular heart disease, and her maternal grandmother had had a stroke. Her sisters were healthy, and there was no family history of neurologic, ophthalmologic, or rheumatologic disease. On examination, the temperature was 37C, the pulse 109 beats per minute, the blood pressure 129/78 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 94 kg. The patient appeared mildly unwell, was tearful, and had cushingoid features. The bilateral optic-disk swelling was confirmed, but the remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. A small pink lump was noted on the right upper lip, and an ulcer was present on the hard palate. There were multiple splinterlike ulcerations on the fingers, nonblanching tender patches with a livedoid pattern and excoriations on the toes, and purple papules on the feet. Laboratory test results obtained 9 days before the current presentation are shown in Table 1. The patient was referred for an ophthalmo-logic examination. Visual acuity without glasses was 2015 in the right eye and 2015 in the left eye. The pupils were equal in size and had a normal response to light. Results of testing with the use of an Amsler grid and an Ishihara color plate were within normal limits. Humphrey visual-field testing revealed enlarged blind spots in both eyes. Applanation tonometry revealed an intraocular pressure of 11 mm Hg in the right eye and 10 mm Hg in the left eye. On external examination, the eyelids and ocular adnexa were normal. Results of a slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination were normal in both eyes. A dilated-pupil fundus examination revealed extensive bilateral optic-disk edema grade 4 on the Frisen scale, which ranges from 0 to 5, with higher grades indicating more severe edema and associated subretinal fluid, as well as peripapillary folds in the left eye and multiple peripapillary hemorrhages in both eyes. There were splinter and subretinal hemorrhages and changes in the macular pigment in both eyes. A diagnosis was made.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Micaela R. Atkins Pediatrics: A 5-month-old boy was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit ICU of this hospital for evaluation of suspected hypoglycemia. The patient was born at another hospital after 40 weeks 4 days of gestation. His mother had had a positive 1-hour glucose challenge test and a negative 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test during pregnancy. Terminal meconium was present at delivery; the 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were 8 and 9, respectively. At birth, the weight was 3.6 kg 72nd percentile Fig. 1. Within the patients first hour of life, respiratory distress developed. The blood glucose level was reportedly 4 mg per deciliter 0.2 mmol per liter and remained low despite oral intake of formula. The patient was admitted to the special care nursery, where intravenous fluids that contained dextrose were administered; the blood glucose level normalized and the respiratory distress resolved. A blood culture was sent, and ampicillin and gentamicin were administered. On the patients third day of life, the blood culture remained negative. Antibiotic agents and intravenous fluids were discontinued, breast-feeding was initiated, and a blood glucose level of more than 50 mg per deciliter 2.8 mmol per liter was maintained. While the patient was in the special care nursery, he had occasional brief episodes of bradycardia, with heart rates between 70 and 80 beats per minute normal heart rate in this patients age group, 120 to 160 beats per minute. The low heart rates were not associated with apnea or cyanosis, and each episode resolved spontaneously. In addition, the systolic blood pressure was elevated 92 to 97 mm Hg, with equal measurements in the arms and legs. Brachial femoral delay was absent, and the results of pulse oximetry in the right hand and right foot were normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and creatinine were normal, as were the results of electrocardiography, renal ultrasonography, and newborn blood-spot screening a panel of tests for multiple congenital diseases, primarily inborn errors of metabolism. The patient was discharged home on the seventh day of life. The patient was well until 7 weeks of age (approximately 3.5 months before the current admission), when abdominal breathing and grunting respirations developed during the night. He had consumed a smaller volume of breast milk than usual at 6 p.m., and he awakened 3 hours later but quickly fell asleep again using a pacifier, without feeding. He slept through his usual midnight feeding, and when his mother checked on him around that time, he felt warm and seemed to be breathing heavily, with pronounced movement of the abdomen with respiration. The patient awoke at 3 a.m. and avidly consumed breast milk, but he had grunting respirations and persistent abdominal breathing that prompted his mother to take him to the emergency department of a second hospital. On physical examination, the patient had tachypnea and a rectal temperature of 38.1°C. The white-cell count was 20,300 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 5500 to 18,000), the anion gap 26 millimoles per liter (reference range, 3 to 11), the blood bicarbonate level 9 mmol per liter (reference range, 21 to 32), and the blood glucose level 182 mg per deciliter (10.1 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 106 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 5.9 mmol per liter]). A blood culture was sent. The results of chest and abdominal radiography were reportedly normal. Ceftriaxone and normal saline were administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred to a third hospital for further treatment. On arrival at the third hospital, the patient fed without difficulty and appeared well. Vital signs and results of a physical examination were normal; the weight was 5.0 kg (39th percentile), and the length 57 cm (45th percentile) (Figure 1). Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed clear, colorless urine with a specific gravity of 1.005 and a pH of 6.0; ketones were absent. A urine culture was sent. The patient was observed for 48 hours; during that time, he appeared well and the blood and urine cultures remained negative. On the third hospital day, the patient was discharged home. His primary care pediatrician advised avoidance of intervals longer than 6 hours between feedings. One day before the current admission, the patient’s mother called the primary care pediatrician to report the following events: when the patient awoke that morning after a 6-hour fast, he had tachypnea; he then drank a bottle of infant formula; 1 hour later, grunting respirations developed; he drank an additional ounce of formula; his ventilatory efforts normalized over the next 45 minutes; and he appeared well throughout the remainder of the day. On further recall, the patient’s mother reported that there had been one other morning within the past 2 weeks during which the patient had been irritable and had had tachypnea on awakening after a 6-hour fast, with rapid resolution of these symptoms after feeding. On the day of admission, the pediatrician had a telephone consultation with a pediatric endocrinologist, who recommended elective admission of the patient to the pediatric ICU at this hospital for a diagnostic fast. On the patient’s admission to the pediatric ICU, history was obtained from the patient’s mother. She reported that the infant’s diet had changed from breast milk to a partially hydrolyzed cow’s milk–based infant formula between 1 and 2 weeks earlier; the patient had also recently begun eating rice cereal. His most recent feed, which consisted of approximately 105 ml of formula, had taken place 2.5 hours before admission. There had been no concerns about the patient’s growth or acquisition of developmental milestones. He had a history of a small umbilical hernia and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included ranitidine and vitamin D; there were no known allergies. Immunizations were current. The patient lived with his parents, older sister, and pet dog, and he did not attend day care. His paternal grandmother had type 2 diabetes mellitus. On physical examination, the patient was alert, smiling, and interactive. The temperature was 37.1°C, the pulse 136 beats per minute, the blood pressure 113//55 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 48 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 7.2 kg (33rd percentile), the length 62 cm (3rd percentile), and the head circumference 41 cm (9th percentile) (Figure 1). Doll-like facies were present, with full cheeks and deep-set eyes. The abdomen was protuberant; the remainder of the examination was normal. In preparation for the planned fast, a baseline point-of-care blood glucose level was measured, with a result of 39 mg per deciliter (2.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). A whole-blood specimen was obtained for measurement of the pyruvate level, and a plasma specimen was obtained for measurement of the levels of carnitine and acylcarnitines; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Thirty minutes later, a point-of-care blood glucose level was 13 mg per deciliter (0.7 mmol per liter). A serum specimen was obtained for measurement of the levels of insulin, C-peptide, cortisol, human growth hormone, and free fatty acids. Glucagon was administered intramuscularly. Ten minutes later, a point-of-care blood glucose level was less than 10 mg per deciliter (<0.6 mmol per liter); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The respiratory rate was 58 breaths per minute, and the results of the physical examination were otherwise unchanged. The fast was ended, and the patient drank 120 ml of formula; 1 hour later, the blood glucose level was 73 mg per deciliter (41 mmol per liter). Urinalysis revealed trace ketones. The next morning, the insulin result became available; the level was 6.0 μIU per milliliter (reference range, 2.6 to 25.0), and the specimen was noted to be hemolyzed. Additional tests were performed, and a diagnosis was made. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Glycogen storage disease type Ia. ", "prediction": "1. Congenital Hyperinsulinism: Given the recurrent hypoglycemia with inappropriately normal insulin levels during hypoglycemia, this suggests excessive insulin production, commonly seen in congenital hyperinsulinism.\n2. Glycogen Storage Disease (GSD): The hypoglycemia, especially during fasting, along with a protuberant abdomen, may indicate a form of GSD, such as GSD Type I (Von Gierke's disease).\n3. Ketotic Hypoglycemia: The presence of hypoglycemia with trace ketones in the urine suggests the possibility of ketotic hypoglycemia, which typically presents in young children during fasting states.\n4. Growth Hormone Deficiency: The child’s hypoglycemia could be related to an endocrine deficiency, such as growth hormone, given its role in glucose regulation.\n5. Adrenal Insufficiency: Given the hypoglycemia and elevated pulse, it is possible that adrenal insufficiency, characterized by inadequate cortisol production, may be at play.\n6. Fatty Acid Oxidation Defect: A fatty acid oxidation disorder could explain the hypoglycemia without significant ketosis, given its role in providing energy during fasting.\n7. Sepsis: Although less likely due to lack of positive cultures, recurrent hypoglycemia and an elevated white-cell count could indicate an occult infection or sepsis.\n8. Panhypopituitarism: Given the multiple abnormal blood parameters, including the hypoglycemia and potential for failure in other axes, panhypopituitarism should be considered.\n9. Metabolic Acidosis (e.g., Organic Acidemia): The elevated anion gap and history of metabolic acidosis could indicate an inborn error of metabolism such as organic acidemia.\n10.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Madeleine I. Matthiesen Medicine and Pediatrics: A newborn boy was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit ICU of this hospital because of thrombocyto-penia and abnormal results on an eye examination for red reflex and on a hearing screening. The patient was born to a 27-year-old mother gravida 2, para 2 by spontaneous vaginal delivery at another hospital after an uncomplicated gestation of 39 weeks 4 days. His mother had received prenatal care in Nigeria and had also been seen by an obstetrician in New England for one office visit at 24 weeks 4 days of gestation. At that appointment, results of an ultrasonographic survey of the fetal anatomy were normal, and antepartum screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and syphilis were negative. A maternal test for IgG antibodies to rubella virus was positive 500 IU per milliliter; reference range for immunity, 9.9, as was a test for IgG antibodies to vari-cellazoster virus. The maternal ABO blood type was O, Rh positive, and screening for antibodies to red cells was negative; hemoglobin electrophoresis revealed the presence of hemoglobin AS. The mother traveled back to Nigeria before returning to New England at 34 weeks of gestation in anticipation of the birth. At delivery, meconium was present. The 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were 7 and 8, respectively. The birth weight was 3.21 kg 54th percentile, the length 51 cm 72nd percentile, and the head circumference 33.5 cm 22nd percentile. The newborn had tremulous movements of the arms and legs, and the blood glucose level was reportedly 20 mg per deciliter 1.1 mmol per liter. He was admitted to the special care nursery at the other hospital, where intravenous fluids that contained dextrose were administered and breast-feeding was initiated; the blood glucose level normalized. On examination of the newborn the following day, the vital signs were normal. Scattered petechiae were present on the face, and an eye examination revealed that the red reflex was absent in the left eye and decreased in the right eye. The platelet count was 18,000 per cubic millimeter reference range, 150,000 to 450,000. Newborn blood-spot screening tests a panel of tests for multiple congenital diseases, primarily inborn errors of metabolism revealed the presence of hemoglobin FAS and were otherwise negative. On a hearing screening, no auditory brain-stem response was detected when the test sound was presented to either ear. A polymerase-chain-reaction PCR assay for cytomegalovirus DNA in the urine was negative, as was a maternal rapid plasma reagin test. At 48 hours of age, the patient was transferred to the neonatal ICU of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. The history was obtained from the patients mother. She reported that she was unsure whether the newborn responded to her voice or other sounds. She had received treatment for malaria during the first trimester of pregnancy and had received amoxicillinclavulanate for a respiratory tract infection during the early part of the third trimester. The family lived in an urban area of Nigeria, where the parents worked in the banking sector and employed a live-in nanny to help care for the patients 3-year-old sister. They did not have pets and had not noted rodents or other pests in their home. The patients mother, father, and sister were healthy. During the mothers previous pregnancy, prenatal care had taken place exclusively in Nigeria; the child had been delivered in the southeastern United States, and the mother and child had traveled back to Nigeria shortly after the birth. Otherwise, the mother had not traveled internationally; the father had traveled to China for business during the past year. On examination in the neonatal ICU, the newborn was awake and appeared well, and the vital signs were normal. Scattered petechiae were present on the face. The red reflex was absent in both eyes. A systolic ejection murmur grade 26 was heard in the left upper chest. Mild hepato-splenomegaly was present. Increased muscle tone was present in the arms and legs, and intermittent, suppressible, rapid shaking movements occurred in the arms. The remainder of the ex-amination was normal. The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, red-cell count, red-cell indexes, and blood levels of glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal, as were the results of coagulation tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A blood sample was obtained for culture. Ampicillin and gentamicin were administered intravenously, and platelets were transfused. Dr. Katherine Nimkin: Cranial ultrasonography was performed through the anterior fontanelle Fig. 1. Sagittal images showed multiple punc-tate, echogenic foci in the periventricular white matter bilaterally, a finding consistent with calcifications. Punctate calcifications were also pres-ent in the basal ganglia. Complex subependymal cysts were seen in the caudothalamic grooves bilaterally; these were larger on the left side than on the right side. There was mild dilatation of the left lateral ventricle. Linear, branching, echo-genic foci were present in the basal ganglia bi-laterally, a finding consistent with lenticulostriate vasculopathy. In this patient, chest radiography Fig. 2A revealed a normal heart and mediastinum and clear lungs. There were thin, transverse lucent bands in the proximal humeral metaphyses bilaterally. Metaphyseal lucent bands in the neonate may result from changes associated with chronic stress or from congenital infections. Other causes of metaphyseal lucent bands include metastatic neuroblastoma and leukemia. Abdominal ultrasonography confirmed the finding of hepatosplenomegaly Fig. 2B.

Cohen Medicine: A 63-year-old man was admitted to this hospital with confusion and weakness 5 months after he had undergone allogeneic stem-cell transplantation for chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL. The patient had been generally well until 2 years before this admission, when routine tests performed at another hospital revealed a white-cell count of 57,000 per cubic millimeter. A diagnosis of CLL with chromosome 17p deletion was made. Approximately 21 months before this admission, the patient was seen by an oncologist at a second hospital, and he was referred to the Cancer Center of this hospital. Shortly thereafter, chest pain and dyspnea occurred. A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was made, and warfarin therapy was begun. Two weeks later, on evaluation in the Cancer Center, warfarin therapy was stopped and treatment with ibrutinib and enoxaparin was begun. Five months before this admission, the patient underwent allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, at this hospital, from a matched, unrelated donor after reduced-intensity conditioning with fludarabine and melphalan. Post-transplantation complications included the engraftment syndrome with respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation, hemolysis caused by ABO incompatibility, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, delirium, and fevers. An evaluation of delirium included magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head and lumbar puncture. The opening pressure was 34 cm of water normal range, 10 to 20, and cerebro-spinal fluid CSF analysis revealed a red-cell count of 255 per cubic millimeter, a glucose level of 125 mg per deciliter 6.9 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter 2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter, a total protein level of 26 mg per deciliter reference range, 5 to 55, and a nucleated-cell count of 28 per cubic millimeter 90 lymphocytes. Culture of the CSF was sterile, and nucleic acid testing for herpes simplex virus was negative. The delirium was thought to be related to medications or the engraftment syndrome, and after several days, the mental status improved. Thirty-eight days before this admission, pathological examination of a bone marrowbiopsy specimen and fluorescence in situ hybridization testing showed evidence of trilineage hemato-poiesis and residual CLL. Thirty-five days before this admission, fever and abdominal pain developed, and the patient underwent cholecystectomy for acute gangrenous cholecystitis. Twelve days before the current admission, the patient was admitted to this hospital because of weight loss of 34 kg during the previous 4 months. A chest radiograph showed a left basilar opacity. Examination and culture of biopsy specimens obtained with the use of upper endoscopy and sigmoidoscopy showed no evidence of gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease GVHD, candidiasis, or invasive cytomega-lovirus CMV infection. There was delayed gastric emptying. The patient declined parenteral and percutaneous enteral nutrition, and dronabi-nol therapy was initiated. During that admission, the patient had episodes of mild confusion, and fever to a temperature of 38.6C occurred on the fourth hospital day. Dr. Pamela W. Schaefer: On the fifth hospital day, MRI of the head was performed after the administration of contrast material. Axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR images showed subtle hyperintensity in the occipital sulci bilaterally. Gadolinium-enhanced axial T1 -weighted images showed subtle enhancement in some of the occipital sulci. These findings could represent a subtle inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic leptomeningeal process or could be artifactual. On a coronal FLAIR image, the hippo-campi appeared normal and there was a nonspecific hyperintense focus in the right corona radiata, a common finding in a patient of this age. The hippocampi also appeared normal on axial T2-weighted images and axial diffusion-weighted images. A sagittal T1-weighted image showed a low signal in the calvarial bone marrow that was most likely due to the known CLL or to a reactive change. There was no evidence of acute ischemia, intracranial hemorrhage, mass lesion, cortical abnormality, or brain swelling. Dr. Cohen: Empirical ceftazidime, metronida-zole, and fluconazole were administered, and mirtazapine therapy was begun. Blood cultures were negative. Urinalysis revealed 1 protein, 1 leukocyte esterase, and 1 bacteria, and a urine culture grew few Klebsiella pneumoniae. The fevers resolved and the confusion diminished, with some residual forgetfulness and fogginess. The patient was discharged home on the ninth hospital day. One day before this admission, the patient reportedly fell and hit his head. He was taken to the emergency department of the second hospital. On evaluation, he was awake, agitated, and confused, with generalized weakness. Haloperi-dol was administered. The patient was transferred to the oncology unit of this hospital. The patient had a history of treated hepatitis C virus infection, hypertension, and migraines. Medications were ibrutinib, famciclovir, siroli-mus, tacrolimus, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, dronabinol, mirtazapine, olanzapine, ursodiol, nystatin suspension, omeprazole, cholecalciferol, and zinc acetate, as well as lorazepam as needed. He had no known allergies to medications. He lived with his longtime partner and worked in the entertainment industry. He had a 45-pack-year history of cigarette smoking and had quit 5 months earlier; he had previously stopped drinking alcohol after a period of heavy use of unknown duration, and he had used intranasal cocaine in the remote past. His family history was notable for breast cancer in his mother and liver cancer in his brother. He had one healthy adult child. On examination, the temperature was 37.4C, the pulse 102 beats per minute, the blood pressure 142/79 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air. He had cachexia, appeared fatigued, and was oriented to person but not to place or time. He could not name the president of the United States or the days of the week, and he had difficulty following commands. He made inappropriate comments, reported visual hallucinations including smoke coming out of the doctors nose, and picked at the bedsheets. The mucous membranes were dry. There was a small amount of dried blood above his left eye and outer left ear. An ejection murmur was heard in the pre-cordium. An intention tremor was present in each arm. Asterixis was absent. Strength was 45 in both arms and 45 in both legs. The remainder of the general and neurologic examinations, including examination of the function of cranial nerves II through XII, was normal. Blood levels of thyrotropin, alanine amino-transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase, and vitamin B12 were normal, as was the serum osmolality; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed clear urine, with no nitrite or leukocyte esterase, 0 to 2 white cells per high-power field, and 1 bacteria. Urine and blood samples were obtained for culture, and additional imaging studies were performed. Dr. Schaefer: A chest radiograph showed clear lungs. Sagittal, axial, and coronal images from computed tomography CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, showed no evidence of brain swelling, edema, ischemia, hemorrhage, or other acute intracranial abnormalities. Dr. Cohen: Electroencephalography showed diffuse slowing of the theta waveform frequency, predominantly in the frontal area, but no epilepti-form discharges. On the second hospital day, an attempt to perform a lumbar puncture was unsuccessful because the patient was not able to follow commands. On the third hospital day, a lumbar puncture was successfully performed and revealed an opening pressure of 17 cm of water; results of CSF analysis are shown in Table 1. Diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Human herpesvirus 6–related encephalitis. ", "prediction": "1. Central Nervous System Infection: Considering the patient's confusion, past history of stem-cell transplantation, and recent fall, a central nervous system infection such as meningitis or encephalitis needs to be considered, especially with CSF abnormalities in past tests.\n2. Drug-Induced Delirium: The patient's medication list includes multiple agents that can potentially cause delirium, such as haloperidol, ibrutinib, and olanzapine.\n3. Metabolic Encephalopathy: The patient's confusion could be due to metabolic imbalances related to his recent intense weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, or organ dysfunction.\n4. Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD): Given the recent allogeneic stem cell transplantation, GVHD involving the CNS or other organs might explain his symptoms.\n5. Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia status post-transplant puts the patient at risk for secondary malignancies such as PTLD, which can present with neurological symptoms.\n6. Subdural Hematoma: The recent fall and head injury increase the risk of a subdural hematoma, which can manifest with confusion and neurological changes even in the absence of acute findings on initial imaging.\n7. Hepatic Encephalopathy: History of hepatitis C and recent development of asterixis-like symptoms (tremor) suggest potential hepatic encephalopathy.\n8. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML): As a patient on immunosuppressive therapy post-transplant, PML caused by JC virus could manifest with neurological deficits and progressive cognitive decline.\n9.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Ethan I. Meltzer Neurology: A 25-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of new-onset seizures. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 days before admission, when episodes of twitching of the head and neck occurred. The first episode occurred after he awoke in the morning, and the second occurred 2 hours later; each of these episodes lasted approximately 1 minute. A third episode occurred 4 hours after he awoke, lasted 2 minutes, and was accompanied by stiffness of the left arm and left leg; the patient was aware of the twitching and stiffness but did not recall the subsequent events. Observers report that the patients full body shook and that he lost consciousness and fell, striking his face. He stopped shaking after a few minutes and regained consciousness, but he was confused and was taken by emergency medical services to another hospital for evaluation. At the other hospital, another self-limited episode with full-body shaking and loss of consciousness reportedly occurred, and levetiracetam was administered. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Susie Y. Huang: Computed tomography CT of the head, face, and cervical spine, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed minimally displaced fractures of the nasal bones bilaterally Fig. 1A but no acute intracranial process or fractures of the cervical spine. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed restricted diffusion in the cortex of the right superior frontal gyrus Fig. 1B and 1C. T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed marked hyperintensity in the cortex and white matter of the adjacent right frontal lobe Fig. 1D, a finding consistent with vasogenic edema. Two-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance venography of the head revealed evidence of thrombosis or slow flow in the anterior aspect of the superior sagittal sinus Fig. 1E. Susceptibility-weighted images of the head showed prominent linear hypointensity and evidence of cortical-vein thrombosis Fig. 1F. Dr. Meltzer: Intravenous unfractionated heparin was administered. The patient was transferred to the neurology inpatient service of this hospital. On arrival at this hospital, the patient reported no headache, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, or dizziness. He had no history of bleeding or clotting disorders. Three years before admission, he had been involved in a motor vehicle accident related to falling asleep while driving. A CT scan of the head obtained at that time was reportedly normal, and antiepileptic medications were not prescribed. The patient had a tall stature and long arms; 10 years before admission, he had undergone cardiac evaluation after a family member in the health care field suggested the possibility that he had Marfans syndrome. Trans-thoracic echocardiography performed at that time reportedly showed normal size and function of the right and left ventricles, no clinically significant valvular disease, and a normal aortic root and ascending aorta. The patient had a history of myopia and had used corrective lenses since he was 15 years of age. Three years before admission, during an ophthalmologic evaluation for laser-assisted refractive surgery, he had received a diagnosis of ectopia lentis with downward lens dislocation in both eyes. The ophthalmologist recommended repeat cardiac evaluation for Marfans syndrome, and a transthoracic echocardiogram obtained at that time was again normal. Four years before admission, the patient had undergone cholecystectomy. He had a history of attention deficithyperactivity disorder; his mother reported that he had had delays in reaching developmental milestones as a child and had followed an individualized educational plan for a learning disorder. He took no medications. His mother had hypercholesterol-emia, his maternal grandmother had dementia and seizures, and his paternal grandfather had died after a stroke when he was 70 years of age. There was no family history of clotting disorders, congenital heart disease, or sudden cardiac death. The patient was a college student, and he did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. On examination, the temperature was 36.9C, the blood pressure 11280 mg Hg, the pulse 55 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 189 cm, the weight 76 kg, the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 21, and the arm span 192.5 cm. The distance from the top of the pubic symphysis to the floor was 105 cm while he was in the standing position. The patient was fully alert and oriented. He had complete fluency, with no paraphasic errors or dysarthria. His concentration and attention were intact. His memory was limited, with intact registration but poor recall. The visual fields were full in response to confrontation. The pupils were equal and reactive to light. There was no ptosis, and extraocular movements were intact, with no nystagmus or saccadic pursuit. On the face, sensations to light touch and temperature were normal. There was no facial asymmetry. The tongue and palate were midline, and the hearing was normal in response to a finger rub. The patient was able to shrug his shoulders and turn his head. His muscle bulk and tone were normal. He did not have cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, pronator drift, fasciculations, myoc-lonus, or tremor. Throughout the body, strength was full. Proprioception and sensations to light touch, temperature, pinprick, and vibration were intact. Deep-tendon reflexes were normal, and the toes were downgoing bilaterally. Results of fingernosefinger and heel-to-shin tests were normal. Excoriations and ecchymoses were present on the nasal bridge and forehead. The patient had a high arched palate and slight pectus excavatum, and striae were present on his back. When he wrapped a hand around the contralat-eral wrist, the top of the thumb covered the entire fingernail of the fifth finger. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of a urinalysis, urine toxicology screen, and tests of renal and liver function. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with intravenous unfrac-tionated heparin was continued. Dr. Huang: CT angiography of the head was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. It revealed a nonocclu-sive filling defect in the anterior aspect of the superior sagittal sinus, a filling defect in the cortical vein of the right frontal lobe, a punctate filling defect in the left internal jugular vein, and an area of mild hypodensity and swelling in the middle aspect of the right superior frontal gyrus, with no associated hemorrhage.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Robert H. Goldstein Medicine: A 55-year-old man with Crohns disease and a new diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 HIV-1 infection was seen in the infectious diseases clinic of this hospital because of a mass on the right side of the face. Fifteen days before the current evaluation, while the patient was undergoing extraction of carious teeth, a health care worker sustained a needlestick injury, which prompted evaluation of the patient for infections caused by bloodborne pathogens. Hepatitis C virus antibodies were not detected, but a rapid screening test for HIV antibodies was positive, as was a fourth-generation combination assay for HIV-1 and HIV type 2 HIV-2 antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen. A supplemental Western blot assay confirmed the diagnosis of HIV-1. The plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load was 69,300 copies per milliliter, and the blood CD4 T-cell count was 65 per cubic millimeter reference range, 348 to 1456. The patient was referred to the infectious diseases clinic of this hospital for treatment. Eight days later, 1 week before the current evaluation, the patient was seen in the infectious diseases clinic. He reported that he had lost approximately 18 kg during the past 2 years, that he had chronic orodental pain and a chronic cough at night, and that the skin on his forehead, cheeks, and chest was peeling. He had Crohns disease, for which a total colectomy had been performed during childhood; he had been evaluated on multiple occasions during the past year for increased ostomy output and dehydration. He had no known history of sexually transmitted infections. Fourteen years earlier, the patient had undergone fine-needle aspiration of an enlarged lymph node on the right side of the neck. Cytologic examination of the aspirate revealed findings consistent with reactive hyperplasia, with no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell or unusual T-cell population. Nineteen months before the current evaluation, an excisional biopsy of a mass on the right side of the neck had been performed. Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed an enlarged lymph node with florid follicular and paracortical hyperplasia. The patient took diazepam and had no known allergies to medications. He resided in an urban area of New England. He was retired and had previously worked for the government. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He reported that he had never had sex but that he had been assaulted in the past. His mother had had lung cancer, and his father had had congestive heart failure. On examination in the clinic, the patient appeared anxious. The vital signs were normal, and the weight was 75.7 kg; 2 years earlier, the weight had been 93.2 kg. The maxilla was eden-tulous, and the few remaining mandibular teeth appeared carious. The abdomen was scaphoid, with an ostomy in the right lower quadrant, and the skin on the face and chest was erythematous and peeling; the remainder of the examination was normal. The anion gap and blood levels of glucose, calcium, alanine aminotransferase, as-partate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, vitamin B12, folic acid, testosterone, and glycated hemoglobin were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Topical ketoconazolebased shampoo, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, and a fixed-dose formulation of elvitegravir, cobicistat, em-tricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide were prescribed. One week later, the patient returned to the infectious diseases clinic for follow-up the current evaluation and reported that a lump had developed on the right side of his face. He had adhered to the prescribed regimen, and his appetite had increased during the past week. On examination, the vital signs were normal, and the weight was 76.7 kg. At the angle of the right mandible, there was a firm, fixed, tender mass measuring 0.5 cm in diameter, with no overlying erythema or warmth. The erythema of the skin on the face and chest had decreased; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. An interferon- release assay for a cell-mediated immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Chest radiography revealed minimal linear and reticular opacities in the right middle lobe, lingula, and left lower lobe; these findings had not changed from previous examinations. A follow-up appointment was arranged for the following week. One week after this evaluation, repeat examination in the infectious diseases clinic revealed that the size of the mass on the right side of the face had increased to 1 cm in diameter. One week later, the size of the mass had increased to 1.5 cm in diameter, and numbness of the right pinna had developed. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Hillary R. Kelly: Computed tomography CT of the neck Fig. 1A and 1B revealed asymmetric enlargement of the right parotid gland, with no surrounding inflammatory change. There was an ill-defined, central focus of hypoattenuation in the right parotid gland, a finding that raised concerns about a fluid collection or mass lesion. Scattered cervical lymph nodes were seen throughout the neck; these nodes were thought to be larger and more numerous than expected for an otherwise healthy 55-year-old patient but did not meet the size criteria for enlargement due to cancer. CT of the head revealed enlargement of the prepontine and premedullary cisterns and of the fourth ventricle, a finding that reflected disproportionate volume loss in the brain stem relative to the cerebral hemispheres. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI was recommended for further characterization of the facial mass. MRI of the neck was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material Fig. 1C through 1F. A large, multilobulated mass or confluent cluster of nodules occupied most of the deep and superficial lobes of the right parotid gland, extending through and widening the stylomandibular tunnel. There was a small rind of normal parotid parenchyma surrounding this mass. The mass had an isointense signal on T1-weighted imaging, restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging, and heterogeneous enhancement on contrast-enhanced imaging. There was a central focus of hypointense signal on T2-weighted imaging that corresponded to the focus of hypoattenuation that had been seen on the CT scan of the neck. The maximum dimensions of the mass were 4.2 cm transverse by 3.3 cm anteroposterior by 5.6 cm craniocaudal; the parotid gland was more enlarged than it had been on the CT scan. The lesion bowed the external carotid artery anteriorly and abutted the posterior border of the mandibular ramus; there was no evidence of cortical erosion or abnormal signal in the marrow. The fat adjacent to the stylomastoid foramen was preserved, and there was no abnormal enhancement along the intra-temporal segment of the right facial nerve or along the auriculotemporal nerve that would suggest perineural spread. In addition, there were multiple enlarged cervical nodes bilaterally, findings consistent with those seen on the CT scan of the neck. Dr. Goldstein: A diagnostic procedure was performed.

HIV-associated salivary gland disease: Given the patient's recent HIV diagnosis and CD4 count of 65, HIV-associated salivary gland disease is a likely cause of the parotid gland enlargement.\n\n2. Lymphoma: The rapid increase in the size of the mass and the patient's history of significant weight loss, chronic immunosuppression, and enlarged cervical lymph nodes raise the possibility of lymphoma.\n\n3. Kaposi's sarcoma: This is common in HIV patients and could present as a mass in the parotid gland, although typically it involves the skin and mucous membranes.\n\n4. Tuberculosis: Despite a negative interferon release assay, cutaneous or extrapulmonary TB could present with a mass, especially since the patient has chronic symptoms and had exposure to bloodborne pathogens.\n\n5. Bacterial sialadenitis: An infection of the salivary gland could present with a firm, tender mass, although the lack of overt erythema or warmth makes this less likely.\n\n6. Parotid gland abscess: Although there is no sign of overt infection, the hypoattenuation on imaging could suggest an abscess within the gland.\n\n7. Metastatic cancer: Given his age and family history of lung cancer, metastasis from an unknown primary site cannot be ruled out.\n\n8. Sjögren's syndrome: This autoimmune condition can cause chronic parotid gland enlargement and has been associated with other autoimmune diseases, but it would be less likely with this presentation.\n\n9. Castleman disease: This rare condition can cause lymph node enlargement and could be considered given the mass and the patient's immunosuppressive status due to HIV.\n\n10.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Samir Zaidi Medicine: A 48-year-old woman with a history of venous thrombo-embolism was seen in the pulmonary clinic of this hospital because of cough and decreased exercise tolerance. Fifteen months before this presentation, at another hospital, the patient received a diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis of the right leg and segmental and subsegmental pulmonary embolism in both lower lobes. Blood tests for a factor V Leiden mutation and a prothrombin gene mutation were reportedly negative, as were tests for antiphospholipid, anticardiolipin, and 2-glycoprotein antibodies; the blood level of protein S was reportedly low. Treatment with warfarin was initiated. After 3 months of treatment, the patient had persistent cough and dyspnea on exertion, and repeat imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Shaunagh McDermott: Twelve months before this presentation, computed tomographic CT angiography of the chest was performed at the other hospital. There was pulmonary embolism in the right lung, with occlusion of the interlobar pulmonary artery that extended into the middle and lower lobes, including segmental arteries. There was also a new focal dilatation 1.1 cm in diameter of the pulmonary artery in the left lower lobe, as well as a new small right pleural effusion Fig. 1. Dr. Zaidi: Warfarin was discontinued, and treatment with apixaban was initiated. After 6 months of treatment, additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. McDermott: Six months before this presentation, CT angiography of the chest was performed at the other hospital. A large pulmonary embolus occluded the distal right main pulmonary artery, and the previously identified pulmonary em-boli had not resolved. The dilatation of the pulmonary artery in the left lower lobe, which contained a thrombus, had not changed. Dr. Zaidi: Because additional thromboembolic events had occurred while the patient was receiving apixaban, this medication was discontinued. Treatment with therapeutic subcutaneous enoxa-parin sodium was initiated, after which the results of an antifactor Xa assay were reportedly within the therapeutic range. After 4 months of treatment, repeat imaging studies were obtained. Dr. McDermott: Two months before this presentation, CT angiography of the chest was performed at the other hospital. The right main pulmonary artery was completely occluded by thromboembolic material. There were several areas of consolidation that most likely represented evolving infarcts, as well as a thrombosed subsegmental artery in the left lower lobe in the area of the previously identified dilatation. Dr. Zaidi: Transthoracic echocardiography was performed. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 55, and the atria and right ventricle were of normal size and function. A ventilationperfu-sion scan revealed a complete absence of perfusion to the right lung and multiple wedge-shaped perfusion defects at the left lung base. The patient was referred to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital for further evaluation. On evaluation, the patient reported weight loss of 18 kg during the previous 3 months but no fever, night sweats, hemoptysis, oral ulcers, genital ulcers, rashes, or eye pain or redness. She had no known exposures to tuberculosis. She had a history of hypothyroidism and seizure disorder. Medications included subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium, levothyroxine, levetiracetam, and phe-nytoin. The patient reported consistent use of subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium, and the results of an antifactor Xa assay were reportedly in the therapeutic range. The patient resided in New England and had traveled to Florida during the year before this evaluation. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had diabetes; there was no family history of pulmonary disease, lung cancer, pulmonary embolism, or deep venous thrombosis. On physical examination, the temperature was 36.9C, the blood pressure 102/62 mm Hg in both arms, the pulse 96 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 48 kg, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 17.5. The patient was breathing comfortably. Both lungs were clear. The first and second heart sounds were normal, without murmurs. The radial and dorsalis pedis pulses were normal. There was no clubbing or edema. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Imaging studies were obtained to further evaluate the thrombus of the right main pulmonary artery. Dr. McDermott: Magnetic resonance imaging of the chest was performed before and after the administration of gadolinium. There was almost complete occlusion of the distal right main pulmonary artery and bilateral segmental and subartery, which was smooth and 2 mm in thickness (Fig. 2). The main pulmonary artery was not dilated, and there was no evidence of strain on the right side of the heart. A new aneurysm (2.4 cm in diameter) of the pulmonary artery in the lateral basal segment of the left lower lobe contained a small amount of eccentric thromboembolic material. There were enlarging pulmonary infarcts in the right lung with a small amount of adjacent loculated pleural fluid. Dr. Zaidi: The patient was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose, the complete blood count and differential count, and results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal. Assays for antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative, as were tests for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and type 2 antibodies and type 1 p24 antigen. Blood cultures showed no growth. Screening for antitreponemal antibodies and an interferon-γ release assay for tuberculosis were negative, as were the results of a blood test for galactomannan antigen (negative index value, <5.0). The 1,3-betad-glucan level was less than 31 pg per milliliter (reference range, <60), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 69 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), and the C-reactive protein level was 106 mg per liter (reference range, <8). Venous ultrasonography of both legs showed a partially occlusive deep venous thrombus (1.0 cm in length) in the right popliteal vein. A procedure was performed, and a diagnosis was made. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Hughes–Stovin syndrome. ", "prediction": "1. Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH): Given the patient's history of recurrent pulmonary emboli and progressive symptoms, CTEPH is a strong consideration.\n\n2. Pulmonary Artery Aneurysm (PAA): The presence of a new aneurysm in the pulmonary artery on imaging studies may indicate PAA potentially linked to her thromboembolic history.\n\n3. Protein S Deficiency: Although initial tests were negative for most thrombophilic markers, the reported low protein S level could predispose the patient to recurrent venous thrombosis.\n\n4. Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome (APLS): Despite negative initial tests, APLS is a possibility due to recurrent thromboembolic events; false negatives can occur.\n\n5. Vasculitis: Consideration should be given to undiagnosed systemic vasculitis such as Behcet's disease, especially with pulmonary artery involvement despite negative ANCA testing.\n\n6. Malignancy: A hidden malignancy could be causing a hypercoagulable state, leading to recurrent thromboembolic events.\n\n7. Congenital or Acquired Heart Disease: An underlying heart condition could potentially lead to pulmonary emboli and subsequent complications.\n\n8. Connective Tissue Disorders: Diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus, although seronegative ANAs, could still present with thrombotic events.\n\n9. Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT): Even without obvious thrombocytopenia, HIT can present with thrombosis despite anticoagulation.\n\n10. Infection-Related Embolism: Though tests for common infections were negative, an atypical infectious cause should not be completely ruled out, particularly considering her travel history."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Timothy W. Churchill: A 53-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of shock and recurrent ventricular tachycardia after defibrillator placement for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 4 weeks before this admission, when he was on vacation in the Caribbean and his wife noted that he was unresponsive, gurgling, and diaphoretic in the early morning. When he awoke, he reported chest pain, palpitations, and light-headedness. The patient was taken by ambulance to a local hospital, where the heart rate was 65 beats per minute, the blood pressure 100/56 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100 while he was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The troponin T level was 1.56 ng per milliliter normal range, 0.01, and the lactate level was 1.9 mmol per liter 17 mg per deciliter; normal range, 0.5 to 1.6 mmol per liter 5 to 14 mg per deciliter. A complete blood count and levels of electrolytes, magnesium, calcium, and amylase were normal, as were results of tests of renal and thyroid function; a d-dimer level was undetectable. While the patient was in the local hospital, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia developed at a heart rate of 201 beats per minute; electrocardioversion resulted in restoration of sinus rhythm. Aspirin, clopidogrel, enoxaparin, rosuvastatin, amiodarone, and tirofiban were administered. The patient was transferred by air to a hospital in Florida. On examination at the second hospital, the temperature was 36.8C, the heart rate 57 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/90 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood troponin I level was 116.00 ng per milliliter normal range, 0.05. A complete blood count, results of renal-function tests, levels of electrolytes and thyrotropin, and the prothrombin and partial-thrombo-plastin times were normal. An electrocardiogram Fig. 1A showed sinus bradycardia, a ventricular ectopic beat, first-degree atrioventricular delay, and delayed intraventricular conduction. Aspirin, amiodarone, enoxaparin, and atorvastatin were administered. Ventricular tachycardia recurred at a heart rate of 176 beats per minute. Despite the administration of an intravenous bolus of amiodarone, ventricular tachycardia persisted. Electrocardioversion restored sinus rhythm. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and cardiac studies were performed. Coronary angiography revealed no evidence of obstructive coronary disease. On ventriculogra-phy, the left ventricle was mildly and diffusely hypokinetic, and the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 22 mm Hg normal range, 8 to 15. Transthoracic echocardiography Fig. 1B revealed a dilated left ventricle with an end-diastolic dimension of 60 mm normal range, 42 to 58 and an ejection fraction of 35 normal range, 55 to 70; there was diffuse hypokinesis that was most notable in the inferior and septal territories, mildly increased wall thickness, and mild mitral regurgitation see Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Dr. Churchill: Additional laboratory test results included negative nucleic acid amplification tests of the blood for DNA of adenovirus, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, and My-coplasma pneumoniae, as well as negative nucleic acid amplification tests of a nasopharyngeal swab for DNA of Bordetella pertussis, coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus. In addition, serologic testing was negative for antibodies to coxsackievirus, human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, Lyme disease, and Trypano-soma cruzi, as well as for IgM antibodies to cyto-megalovirus, EpsteinBarr virus viral capsid antigen, and parvovirus. Aspirin, metoprolol succinate, and amiodarone were prescribed, and the patient was discharged with a wearable defibrillator vest after a follow-up visit had been scheduled at this hospital. Ten days before this admission, the patient had consultations at this hospital with a cardiologist specializing in the management of heart failure and an electrophysiologist. Vital signs were notable for a heart rate of 49 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 108/70 mm Hg; the examination was otherwise normal. An electrocardiogram Fig. 2A showed sinus bradycar-dia and first-degree atrioventricular delay, as well as right bundle-branch block and a left anterior fascicular block which together constitute bifas-cicular block. Aspirin was stopped, spironolac-tone was added, and placement of an implantable cardioverterdefibrillator ICD was scheduled. On the morning of this admission, during placement of a dual-chamber ICD, episodes of ventricular tachycardia with varying foci were induced. These episodes were terminated with overdrive pacing. After the procedure, ventricular tachycardia developed, with a heart rate of 108 beats per minute Fig. 2B. The blood pressure was 88/53 mm Hg, and a lidocaine infusion was administered. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. During the next 10 hours, multiple additional episodes of monomorphic ventricular rhythms occurred, with the heart rate ranging from 90 to 140 beats per minute. The rate of lidocaine infusion was increased, and amiodarone was administered. Early in the morning of the second hospital day, ventricular tachycardia recurred, with associated dyspnea and a blood pressure of 66/40 mm Hg. Normal saline and norepinephrine were administered intravenously. Chest radiography revealed ICD leads in the appropriate position, and bedside echocardiography revealed no evidence of peri-cardial effusion. The ventricular tachycardia was terminated with antitachycardic pacing, and the ICD was reprogrammed to provide atrial pacing at a rate of 110 beats per minute. The patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit ICU. A review of systems was notable for intermittent episodes of dyspnea. He had no dizziness, orthopnea, edema, or chest pain. He had a history of a kidney stone. Medications on admission to the cardiac ICU were metoprolol succi-nate, amiodarone, and spironolactone; he had no known allergies to medications. There was no family history of coronary artery disease, cardio-myopathy, heart failure, dysrhythmia, sudden death, or autoimmune disease. The patient was employed as a corporate executive. He had traveled extensively, including trips to urban areas in Mexico and Brazil during the previous 6 months. Three months before this admission, during a trip to Mexico, diarrhea had developed and spontaneously resolved after 2 weeks. He had two healthy adult children. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit substances. On examination in the cardiac ICU, the temperature was 36.8C, the heart rate 91 beats per minute, the blood pressure 102/56 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 94 while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared to be comfortable and was conversant. The jugular venous pulse was 8 cm of water. The site of ICD placement in the left deltopectoral groove was slightly tender. Auscultation revealed a soft apical systolic murmur and a third heart sound, as well as scattered crackles in the lungs. The arms and legs were warm and had no edema. He had no rashes or lymphadenopathy. The rest of the examination was normal. Results of blood tests of liver and thyroid function, tests for antinuclear antibodies, and serum protein electrophoresis were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed a wide QRS complex QRS duration, 240 msec at a heart rate of 100 beats per minute, with a rightward axis. A trans-thoracic echocardiogram Fig. 2C showed a dilated left ventricle with an end-diastolic dimension of 62 mm and an ejection fraction of 25; there was diffuse dysfunction that was most notable in the anterior, septal, and inferior territories, as well as some thinning of the basal interventricular septum to 7 mm. In addition, there was mild hypokinesis of the right ventricle, biatrial enlargement, moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation see Video 4, available at NEJM.org. During the second hospital day, ventricular tachycardia persisted despite the administration of lidocaine and amiodarone; an infusion of esmolol was begun. Diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Giant-cell myocarditis. ", "prediction": "1. Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: Given the diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy, with a dilated left ventricle and reduced ejection fraction, this is the primary underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.\n\n2.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. AbdulRasheed A. Alabi Medicine: A 68-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital during the winter because of a rash, hyponatremia, and anterior uveitis. One month before admission, the patient traveled abroad. She spent a week in Sweden visiting family members, including her young grandchildren, and then she traveled to India 25 days before admission. She was well until 14 days before admission, when malaise and a nonpainful, nonpruritic, erythematous, maculopapu-lar rash developed. The rash first appeared on the thighs; by the following day, it had become diffuse, involving the legs and feet including the soles, arms and hands including the palms, abdomen, chest, and flanks. On the fifth day of illness, the patient was seen by a physician in India. A complete blood count was reportedly normal. An unspecified medication was administered intramuscularly, and fexofenadine, ranitidine, a 9-day tapering course of prednisone, and a 5-day course of erythromycin were prescribed. During the next 10 days, malaise persisted, the rash did not improve, and a mild, dry cough developed. The patient also noted mild blurred vision, which was worse in the left eye than in the right eye and was accompanied by mild photo-phobia and floaters with a spiderweb appearance. One or two episodes of diarrhea occurred each day, and she took loperamide. Two days before admission, the patient returned to Sweden to visit family members. While she was there, arthralgias of the knees developed and the left eye became red. The patient then took a flight back to the United States, which landed on the day of admission; when she arrived, she presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported fatigue, decreased appetite, diffuse myalgias, and mild, generalized swelling that was most prominent around the ankles. She had not noted fever or headache. She had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, anxiety, depression, cataracts, and osteopenia, and she had under-gone tonsillectomy during childhood, myomec-tomy and ovarian cystectomy 32 years before this admission, and allograft reconstruction of an injured right anterior cruciate ligament 11 years before this admission. The patient was taking lisinopril and had no known allergies to medications; amitriptyline had caused paresthesias, and she had had anxiety while she was taking oxycodone and acetaminophen in combination. Immunizations were reportedly current; in preparation for her trip to India, she had received an unspecified hepatitis vaccine. The patient was married, lived with her husband in a suburban area of New England, and was retired. She had traveled extensively, including trips to northern and eastern Europe, Africa, and Central America. During her recent trip, she visited a national park in central India, where she received multiple mosquito bites. She observed a variety of wild animals but did not have contact with them. While she was in the park, approximately 23 days before admission, she found an engorged tick on her right leg. She reported that she does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs and had stopped smoking tobacco 34 years earlier, with a history of 14 pack-years. There was a family history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and stroke. On examination, the patient had a labile affect; she appeared to be confused intermittently and made nonsensical statements occasionally. The temperature was 36.2C, the pulse 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 163/89 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while she was breathing ambient air. Mild photophobia was present, and there were flat patches of subconjunctival hemorrhage in the left eye and petechiae on the hard palate. She coughed with deep breathing, but the lungs were clear on auscultation. There was trace edema of the feet but no erythema, swelling, pain with movement, or warmth of the knees. There was a diffuse erythematous rash, which was macular and nonblanching on the lower legs and on the palms and soles Fig. 1 and was maculopapular and blanching, without coalescence, on the thighs, abdomen, chest, and arms. The remainder of the general examination was normal. The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, red-cell indexes, platelet count, anion gap, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate amino-transferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, lactic acid, and thyrotropin; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed clear, yellow urine, with 2 ketones, 2 leukocyte esterase, a specific gravity of 1.015, and a pH of 5.0; on microscopic examination, there were 0 to 2 red cells per high-power field, 20 to 50 white cells per high-power field, and 1 bacteria. An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm, with sinus arrhythmia, poor R-wave progression, and minor, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs were normal. Normal saline was administered. The patient was seen by an ophthalmologist. The visual acuity was 2025 with eyeglasses. In the left eye, there was trace injection of the conjunctivas, with flat patches of subconjunctival hemorrhage inferiorly, temporally, and nasally. Slit-lamp examination revealed fine keratic precipitates on the left inferior cornea, with a single white cell in the right anterior chamber, 3 white cells per high-power field in the left anterior chamber, and 2 nuclear sclerosis in both lenses. Indirect ophthalmos-copy revealed trace vitreous debris in both eyes. The remainder of the ophthalmologic examination was normal. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Ophthalmic prednisolone and cyclopentolate 1 solutions were administered in the left eye. Diagnostic tests were performed.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Molly E. Wolf Medicine: A 40-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of progressive edema of the legs, as well as abdominal distention and pain. The patient had been in good health until approximately 10 months before this evaluation, when episodes of pain and swelling developed in the feet and ankles. Initially, the episodes occurred during the evening, after prolonged standing during the day. During subsequent months, the episodes became more frequent and began to occur earlier in the day. The swelling progressed to involve the lower legs and thighs. The patient was evaluated by her primary care physician, and compression stockings were recommended. Five months before this evaluation, pain developed in the back and flank on the left side, and the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital. A provisional diagnosis of musculoskeletal pain was made, and benzodiazepines and muscle relaxants were prescribed. Despite the administration of these medications, the back and flank pain persisted, and the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of a second hospital. The weight was 82 kg. The platelet count, results of kidney-function tests, and blood levels of hemoglobin, electrolytes, and glucose were normal. Tests were negative for hepatitis C virus antibody and for hepatitis B virus surface antigen and surface antibody. The blood albumin level was 1.9 g per deciliter reference range, 4.0 to 5.0, and the white-cell count was 12,500 per cubic millimeter reference range, 4500 to 11,000, with a normal differential count. The d-dimer level was more than 20 g per milliliter reference range, 0.27 to 20. An imaging study of the chest was scheduled, and nitrofurantoin was prescribed for a suspected urinary tract infection. Dr. Midhir J. Patel: The next day, computed tomographic CT angiography of the chest revealed findings consistent with a calcified granuloma measuring 3 mm in diameter in the right upper lobe and multiple pulmonary emboli involving the main, lobar, segmental, and subsegmental pulmonary arteries bilaterally. Dr. Wolf: Anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin was administered, and the patient was admitted to the second hospital. Over a period of 3 days, the anticoagulation regimen was transitioned to apixaban, and the back and flank pain diminished. The patient was discharged home with prescriptions for apixaban and nitrofurantoin. The pulmonary emboli were considered to be unprovoked, and evaluation by a hematologist was recommended. While the patient was receiving anticoagulation, she had persistent leg swelling, but the back and flank pain did not recur. Evaluation by a hematologist did not reveal an underlying cause of the pulmonary embolism, and anticoagulation of indefinite duration was advised. Four weeks before this evaluation, the swelling of the legs worsened and abdominal distention developed. Intermittent swelling of the hands occurred, as did swelling around the eyes in the morning upon awakening. The patient had a consultation with a vascular specialist, but no primary venous disease of the legs was identified. The abdominal distention worsened, and 1 week before this evaluation, diffuse, crampy abdominal pain with nausea developed. The abdominal pain waxed and waned for several days but worsened on the day of this evaluation. The patient also had dyspnea, and she presented to the emergency department of the second hospital, where additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Patel: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nonocclu-sive thrombus in the right renal vein. Wall thickening of the gastric antrum and proximal small bowel, multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, mild mesenteric edema, and evidence of small-volume ascites were also noted Fig. 1. Dr. Wolf: On the basis of the results of these imaging studies, the patient sought evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital. She reported ongoing abdominal pain, nausea, and loose stools. She noted an unintentional weight gain of 10 kg since the leg swelling had begun 10 months previously, despite no change in ap-petite or food intake. She also reported increases in urinary frequency and sensation of thirst. She had no chest pain, hematuria, hemoptysis, dark stools, night sweats, fatigue, joint symptoms, or eye or ear symptoms. The patient, who was black, had a medical history that was notable for hypothyroidism, latent tuberculosis with a previous negative chest radiograph, two spontaneous vaginal deliveries, and ectopic pregnancy. She had undergone an ovary-sparing abdominal hysterectomy for fibroid uterus and an appendectomy. Medications included levothyroxine and apixaban. There had been no adverse reactions to medications. She did not use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. The patient had grown up on a Caribbean island and had immigrated to the United States when she was 19 years of age. She worked as an assistant in a health care facility and lived with her husband and two healthy children. There was no history of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit-drug use. There was no family history of renal, thrombo-embolic, or autoimmune disease. On examination, the temperature was 36.8C, the pulse 76 beats per minute, the blood pressure 131/70 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 88.5 kg, the height 173 cm, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 29.7. There was 2 edema of the lower and upper legs. The jugular venous pressure was 8 cm of water. There was no periorbital or hand edema. The abdomen was distended and mildly, diffusely tender, with well-healed surgical scars. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of globulin, phosphorus, magnesium, lipase, lactic acid, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase were normal, as were the pro-thrombin time and partial-thromboplastin time. Urinalysis was negative for glucose, bilirubin, ketones, nitrite, and leukocyte esterase. Tests were negative for antidouble-stranded DNA, rheumatoid factor antibody, human immunodeficiency virus HIV antibody, antitreponemal antibody, and hepatitis C virus antibody, as well as for hepatitis B virus surface antibody, surface antigen, and core antibody. The serum protein electrophoresis pattern was normal, except for a diffuse decrease in gamma globulin. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram was normal, and ultrasonography of the kidneys revealed normal kidney size and echotexture. Diagnostic tests were performed.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Sally A. Ingham Medicine: A 45-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and confusion. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 18 months before the current admission, when the blood pressure was noted to be 140/90 mm Hg during a routine appointment with her primary care physician. Therapy with oral contraceptive pills was discontinued, but the blood pressure was persistently elevated when it was measured at home and during subsequent clinical evaluations. Results of duplex ultrasonography of the bilateral renal arterial vasculature were normal, as were levels of thyrotropin, plasma free catecholamines, plasma metanephrines, and aldosterone. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal ventricular function, with no evidence of valvular disease or left ventricular hypertrophy; the inter-ventricular septal wall thickness was 11 mm normal range, 7 to 11. Lisinopril was administered, and the blood pressure decreased to 120/80 mm Hg. Four weeks before the current admission, swelling of the legs, abdominal distention, intermittent dyspnea on exertion, and fatigue developed, and the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. She reported a weight gain of 4.5 kg during the previous month, occasional episodes of confusion, and two episodes of burning chest pain during exercise that had lasted for 2 minutes each and were relieved with rest. On examination, the temperature was 36.8C, the blood pressure 1801/10 mm Hg, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 66.9 kg; approximately 5 months earlier, at a clinic visit, it had been 67.1 kg. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 22. A systolic murmur grade 26 was best heard at the left sternal border. The jugular venous pressure was estimated to be 10 cm of water. The abdomen was soft, nontender, and slightly distended. There was trace nonpitting edema in the legs. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm and left-axis deviation. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph showed a normal cardiac silhouette and small bilateral pleural effusions, with no opacities or pulmonary edema. The patient was admitted to this hospital. The patient had a history of endometriosis and dysmenorrhea, conditions that had been treated with a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system. She had a remote history of palpitations that were not associated with evidence of arrhythmia on Holter monitoring. The only medication was lisinopril. The patients mother and sister had both had venous thromboses and miscarriages. Her maternal uncle had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; there was no family history of sudden cardiac death. The patient did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. She was married and worked as a lawyer. Furosemide was administered intravenously, and the patient reported a decrease in the dys-pnea and swelling. Daily therapy with a low dose of oral furosemide was initiated. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function, with an ejection fraction of 76 normal range, 50 to 75, as well as biventricular hypertrophy, an interventricular sep-tal wall thickness of 14 mm, mild mitral regurgitation, systolic anterior motion of the mitral-valve leaflets, and accelerated flow in the left ventricular outflow tract. Because the blood pressure was persistently elevated, the dose of lisino-pril was increased and treatment with metopro-lol and nifedipine was initiated. On the third hospital day, the patient was discharged home. Three weeks before the current admission, dyspnea on exertion and fatigue recurred, and the patient was again evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. She reported a 3-day history of malaise and night sweats. On examination, the temperature was 36.8C, the blood pressure 148/96 mm Hg, the heart rate 84 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 65.3 kg. Jugular venous pulsation was not visible, and there was no leg edema; otherwise, the results of the physical examination had not changed from the previous week. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood and urine cultures were sterile. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus HIV type 1 p24 antigen and HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies were negative. An interferon- release assay for tuberculosis was nonreactive. A chest radiograph showed that the pleural effusions had resolved and that no opacities or pulmonary edema had developed. The patient was admitted to this hospital, and additional cardiac imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Michael T. Lu: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the chest, performed before and after the administration of gadolinium, revealed asymmetric left ventricular septal hypertrophy maximal wall thickness, 21 mm and mild left ventricular enlargement with hyperdynamic systolic function ejection fraction, 71. There was no evidence of myocardial iron overload, and there were small areas of late gadolinium enhancement in the midwall. These findings were compatible with fibrosis due to hypertrophic cardio-myopathy Fig. 1A and 1B. Dr. Ingham: The patients prescribed dose of oral furosemide was administered, but orthostatic hypotension developed. She received intravenous fluids, and furosemide therapy was discontinued. She did not have a fever during the hospitalization. The white-cell count decreased but did not normalize. On the sixth hospital day, the patient was discharged home. The weight was 62.1 kg. At home, the fatigue continued to decrease until 2 weeks after discharge, when recurrent fatigue, fevers, and palpitations developed. The patient was again evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. The patients husband reported that she had become increasingly confused, irritable, and anxious. He also noted that she appeared to be weak globally, with increased respiratory effort on exertion. The patient reported frequent urination and increased thirst. On examination, the temperature was 36.2C, the blood pressure 135/80 mm Hg, the heart rate 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 60.0 kg. The patient was awake, alert, and cooperative, but she was unable to state the year or to count backward from 100 in increments of 7.  She occasionally responded to questions inappropriately and with confabulation. Cranial-nerve function was normal, although the first cranial nerve was not tested. Strength was 45 in the proximal muscles of the arms and legs. Sensation was normal. A systolic murmur grade 36 was best heard at the left sternal border. Jugular venous pulsation was not visible, and there was no leg edema. The amount of scalp hair had decreased, and hair growth on the upper lip and chin had increased. She had no rashes, bruises, striae, or hyperpigmentation. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Lu: Computed tomographic CT angiography of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the right lower lobe, with no evidence of strain on the right side of the heart or of pulmonary infarction. There was diffuse thickening of both adrenal glands (Figure 1C and 1D). MRI, angiography, and venography of the head revealed no evidence of a mass, acute infarction, arterial abnormalities, or venous sinus thrombosis. Dr. Ingham: The patient was admitted to this hospital. A continuous infusion of heparin was administered intravenously, and her prescribed medications were continued. Despite having a normal diet, the patient had persistent hypokalemia and received aggressive potassium supplementation. A diagnostic test was performed. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Cushing’s syndrome due to ectopic corticotropin secretion. ", "prediction": "1. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM): Given the presence of asymmetrical septal hypertrophy, hyperdynamic systolic function, and family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, HCM is a strong consideration.\n2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The CT angiography revealing segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the right lower lobe supports a diagnosis of PE, which can cause dyspnea and fatigue.\n3. Cushing's Syndrome: The patient's weight gain, increased thirst, frequent urination, irritability, confusion, and physical features such as scalp hair loss and upper lip/chin hair growth suggest possible hypercortisolism.\n4. Hyperaldosteronism: Persistent hypokalemia despite aggressive supplementation could indicate primary hyperaldosteronism, especially given the adrenal gland thickening noted on imaging.\n5. Chronic Heart Failure: Symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, leg edema, and jugular venous distension alongside pleural effusions and echocardiographic findings can be indicative of heart failure.\n6. Pheochromocytoma: Given the refractory hypertension, occasional chest pain, and confusion, a pheochromocytoma remains a consideration, although initial plasma metanephrine levels were normal.\n7. Renal Artery Stenosis: Hypertension resistant to multiple medications may suggest renal artery stenosis as a potential cause.\n8. Adrenal Hyperplasia: The findings of diffuse adrenal gland thickening might indicate bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, contributing to hormonal imbalances and electrolyte disturbances.\n9. Infectious Endocarditis: Although the patient does not present fever, the systolic murmur (best heard at the left sternal border) coupled with the episodic confusion and previous endocarditis history heightens this risk.\n10. Addison's Disease: Chronic fatigue, weight loss, and orthostatic hypotension (alongside diffuse adrenal thickening) may point toward adrenal insufficiency due to Addison's disease."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Jaime L. Schneider Medicine: A 64-year-old man was admitted to this hospital with a 2-week history of fever, chills, arthralgias, abdominal and testicular pain, and leukocytosis. Twenty-five years before the current admission, while the patient was living in China, he received a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. At that time, he completed a 14-month course of a four-drug regimen for tuberculosis with unknown medications. Although the treatment was completed, a chronic cough that produced scant white sputum persisted. Two years later, the patient immigrated to the United States, and examination of an induced sputum sample for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was reportedly negative. The patient also had a history of hepatitis B virus HBV infection; 12 years before the current admission, he had a positive test for HBV surface antigen. At that time, a nucleic acid amplification test for HBV DNA was negative. Thereafter, annual surveillance for cancer was performed with abdominal ultrasonography and measurement of the blood alpha-fetoprotein level. An elevated alpha-fetopro-tein level was never detected. Ultrasonography was notable for the presence of simple hepatic and renal cysts and heterogeneous hepatic echotexture, but followup examination with magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the liver revealed no signal abnormality. Three years before the current admission, the patient was evaluated for chronic cough. Radiography of the chest revealed a nodular opacity at the apex of the right lung. Follow-up examination with computed tomography CT of the chest revealed a calcified granuloma at the right apex and evidence of bronchiectasis, and plans were made for annual surveillance with CT. Fourteen days before the current admission, anorexia and fatigue developed, along with pain and tightness in the back and calves. Six days later, the patient was seen by his primary care physician at this hospital. He reported no antecedent trauma. The temperature was 37.0C. There was tenderness in the bilateral lumbar paraspinal muscles. Results of a neurologic examination  including tests of mo-tor strength, sensation, reflexes, coordination, and gait  were normal. Radiography of the lumbar spine revealed multilevel degenerative disk disease that was most pronounced at the L4 to L5 level, with preserved vertebral-body height. Ibuprofen was prescribed. Later that day, the temperature reached 38.9C. Fever, chills, sweats, and rigors persisted and were associated with myalgias of the back and calves that were severe enough to impair walking. Ibuprofen provided only temporary relief of the fever and myalgias. The patient visited a traditional Chinese doctor, who performed mox-ibustion i.e., the application of burning dried mugwort directly to the body and administered a cathartic agent, which had no effect. Left testicular pain and swelling developed, and the patient returned to his primary care physician 5 days after the previous visit. He reported no dysuria, hematuria, lymphadenopathy, headache, nuchal rigidity, or rash. The examination was notable for a temperature of 37.8C shortly after the administration of ibuprofen, the presence of moxi-bustion marks on the upper back, and a swollen, tender area on the upper lateral aspect of the left testicle. Screening tests for Lyme disease and nucleic acid amplification tests for babesia, ehrlichia, and anaplasma DNA were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood and urine cultures and imaging studies were performed. Dr. Aoife Kilcoyne: On ultrasonography of the scrotum, both testes had normal echotexture and normal Doppler flow, with no focal lesions. Bilateral subcentimeter epididymal cysts were identified. Radiography of the chest revealed a nodular opacity at the apex of the right lung, which had not changed from previous studies and was most likely related to previous granulo-matous disease. There were new ill-defined opacities at the lung bases that, in the appropriate clinical context, could reflect multifocal pneumonia. Dr. Schneider: A 7-day course of levofloxacin was prescribed. Fever recurred with a temperature of up to 39.0C and was associated with chills, rigors, anorexia, myalgias, and arthralgias. These symptoms persisted for the next 3 days, and the myalgias and arthralgias appeared to worsen when the temperature was highest. The patient also had intermittent sharp abdominal pain, two episodes of nonbloody diarrhea, and a weight loss of 1 kg. His primary care physician referred him to the emergency department of this hospital. Additional patient history was obtained in the emergency department. The patient reported brief, sharp, stabbing chest pain that was not related to exertion, as well as a chronic cough that produced thin, white sputum. He also noted that blurry vision had developed in the left eye 2 days earlier, with no vision loss. He had pruritus and tinea cruris. A review of systems was negative for headache, jaw claudication, other rashes, and joint pain. No sick contacts were reported. Medications included levofloxacin, aspirin, nystatin powder, and triamcinolone cream. The use of tamsulosin had caused nasal discharge. The patient had smoked a half pack of cigarettes per day for more than 40 years, but he did not use illicit drugs. He drank one glass of wine per night, although he had previously consumed up to two drinks of whiskey daily. The patient had retired from restaurant work 2 years earlier, and his last international trip had been to China 3 years earlier. His father died from lung cancer at 71 years of age, and his mother died at 39 years of age from an unknown cause. The patient had six siblings, a son who had a hemangioma, and a daughter who had an irregular heartbeat. There was no family history of pulmonary, ocular, infectious, or rheumatologic diseases. On examination, the temperature was 37.8C and then rose to 38.3C, the blood pressure 126/64 mm Hg, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert, and he appeared somewhat fatigued. The eyes had no scleral icterus, and the oropharynx had no erythema, exudates, or ulcerations. The neck was supple, with a normal range of motion, and the spine and paraspinal muscles were non-tender. There was no cervical or axillary lymph-adenopathy. Auscultation revealed faint rales at the lung bases and scattered bilateral rhonchi and wheezes, with no cardiac murmur or rub. The bowel sounds were normal, and the abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, with no rebound, guarding, or hepatosplenomegaly. There was no rash, joint deformity, erythema, warmth, swelling, effusion, or tenderness. The joints had full range of motion. The stool was guaiac-negative. Motor strength was normal and symmetric in the arms and legs, and distal pulses were intact. The levels of troponin T, creatine kinase, lipase, lactate dehydrogenase, prostate-specific antigen, and thyrotropin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of urine and blood were performed. A respiratory viral panel was negative for adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and metapneu-movirus. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with premature atrial beats and was otherwise normal. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Kilcoyne: Radiography of the chest revealed persistent opacities at the lung bases and right apex. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed mildly increased enhancement of the gallbladder wall, as well as pericholecystic fluid. These findings are nonspecific; in the absence of gallstones, they could occur in the context of volume overload or as manifestations of a systemic condition, such as chronic liver disease. Scattered subcentimeter hypodensities were present in the liver that most likely represented simple cysts. Bilateral small pleural effusions and trace peritoneal fluid were present. Ultraso-nography of the right upper quadrant revealed thickening of the gallbladder wall, along with gallbladder sludge. Sonographic Murphys sign was negative. Dr. Schneider: The patient was admitted to the hospital. Levofloxacin was discontinued, and acetaminophen and one dose of doxycycline were administered. Over the next 6 days, the patient remained febrile, with a temperature ranging from 38.1 to 39.6C. Additional tests were performed Table 2. Hepatobiliary radionuclide scanning revealed patent cystic and common bile ducts, with no evidence of acute cholecystitis. Ophthalmologic evaluation revealed only mild cataracts and dry eyes, with no evidence of an eye infection or retinopathy. Dr. Kilcoyne: Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, performed on the fifth hospital day, revealed bilateral pleural effusions that were larger than they had been on the day of admission. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine revealed no evidence of diskitis, osteomyelitis, or epidural abscesses. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the liver revealed scattered sub-centimeter simple hepatic cysts. Thoracentesis was performed on the right side with the use of ultrasonographic guidance. Dr. Schneider: The pleural fluid was consistent with a transudative effusion. A test of the pleural fluid for adenosine deaminase was negative, as was a Grams stain and an acid-fast smear; cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi were performed. Cytologic examination of the urine, which was performed because of the history of smoking and microscopic hematuria, revealed no malignant cells. Transthoracic echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography revealed no valvular vegetation. On the seventh hospital day, swelling, pain, and tenderness recurred in the left scrotum. The temperature reached 40.1C. Urinalysis revealed 2 blood and 10 to 20 red cells per high-power field. Dr. Kilcoyne: Follow-up ultrasonography of the scrotum Fig. 1, performed 10 days after the first ultrasound study had been obtained, revealed new engorgement of testicular vessels that was greater on the left side than on the right side. Both testes were heterogeneous in echotexture. The findings were suggestive of epididymo-orchitis. Dr. Schneider: Ceftriaxone was administered, and additional diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Polyarteritis nodosa. ", "prediction": "1. Infective Endocarditis: Given the patient's persistent fever, chills, leukocytosis, and history of intravenous drug use, infective endocarditis should be considered, although no valvular vegetations were detected on echocardiography.\n\n2.

The patient had a history of alcohol-use disorder; he had started drinking heavily in his 20s. Sixteen years before this presentation, he was involved in a high-speed motor vehicle accident. He was admitted to this hospital because of multiple traumatic rib fractures with pneumothoraxes. An evaluation was notable for a serum ethanol level of 2659 mg per liter reference range, 1000, a creatine kinase level of 670 U per liter reference range, 60 to 400, and an aspartate aminotransferase level of 95 U per liter reference range, 10 to 40; a comprehensive urine and serum toxicology screen was otherwise negative. Bilateral chest tubes were placed for the pneumothoraxes. The patient was evaluated by psychiatry and addiction consultants, but longitudinal follow-up was not maintained. Eight years before this presentation, the patient was evaluated for an episode of severe depression; an unspecified antidepressant medication was prescribed, but he declined to follow up with psychiatry. Four years before this presentation, during a period in which he reportedly felt impulsive, he was arrested three times within 2 weeks for driving under the influence of alcohol; he was sentenced to jail and was forced to surrender his drivers license. Thereafter, he abstained from drinking alcohol and participated in an intensive outpatient program and Alcoholics Anonymous. He was referred to a psychiatrist for persistent severe depression, but he declined to attend the appointments. His primary care physician initiated several trials of antidepressants, including selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, but the treatments had no clear benefit. One year before this presentation, the patient was admitted to a second hospital after he had a fall in the context of acute weakness and numbness of an arm and leg. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head reportedly revealed evidence of remote infarcts of the right frontal and left parietal lobes, as well as diffuse white-matter disease. Aspirin, atorvastatin, and duloxetine were prescribed. On discharge, there were no residual neurologic deficits. Three months before this presentation, after 3.5 years of sobriety, the patient began to drink 1 pint of vodka per day. A few days after resuming alcohol intake, the patient noted dyspnea and presented to the second hospital, where atrial flutter was detected. Transesophageal echocar-diography revealed moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, a patent foramen ovale, and no evidence of thrombus in the left atrial appendage. Direct-current cardioversion was performed, resulting in sinus rhythm. Aspirin and duloxetine were discontinued, and therapy with apixaban, torsemide, lisinopril, and metoprolol tartrate was initiated. The next month, during a period in which the patient reportedly felt reckless and out of control, he borrowed his wifes car and drove for the first time since surrendering his license. He lost control of the car and crashed into a barn, sustaining spinal fractures that necessitated the use of a cane. During the same period, the patient was also noted to spend impulsively, to need less sleep, and to be increasingly physically and verbally abusive toward family members. He was seen by his primary care physician, who thought that his affect was manic, representing a marked change from his baseline of depression. One month before this presentation, the patient reportedly had increased energy, irritability, a euphoric mood, and a decreased need to sleep. He was spending impulsively, including 25,000 on home renovations that were viewed to be unnecessary by his family. The patient increased his consumption to more than 1 pint of vodka daily. He was evaluated by a psychiatrist at another institution, and a diagnosis of bipolar disorder was considered. Lurasidone was prescribed, but the patient took it for only 10 days. Three days before this presentation, the patient traveled to Boston by bus and taxi from his home state. He checked into several hotels, gambled, shopped extravagantly, and invited strangers for a steak dinner. He ran out of money and contacted friends and family in Boston, including his son, for money. Although the patient threatened to assault his son, his son brought him to the emergency department at this hospital. On presentation, history was obtained from the patient, as well as his wife and son. The patient reported having a high energy level and racing thoughts and needing to sleep only 3 hours per night. He had no weakness, numbness, vision changes, headache, dysarthria, dysphagia, or hallucinations. He reported no fever, abdominal pain, chest pain, palpitations, or dyspnea. He had not had a previous psychiatric hospitalization. The medical history was notable for stroke, atrial dysrhythmia, hypertension, dyslipid-emia, and remote migraines. Medications on presentation were apixaban, atorvastatin, torse-mide, lisinopril, and metoprolol tartrate. There was no history of adverse reactions to medications. The patients father had had one psychiatric hospitalization for an unclear diagnosis and had died of stomach cancer; the patients brother had schizophrenia, and his mother had died of heart failure. There was no family history of substance-use disorder, stroke, or suicide. The patient reported no illicit-drug use and had smoked 1 to 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 40 years. He had been born and raised in the Boston area and had completed community college before working as a sales manager. He lived with his wife in New England and had two adult children living near Boston. On examination, the temperature was 36.4C, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, the blood pressure 175/90 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was described as agitated and belligerent, with some pressured and rapid but interruptible speech. He had a ruddy complexion and mild, symmetric pitting edema of the legs. The results of a comprehensive neurologic examination were normal, except for the presence of mild dysmet-ria on bilateral fingernosefinger tests and a low-amplitude action tremor. A mental status examination was notable for impaired short-term recall and tangential answers to questions. The patient was described as having an expansive mood, with some emotional lability, including intermittent tearfulness. Results of urinalysis, chest radiography, and liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, total protein, and lipase. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Transthoracic echocardiog-raphy revealed left ventricular dilatation and dysfunction ejection fraction, 38, right ven-tricular hypokinesis, biatrial dilatation, a patent foramen ovale with an interatrial septal aneurysm, aortic-valve sclerosis, and mild mitral regurgitation. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and a diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Poststroke mania and the frontal lobe syndrome. ", "prediction": "1. Bipolar Disorder, Type I: The patient's symptoms of grandiosity, impulsivity, decreased sleep, euphoric mood, and episodes of severe depression are suggestive of a manic episode in the context of Bipolar Disorder.\n2. Alcohol-induced Mood Disorder: The patient's significant alcohol use, history of heavy drinking, and recent relapse may contribute to mood dysregulation and mimic symptoms of Bipolar Disorder.\n3. Frontal Lobe Syndrome: The patient's history of infarcts in the right frontal lobe could account for changes in behavior, impulsivity, and emotional regulation due to frontal lobe dysfunction.\n4. Substance Use Disorder: Given his high level of alcohol consumption and prior history of alcohol use disorder, ongoing substance use could be driving his current symptoms and behavior.\n5. Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features: The patient's history of severe depression and the presence of grandiosity and impulsive behavior might suggest a severe depressive episode with psychotic features.\n6. Antisocial Personality Disorder: The patient's history of impulsivity, arrests for DUI, and increased potentially reckless behaviors may suggest underlying antisocial personality traits.\n7. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): The patient’s history of a serious motor vehicle accident and subsequent trauma might contribute to ongoing psychological symptoms, such as impulsivity and mood disturbances.\n8. Borderline Personality Disorder: The patient's mood instability, impulsive actions, and interpersonal issues, including verbal and physical abusiveness, could indicate an underlying borderline personality disorder.\n9. Dementia: The patient's impaired short-term recall, tangential speech, and changes in behavior may point towards early-onset dementia, particularly given his history of cerebrovascular disease.\n10. Thyrotoxicosis: Symptoms like increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and agitation could be consistent with thyrotoxicosis, although normal lab results make it less likely.\n\n"}

Wolf Medicine: A 64-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of progressive leg weakness, recurrent falls, and anemia. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 months before this admission, when fatigue on exertion and subjective leg weakness developed. During the next 3 months, the distance he was able to walk became progressively shorter, because he frequently needed to stop and rest owing to fatigue and leg weakness; he had previously been able to walk long distances. Five months before this admission, intermittent hypoesthesias and paresthesias developed in the feet. Four months before this admission, two lower teeth became loose and fell out, with no preceding trauma. Four months before this admission, the patient fell in his garage and attributed the fall to tripping over an object on the ground. He did not hit his head, lose consciousness, or need assistance to stand or walk after the fall. He was evaluated by his primary care provider. On evaluation, he reported 3 months of increased alcohol consumption up to 6 or 7 glasses of wine each night and several months of voluntarily restricted food intake to achieve weight loss. On physical examination, the vital signs were normal. The height was 166.6 cm, and the weight was 128.4 kg 6 months earlier, the weight had been 140.6 kg; the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 46. Ecchymoses were present on the knees. Two lower front teeth were absent, and there were areas of gingival bleeding; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. The patient was counseled on unhealthy alcohol use, but he declined a referral to an outpatient alcohol-cessation program. During the next 4 months, fatigue and leg weakness gradually progressed, and the patient needed to use his arms to rise from a seated position. He had three additional falls, which he described as his legs giving out while he was walking. Two days before admission, the patient fell while he was carrying a bag of groceries and struck the left side of his face on the ground. With each fall, there was no loss of consciousness or associated light-headedness, dizziness, chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, nausea, or incontinence. The patient rented a wheelchair to avoid walking long distances and presented to his primary care clinic at this hospital for evaluation. On evaluation in the clinic, the patient reported mild pain above the left eye but no headache, neck pain, back pain, urinary retention, fecal incontinence, fever, chills, morning stiffness, muscle pain, muscle swelling, dark stools, melena, or hematemesis. He had a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, gout, osteoarthritis of the knees, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and Barretts esophagus, which had been diagnosed by means of biopsy 7 years before this admission. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass had been performed 6 years before this admission. Medications were allopurinol, amlodipine, furosemide, indomethacin, losartan, metoprolol, omeprazole, rivaroxaban, bupropion, cyanocobalamin, ergo-calciferol, and a thiamine supplement. The patient was divorced, lived alone, and worked as a store manager. He did not smoke tobacco. His father and brother had both died of esophageal cancer. On evaluation in the clinic, the temperature was 36.3C, the blood pressure 139/81 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 124.3 kg. Purple ecchy-moses were present on the left side of the face and left flank, and brown ecchymoses were present around the right eye. Two lower front teeth were absent Fig. 1A. The first and second heart sounds were normal, without murmurs. The breath sounds were normal bilaterally, without wheezing or rhonchi. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft, nondistended, and nontender on palpation. The edge of the liver was not palpable, and the spleen was not enlarged. Motor strength was 3 out of 5 bilaterally on hip flexion and 4 out of 5 bilaterally on hip extension; the patient could not rise from a seated position, even when he used his arms for assistance. The remainder of the motor examination was normal. There was no muscle atrophy, swelling, or tenderness on palpation. Perception of pinprick was diminished in the legs from the toes to above the knees. Perception of light touch was diminished on the plantar surface of the feet. Proprioception was decreased in the big toes. Reflexes were normal, as were the results of fingernosefinger testing. An evaluation for the Babinski sign and a Romberg test were not performed. Hair was thin and fragile on the arms and absent on the legs. The stool was brown and negative for occult blood. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The patient was referred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, laboratory evaluation revealed normal blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, troponin T, creatine kinase, vitamin B12, 1,25-dihy-droxyvitamin D, thyrotropin, and glycated hemoglobin. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.009 reference range, 1.001 to 1.035, a pH of 5 reference range, 5 to 9, and ketones, with no protein, glucose, bilirubin, or blood. Blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus HIV type 1 p24 antigen and HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Computed tomography of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed soft-tissue swelling on the left anterior side of the face, with no evidence of fracture, intracranial hemorrhage, infarction, hydrocephalus, or mass lesion. A chest radiograph showed degenerative changes of the bony thorax, with no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and a high-dose thiamine infusion, a folate supplement, and a multivitamin were administered, in addition to his usual medications. One hour after admission, the blood pressure was 89/47 mm Hg and the heart rate was 90 beats per minute while the patient was sitting; after he stood up, the blood pressure was 75/40 mm Hg and the heart rate was 100 beats per minute. Amlodipine, furo-semide, losartan, and metoprolol were discontinued, and fluids were administered intravenously. Two days later, the blood pressure was 12472 and the heart rate was 91 beats per minute while the patient was sitting; after he stood up, the blood pressure was 80/50 mm Hg and the heart rate was 89 beats per minute. He could rise from a seated position with minimal use of his arms. An area of bruising 10 cm in diameter developed on the right forearm, where a peripheral intravenous catheter had been placed Fig. 1B. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy). Vitamin B6, folate, zinc, and selenium deficiencies. Alcohol-use disorder. ", "prediction": "1. **Scurvy (Vitamin C deficiency)**: Symptoms such as ecchymoses, loose teeth, gingival bleeding, thin and fragile hair, and a history of low food intake are consistent with vitamin C deficiency.\n2. **Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome**: His increased alcohol intake and symptoms that include leg weakness and recurrent falls point to a potential thiamine deficiency leading to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.\n3. **Peripheral neuropathy**: The patient's hypoesthesias and paresthesias in the feet, as well as diminished pinprick and light touch perception, are indicative of peripheral neuropathy, possibly secondary to alcohol use or nutrient deficiencies.\n4. **Iron-deficiency anemia**: Progressive leg weakness and his anemia are consistent with iron-deficiency anemia, possibly exacerbated by poor nutritional intake.\n5. **Chronic subdural hematoma**: Although CT imaging showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, his recurrent falls and chronic antithrombotic treatment put him at risk for a delayed chronic subdural hematoma, which can present subtly.\n6. **Hyponatremia**: His symptoms, such as fatigue and generalized weakness, alongside his use of diuretics, suggest possible dilutional hyponatremia, although it was not explicitly mentioned in the blood tests provided.\n7. **Polyneuropathy due to alcoholism**: Chronic alcohol consumption can lead to a wide range of neurological symptoms, including distal sensory polyneuropathy, which could explain his leg weakness and falls.\n8. **Orthostatic hypotension**: The patient's postural hypotension, particularly given the history of falls, could indicate chronic orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic dysfunction or medication effects.\n9. **B12 deficiency anemia**: Despite normal B12 levels currently, a history of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass puts him at risk for pernicious anemia, contributing to neurological and hematological symptoms.\n10. **Hypothyroidism**: While his thyrotropin levels are normal, hypothyroidism remains a differential due to symptoms such as fatigue, muscle weakness, and hair thinning, which can fluctuate with changes in health status or medication.\n\nThis differential diagnosis covers a broad spectrum of possible conditions contributing to the patient's symptoms, evaluated based on likelihood and clinical presentation."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Ms. Sarah J. Grzybinski Emergency Medicine: A 36-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of episodes of altered mental status. The patient had been well until 6 years before admission, when his wife observed an episode of unusual behavior. During the episode, the patient was found wandering through his home, confused about where he was. He had nonsensical speech and nonpurposeful movements of the arms, and he described having blurry vision. The patients wife noted that he appeared to be aware that his speech was nonsensical. The patient returned to his normal baseline mental status after 30 minutes. He was not able to recall the details of the episode and did not seek medical care. Two years before admission, the patient began to have similar episodes one or two times per year. Four months before admission, the episodes became more frequent, occurring one or two times per month. The episodes most often occurred at night after the patient had consumed alcohol. Despite decreasing his alcohol intake from five to six beers several times per week to two to four beers several times per week, he continued to have intermittent periods of altered mental status and nonsensical speech. He attributed the episodes to stress and did not seek medical care. One day before admission, the patients wife noted that the patient was not himself when he became uncharacteristically upset after learning, while he and his wife were out to dinner, that one of their daughters had had nausea, vomiting, and fever at home. He again had nonsensical speech, along with nonpurposeful jerking movements of his hands. These symptoms diminished after he ate the meal. After the symptoms resolved, the patient noted that he had eaten very little during the day. On the day of admission, the patient vomited early in the morning. Afterward, he appeared diaphoretic, was intermittently confused during the day, and had symptoms similar to those of previous episodes. In the afternoon, he had a telephone conversation with a friend during which he was speaking nonsensically, and the friend became concerned. After speaking with the patients wife, the friend brought the patient to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported no headaches, numbness, tingling, paralysis, gait changes, weakness, or incontinence. He had no tongue biting, fevers, chills, weight loss, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Thirteen years before admission, he had received a diagnosis of eosino-philic esophagitis, which had been complicated by multiple episodes of food impaction that necessitated esophageal dilation. Eleven years before admission, he had undergone sternotomy and laparotomy for repair of an inferior vena cava injury after he had received an abdominal stab wound. The patient took no medications and had no known allergies. He lived with his wife and two young children and worked as a firefighter. He drank two to four beers twice weekly and had quit smoking tobacco 14 years before this presentation. He did not use illicit drugs. His two paternal uncles had alcohol-use disorder. His father had melanoma, his mother had an arterio-venous malformation involving the central nervous system, and a younger brother had lung cancer. There was no family history of heart, pancreatic, or autoimmune disease, and no one in the patients home used insulin or other diabetes medications. On examination, the temperature was 36.5C, the blood pressure 135/85 mm Hg, the heart rate 103 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 69 kg, and the body-mass index BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 22.5. Seven months before admission, the weight had been 70 kg. The patient was confused and agitated, rocking back and forth. He intermittently placed his head between the side rails of his stretcher. He was oriented to person and place and knew the name of the president but did not know the date. Attention, concentration, abstract reasoning, and memory were poor. The patient was unable to calculate the number of quarters a coin worth 25 cents in 2.25 but could calculate the number of quarters in 1.00. Asterixis and vertical nystagmus were present; the remainder of the neurologic and general examination was normal. In the emergency department, the blood glucose level was 38 mg per deciliter 2.1 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter 3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter. A complete blood count and levels of electrolytes, thyrotropin, and creatine kinase were normal, as were results of liver- and renal-function tests. Serum and urine toxicology screening tests were negative. The C-reactive protein level was 48 mg per liter reference range, 8.0, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 38 mm per hour reference range, 0 to 20. Ninety minutes after the initial blood glucose level was obtained, the glucose level, obtained by fingerstick testing, was 20 mg per deciliter 1.1 mmol per liter. A bolus containing a solution of 20 dextrose in water was administered intravenously. The glucose level, obtained by fingerstick testing, rose to 257 mg per deciliter 14.3 mmol per liter, and the patient was no longer confused or agitated. On a repeat neurologic examination, the mental-status examination was normal. Urinalysis performed after the administration of glucose revealed 3 glucose and 1 ketones and was otherwise normal. Diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Insulinoma. ", "prediction": "1. Hypoglycemia: Given the patient's critically low blood glucose levels and resolution of symptoms after glucose administration, recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia are the most likely cause.\n\n2. Insulinoma: This rare pancreatic tumor could cause recurrent, unexplained episodes of hypoglycemia, especially given the absence of exogenous insulin use or other diabetes medications.\n\n3. Alcohol-induced hypoglycemia: Given the patient's history of frequent alcohol consumption and episodes occurring at night, alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is a strong possibility.\n\n4. Adrenal insufficiency: This condition can present with episodes of hypoglycemia and altered mental status, especially in the setting of stress or illness.\n\n5. Factitious hypoglycemia: Although less likely, this diagnosis involves the intentional induction of hypoglycemia through the use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents.\n\n6. Nonketotic hyperosmolar coma: This diagnosis should be considered given the altered mental status, although the patient's presentation is atypical due to the presence of ketonuria.\n\n7. Hepatic encephalopathy: The history of nonsensical speech and asterixis, alongside his eosinophilic esophagitis, could point towards hepatic dysfunction if liver function tests were to deteriorate.\n\n8. Epilepsy: The description of nonsensical speech, nonpurposeful movements, and postictal confusion may suggest a seizure disorder, though the normal EEG and glucose disturbance make it less likely.\n\n9. Thyrotoxicosis: Although there was no direct evidence from the recent thyroid tests, thyrotoxicosis can present with altered mental status and other nonspecific symptoms.\n\n10. Panic attacks: Given the anxious behavior and episodes occurring during stress, panic attacks could potentially explain the patient’s symptoms, although they do not account for the hypoglycemia."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Joshua A. Cohen Medicine: A 57-year-old man presented to this hospital with confusion, cough, fever, and unintentional weight loss. The patient had been in his usual state of health until approximately 7 weeks before this presentation, when malaise and anorexia developed. Four weeks later, a nonproductive cough developed, along with fevers to a maximum temperature of 37.6C, and the patient sought medical attention at another hospital. A chest radiograph showed an opacity in the left lower lobe Fig. 1A. In addition, computed tomography CT of the chest, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed consolidation in the left lower lobe. The patient was admitted to the other hospital, and intravenous cefdinir and azithromycin were administered initially. The next day, treatment was switched to oral levofloxacin. After the patient had received levofloxacin for 6 days, he was discharged home. One day after discharge, fever and cough persisted and the patient was readmitted to the other hospital. A sputum culture was obtained. Treatment with levofloxacin was stopped, and intravenous piperacillintazobactam and vancomycin were administered. After 2 days of parenteral therapy, the patient had some symptom relief; piperacillintazobactam and vancomycin were discontinued, and amoxicillin clavulanic acid was administered. The patient was discharged home with a plan to complete a 10-day course of antibacterial therapy. Fatigue, cough, and malaise continued. Night sweats and fevers to a maximum temperature of 37.8C occurred daily, anorexia worsened, and weakness developed, such that the patient could not walk without assistance. Ten days after the second discharge 2 days before this presentation, the patients wife noted that the patient was incoherent, disoriented, angry, and belligerent, and she found him urinating inappropriately around their home. On the evening of presentation, she found him showering while clothed. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the other hospital. On the patients presentation to that hospital, the temperature was 38.3C, the heart rate 111 beats per minute, the blood pressure 135/73 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94 while he was breathing ambient air. He was confused and unable to answer questions appropriately. Laboratory test results were notable for a tropo-nin I level of 13.4 ng per milliliter reference range, 0.04, a lactate level of 2.4 mmol per liter 22 mg per deciliter reference range, 0.4 to 2.0 mmol per liter; 6 to 18 mg per deciliter, and a white-cell count of 21,800 per cubic millimeter reference range, 4500 to 10,500. Blood cultures were obtained. Electrocardiography reportedly revealed sinus tachycardia, premature atrial beats, and submillimeter inferior ST-segment elevations. Because the patient had tachy-pnea and increased somnolence, the trachea was intubated and mechanical ventilation initiated. Intravenous vancomycin, piperacillintazobactam, ciprofloxacin, lorazepam, and propofol were administered, and the patient was transferred by helicopter to the emergency department of this hospital for consideration of coronary angiography. On the patients arrival at this hospital, a limited history was obtained from his wife. There was no report of chest pain, dyspnea, edema, or symptoms of arrhythmia. He had a history of eczema. He took no medications and had no known ad-verse reactions to medications, but he had a history of anaphylaxis to bee stings. The patient smoked cigarettes and had smoked 1 pack daily for the past 41 years; he also drank 8 to 10 beers per night, occasionally along with 2 to 3 glasses of wine, and smoked marijuana daily. He was a farmer, and he restored farmhouses and cleaned horse stables. He owned sheep and goats and had previously owned exotic birds. There was a family history of cancer; his sister had died of breast cancer at 42 years of age, and his father had died of an unknown cancer when he was in his 40s. The temperature was 37.2C, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/82 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was receiving mechanical ventilation at a rate of 18 breaths per minute, with a tidal volume of 500 ml, a positive end-expira-tory pressure of 8 cm of water, and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.80. The pupils were 2 mm in diameter and sluggishly reactive. When the level of sedation was reduced, the patient opened his eyes and grimaced spontaneously but did not follow commands. He did not blink in response to threat or withdraw from noxious stimuli. The corneal reflexes were intact. The toes were down-going bilaterally. There was no rash. The rest of the examination was normal. Blood levels of phosphorus, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, globulin, lipase, glycated hemoglobin, and thyrotropin and the activated partial-thromboplastin time were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A serum test was negative for acetaminophen, ethanol, tricyclic antidepressants, and salicylates, but urine toxicology screening was positive for cannabi-noids. Cultures of the blood, urine, and sputum were obtained. Nucleic-acid testing of a naso-pharyngeal swab was negative for influenza virus types A and B and respiratory syncytial virus. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 99 beats per minute, with 1-mm concave ST-segment elevations and PR-segment depressions in leads 2, 3, and aVF; a subtle PR-segment elevation in lead aVR; and submillimeter upsloping ST-segment depressions in lateral and anterior leads Fig. 1B. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Melissa C. Price: A chest radiograph showed a persistent patchy opacity in the left lower lobe Fig. 2A, without evidence of pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. CT of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed subtle hypoattenuation and loss of differentiation between gray and white matter in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery, findings that raised concerns about an acute-to-subacute infarct; there was no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the intravenous and oral administration of contrast material, revealed consolidation in the left lower lobe Fig. 2B, which had progressed since CT was last performed, 4 weeks earlier at the other hospital. Changes consistent with segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli were present in the right lower lobe, without evidence of strain on the right side of the heart. A wedge-shaped subpleural consolidation in the right lower lobe Fig. 2C was consistent with a pulmonary infarct. There were new bilateral small pleural effusions. Multiple splenic and renal wedge-shaped hypoattenuating lesions were consistent with infarcts Fig. 2D. Dr. Cohen: While the patient was in the emergency department, a 23-second episode of ventricular tachycardia occurred. Aspirin was administered rectally and magnesium and cefepime intravenously; infusions of propofol, normal sa-line, and amiodarone were also administered. Cardiac catheterization was considered but deferred. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Price: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI and magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck revealed numerous bilateral acute-to-subacute cerebral infarcts Fig. 2E and punctate infarcts scattered throughout the cerebellar hemispheres. A few scattered punctate foci of susceptibility artifact raised concerns about micro-hemorrhages. Time-of-flight imaging revealed a linear susceptibility signal in the distal branches of the superior division of the left middle cerebral artery and loss of flow-related enhancement in the left superior middle cerebral artery, findings suggestive of thrombosis. Transthoracic echocardiography TTE was performed. Dr. Danita Y. Sanborn: TTE revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35, with diffuse hypokinesis that was most prominent in the inferior territory. On studies obtained after the administration of agitated saline, there was no evidence of a patent foramen ovale. The mitral-valve leaflets were focally thickened, with mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation. A small circumferential pericardial effusion was present Fig. 3A. Dr. Cohen: Tests were negative for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgM and IgG antibodies, 2-glycoprotein IgM and IgG antibodies, anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, and antirheumatoid factor antibody; a test for anti-neutrophil antibody was positive at titers of 1:40 and 1:160, with a homogeneous pattern. Intravenous vancomycin and thiamine and enteral doxy-cycline, atorvastatin, omeprazole, and metoprolol were administered. On the second day, the temperature was 38.4C and repeat cultures of the blood, urine, and sputum were obtained. Tests were negative for anti-Ro SSA, anti-La SSB, and antiJo-1 antibodies, as well as IgM and IgG antibodies to brucella and coxiella the agent causing Q fever and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. Ultra-sonography of the arms and legs was negative for a thrombus. Bronchoscopy with bronchoal-veolar lavage BAL revealed blood-tinged secretions in multiple airway segments. Gram staining of the BAL fluid revealed no leukocytes or organisms. Fungal wet preparation and acid-fast stains of the BAL fluid were negative, as was staining for Pneumocystis jiroveci and nucleic-acid testing for influenza virus types A and B and respiratory syncytial virus. In addition, direct fluorescence antibody testing of the BAL fluid was negative for adenovirus, human metapneumo-virus, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis due to an underlying cancer. ", "prediction": "1. Bacterial Endocarditis: The patient's persistent fever, weight loss, and multiple infarcts are highly suggestive of bacterial endocarditis, particularly given his history of cardiac anomalies.\n2. Pulmonary Embolism with Infarction: The presence of segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli and wedge-shaped consolidations consistent with pulmonary infarcts makes this a strong consideration.\n3. Sepsis: The patient's high white-cell count, fever, and signs of systemic infection (e.g., splenic and renal infarcts) indicate a systemic inflammatory response syndrome likely secondary to an infectious etiology.\n4. Multi-organ Thromboembolic Disease: The combination of cerebral, pulmonary, splenic, and renal infarcts suggests a hypercoagulable state or disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n5. Alcoholic Cardiomyopathy: His heavy alcohol use and reduced ejection fraction on TTE are consistent with the diagnosis of alcoholic cardiomyopathy, contributing to his cardiac symptoms.\n6. Cryptogenic Stroke: Multiple cerebral infarcts without a clear cardioembolic source require consideration of a cryptogenic stroke, particularly given the negative workup for common stroke etiologies.\n7. Autoimmune Vasculitis: Despite negative serologies, ANCA-associated vasculitis cannot be ruled out completely, especially with the multifocal infarcts and inflammatory markers.\n8. Tuberculosis (TB): The chronicity of his symptoms, night sweats, weight loss, and unresolving pulmonary consolidation warrant exclusion of pulmonary TB, even though initial tests were negative.\n9. Nonbacterial Thrombotic Endocarditis: This could explain the embolic phenomena in multiple organs, often associated with malignancy or autoimmune disease, although no primary source has been identified.\n10. HIV/AIDS: Given his chronic symptoms, progressive weight loss, recurrent infections, and opportunistic illness pattern, undiagnosed HIV/AIDS should be considered and tested for, despite limited initial evidence.\n\n"}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Blake A. Niccum Medicine: A 64-year-old man was admitted to this hospital in the spring because of acute renal failure. The patient had been generally well until 4.5 months before this admission, when fevers, malaise, mild cough, and pain in the left flank developed. He was evaluated at an outside urgent care clinic, where chest radiography was reportedly normal. A clinical diagnosis of sinusitis was made, and amoxicillinclavulanic acid was prescribed. When symptoms did not abate, doxycycline was prescribed. The flank pain was attributed to muscular strain, and a short course of prednisone and cyclobenzaprine was administered. Four months before this admission, a fever with a temperature of up to 38.9C and worsening cough developed. The patient was evaluated in an urgent care clinic at this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.6C, the heart rate 58 beats per minute, the blood pressure 125/71 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98 while he was breathing ambient air. Auscultation of the lungs revealed crackles in the left lower lung field; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiography revealed faint air-space opacities in the left lower lobe and left perihilar region, and amoxicillinclavulanic acid was prescribed for empirical treatment of pneumonia. Dr. Victorine V. Muse: Two months before this admission, repeat chest radiography revealed persistence of the air-space opacity in the left perihilar region. Three weeks later, computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Because of a known allergy to intravenous contrast material, prednisone and diphenhydramine were administered prophylactically. The images showed centrilobular nodules and patchy opacities in both lung bases, as well as mediastinal and left hilar lymph-adenopathy Fig. 1A and 1B. Dr. Niccum: Two days later, early satiety, nausea, and nonbloody diarrhea developed, along with orthopnea, edema in the legs, abdominal distention, decreased urine output, and weight gain. Symptoms progressed during the subsequent 3 weeks. Routine laboratory testing revealed a creatinine level of 5.78 mg per deciliter 511 mmol per liter normal range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter 53 to 133 mmol per liter and a blood urea nitrogen level of 80 mg per deciliter 29 mmol per liter normal range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter 3 to 9 mmol per liter. The patient was referred to the emergency department at this hospital for management of acute renal failure. The patient had a history of congenital aortic stenosis due to a subaortic membrane, hypertro-phic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, complete heart block, ascending aortic aneurysm with severe aortic insufficiency, diverticulosis, and gout. He had undergone a subaortic membrane resection when he was 10 years of age and an open revision surgery with aortic-valve repair and septal myomectomy when he was 50 years of age. When he was 52 years of age, a permanent pacemaker was placed after complete heart block had developed. He had undergone pulmonary-vein isolation when he was 58 years of age. Medications were rivaroxaban, sotalol, eplerenone, furosemide, simvastatin, potassium chloride, allo-purinol, and ibuprofen. Known medication allergies included intravenous iodinated contrast material, which caused hives. The patient lived with his wife in a suburban community in New England and had recently retired from a career in the information technology industry. He had traveled to Ventura County in California the preceding autumn, as well as to Europe and to the southeastern United States several years earlier. He had a 20-pack-year history of cigarette smoking and had quit smoking 9 years earlier. He drank alcohol socially and had never used illicit drugs. His mother had congestive heart failure and his father had peripheral vascular disease. His nephew had a thoracic aortic aneurysm, and his brother had died from a ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysm. On examination, the patient appeared well and was not in acute distress. The temperature was 36.5°C, the pulse 60 beats per minute, the blood pressure 135//60 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while he was breathing ambient air. The heart sounds were regular, and a systolic murmur (2/6) was present at the right upper sternal border. There was edema in the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal; specifically, there were no ulcerations noted on the skin or oropharynx, and he had no rashes. Urinalysis revealed 3+ blood and 2+ protein, and microscopic examination of the sediment revealed 10 to 20 red cells per high-power field, including acanthocytes. Results of kidney function tests were unchanged from those obtained earlier that day; results of additional laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder revealed echogenic kidneys but no evidence of hydronephrosis. Intravenous methylprednisolone was initiated empirically for the treatment of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. The next day, additional laboratory test results were received. Tests for hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis C antibody, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen, and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 were negative. An assay for antinuclear antibodies was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern; cryoglobulins and antibodies to the Goodpasture antigen were not detected. Blood levels of C3 and C4 were normal. Urine tests for Bence Jones protein were negative, and results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. A test for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) was positive, with a perinuclear staining pattern, and an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay confirmed the presence of myeloperoxidase ANCA at a titer of 743 U (reference range, <2.8). Oral cyclophosphamide therapy was begun. On hospital day 3, a central venous catheter was placed, and therapeutic plasma exchange was initiated; intravenous methylprednisolone treatment was discontinued, and administration of high-dose oral prednisone was begun. On hospital day 6, intravenous rituximab was administered. On hospital day 7, intermittent hemodialysis was initiated owing to persistent uremia and acidosis. On hospital day 14, a fever with a temperature of up to 38.4°C developed, along with a mild cough and sore throat. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.010 and 2+ bacteria; nitrites and leukocyte esterase were not detected. On hospital day 16, the urine culture grew abundant Enterobacter cloacae, and intravenous cefepime treatment was initiated. After seven sessions of therapeutic plasma exchange and administration of two rituximab infusions, the patient was discharged home. Prednisone (40 mg daily), cyclophosphamide, and ciprofloxacin were prescribed. After discharge, a fever with a temperature of up to 38.9°C persisted, as did fatigue, malaise, and watery diarrhea. The patient also reported the development of painful oral ulcers. Two days after discharge, dyspnea on exertion developed, along with productive cough, and the patient returned to the emergency department at this hospital. On arrival, the patient appeared ill and in respiratory distress. The temperature was 36.1°C, the pulse 104 beats per minute, the blood pressure 140//70 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 54 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. Examination revealed numerous shallow ulcerations on the tongue and lips, diffuse wheezing with inspiratory crackles, and marked edema in the legs; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cytomegalovirus DNA was detected in the blood (4680 international units [IU] per milliliter). Blood samples were obtained for culture. The patient was readmitted to this hospital. Dr. Muse: Radiography of the chest revealed pulmonary interstitial edema with patchy opacities in the left retrocardiac region. CT of the chest revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities with intralobular septal thickening and worsening mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy (Fig. 1C and 1D). Dr. Niccum: Intravenous cefepime, vancomycin, and azithromycin were administered empirically. The next day, hemodialysis was performed, and 4 liters of fluid were removed by ultrafiltration for the management of congestive heart failure. During the last hour of the dialysis session, the dyspnea began to worsen and hypoxemia developed; supplemental oxygen was administered through a nonrebreather face mask. Ipratropiumalbuterol nebulizers were administered, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for management of hypoxemic respiratory failure. A diagnostic test was performed. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Disseminated coccidioidomycosis. ", "prediction": "1. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA): The presence of myeloperoxidase ANCA with a perinuclear pattern (p-ANCA), respiratory symptoms, renal failure, and constitutional symptoms such as fever and malaise are highly suggestive of GPA.\n2.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH): Given the patient's respiratory distress, pulmonary findings on imaging, and hematuria, DAH must be considered as part of ANCA-associated vasculitis.\n4. Anti-GBM disease: Although Goodpasture antigen antibodies were not detected, the combination of pulmonary and renal symptoms warrants consideration of this disease.\n5. Intravenous contrast-induced nephropathy: The history of contrast allergy and recent imaging with contrast might have exacerbated renal dysfunction.\n6. Infective endocarditis: The patient's cardiac history and presentation of fevers, along with new pulmonary findings, necessitate consideration of endocarditis as a source of emboli.\n7.

Chu: A 44-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Approximately 6 months before admission, the patient began to have early satiety, nausea approximately 30 minutes after eating small amounts of food, and intermittent anorexia. He began to consume primarily liquids for breakfast and lunch and would skip dinner; during the next 5 months, he lost 9 kg. One month before admission, the patient was admitted to another hospital because of fever, malaise, neck pain, photophobia, retro-orbital pain, and headache. The temperature was 38.5C, the heart rate 118 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 94/72 mm Hg. The white-cell count was 28,600 per microliter reference range, 4500 to 10,800; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood samples were obtained for culture. Computed tomography CT of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was reportedly normal. Empirical vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and dexametha-sone were administered intravenously. A lumbar puncture opening pressure not recorded revealed cloudy cerebrospinal fluid CSF with 4 red cells per microliter and 1306 white cells per microliter, of which 83 were neutrophils reference value, 25, 12 were monocytes, and 5 were lymphocytes. Grams staining of the CSF revealed no organisms; the CSF protein level was 98 mg per deciliter reference range, 15 to 45 and the glucose level was 68 mg per deciliter 3.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 35 to 65 mg per deciliter 1.9 to 3.6 mmol per liter. On the third day at the other hospital, dysuria, nausea, and episodes of hemop-tysis and diarrhea developed. CT of the chest and abdomen was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material; the results were reportedly unremarkable. On the fifth hospital day, after CSF culture revealed no growth and polymerase-chain-reaction PCR testing for herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 was negative, antimicrobial and glucocorticoid therapies were discontinued and the patient was discharged home. The vitamin B12 level and results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal; other laboratory test results obtained the day before discharge are shown in Table 1. After the patients discharge from the other hospital, new, near-constant epigastric pain developed. Approximately 1 hour after meals, nausea and vomiting occurred, with diffuse abdominal bloating and cramping. In addition, watery diarrhea began to occur twice daily, without hema-tochezia or melena. One week after discharge, the patients primary care physician prescribed omeprazole. The patient lost an additional 14 kg. Approximately 3 weeks later, he presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The patients medical history was notable for depression, lumbar pain, and vitamin D deficiency. Intermittent diffuse headache persisted in the 3 weeks after discharge from the other hospital, and the patient reported low-grade fever. A review of systems was negative for night sweats, chills, neck pain, photophobia, vision changes, chest pain, dyspnea, cough, coryza, sore throat, oral ulcers, back pain, dysuria, hema-turia, rashes, joint or muscle pain, edema, and pruritus. Medications included venlafaxine, cho-lecalciferol, and omeprazole. The patient took an herbal supplement of unknown type in the week after discharge from the other hospital. He had never used nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. He had no known medication allergies. The patient grew up on an island in the Caribbean and had immigrated to the United States 10 years earlier; he had last returned to the Caribbean 4 months before admission. He had traveled extensively in the northeastern and Mountain West regions of the United States. He was married with one child but had no known sick contacts. He drank one beer per day and had never smoked cigarettes; he occasionally smoked marijuana. There was no family history of gastrointestinal infections, gastrointestinal cancers his mother had ovarian cancer, peptic-ulcer disease, pancreatitis, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune conditions, or malabsorption syndromes. The temperature was 37.2C, the heart rate 107 beats per minute, the blood pressure 101/57 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air; the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 18.6. Examination was notable for cachexia. The ab-domen was soft and nondistended, with no or-ganomegaly. There was mild epigastric tenderness, without rebound or guarding. No rashes, skin ulcerations, or lymphadenopathy were noted. The remainder of the examination was normal. The international normalized ratio and blood levels of magnesium, phosphorus, lipase, vitamin B12, folate, globulin, and IgA were normal, as were the results of a urinalysis; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed right bundle-branch block, with no evidence of ischemia. Dr. Theodore T. Pierce: A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis Fig. 1, obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed diffuse mild distention of the large and small bowel without a transition point to indicate a bowel obstruction. The presence of diffuse mild thickening of the bowel wall, mural enhancement, and prominent mesenteric vessels suggested diffuse inflammation. Additional nonspecific findings included a reduced number of jejunal folds and an increased number of ileal folds collectively known as jejunoileal fold pattern reversal as well as mesenteric lymphade-nopathy. Dr. Chu: Normal saline was administered intravenously, and sucralfate and dicyclomine were given orally. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Diarrhea and abdominal pain persisted on the second hospital day. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies and antigen, Treponema pallidum antibodies, Clostridium difficile antigen, and tissue transglu-taminase IgA were negative. Blood testing for Helicobacter pylori IgG was positive; however, a stool test for H. pylori antigen was negative. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.

Keyes Pediatrics: A 32-day-old male infant was transferred to the emergency department and admitted to this hospital for evaluation of suspected abusive head trauma. On the evening of admission, the patients mother called emergency medical services and reported that the patient had fallen. The mother reported that the infant had been well until that evening, when she placed him on her bed before briefly stepping a short distance away to warm up a bottle of formula in the microwave. She heard a thud and then returned to find that the baby had fallen less than 1 m 2 to 3 ft from the bed to the hardwood floor, where he was lying face down and crying. She picked him up immediately to console him. After continuing to cry for several minutes, the patient suddenly became quiet; this behavior was worrisome to the mother and prompted her to call for emergency medical assistance. During the phone call, the baby resumed crying. On arrival of emergency medical services personnel several minutes later, the infant appeared well and was bottle-feeding without difficulty; there were no signs of injury. He was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. At the other hospital, the patients mother reported that the baby had not lost consciousness or vomited during the event and was behaving normally. On examination, the patient was alert, regarded the examiner, cried when he was undressed, and calmed when he was swaddled. The vital signs were normal. The head was normocephalic and atraumatic. There were no bruises or subconjunctival hemorrhages, and results of abdominal, musculoskeletal, and neurologic examinations were normal, as was the remainder of the physical examination. Dr. Paul A. Caruso: Computed tomography CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed scattered punctate densities in the right and left superior occipital lobes, a density 3 mm in diameter extending along the left tentorial leaflet, mild prominence of both opercula, and mild diffuse prominence of the extraaxial spaces Fig. 1. Dr. Keyes: A report of suspected abusive head trauma was filed with the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families, and the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. On arrival at this hospital, a history was obtained from the patients mother. The patient was born at another hospital after 37 weeks of gestation; labor was induced because of maternal pre-eclampsia, and the infant was delivered vaginally. At delivery, a nuchal cord was unwrapped from the babys neck. He received routine newborn care and was feeding and growing well. Two weeks before the current evaluation, he was seen in the emergency department of the first hospital because of three episodes of vomiting; abdominal ultrasonography performed during that visit did not reveal findings consistent with pyloric stenosis. During the 10 to 14 days before the current evaluation, the patient was fussy. He had a diaper rash, for which his pediatrician prescribed topical nystatin; in addition, his mother was applying a zinc oxidecontaining cream to the rash. He took no other medications and had no known allergies. His mother had a history of asthma, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety; she had placed frequent calls to emergency medical services because of concerns about her health but was often reassured by the responding personnel and not transported to a hospital. Both of the patients maternal grandparents had a history of substance use disorder, and his maternal grandmother had died of a heroin overdose. The patient lived with his mother in housing funded by the Department of Mental Health. They were visited each week by a case manager and received social support from an aunt. The patients mother was a high school graduate and was certified as an emergency medical technician; she had been in the custody of the Department of Children and Families during adolescence and had a 2-year-old daughter who had been placed with the aunt at the recommendation of the Department of Children and Families because of concerns about the mothers mental health issues. Although the case involving the daughter was closed, the mother reported that she still had contact with her former social worker, who continued to provide support. The pregnancy with the patient was unplanned and occurred near the beginning of the mothers relationship with the father of the baby; this relationship was characterized by young age and intimate-partner violence, and the couple separated before the birth of the infant. The mother was the patients primary caregiver, although on two occasions the most recent one occurring 6 days before this evaluation, the baby had spent time with his father. On examination, the patient was alert and vigorous and appeared well. The temperature was 36.6C, the pulse 161 beats per minute, the blood pressure 86/50 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 56 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 3.99 kg 18th percentile, the length 53 cm 17th percentile, and the head circumference 35 cm 2nd percentile. There were no exterior signs of facial or scalp trauma, and the anterior fontanelle was soft and flat. An intraoral examination did not reveal lesions; the lingual frenulum was intact. The abdomen was soft, without distention, tenderness, or masses. Examination of the skin revealed scattered skin-colored papules 1 mm in diameter on the chest and face, a crescent-shaped erythematous patch above the right nipple, a blanching erythematous macule 3 mm in diameter on the left buttock, erythema of the intergluteal cleft, and a scratch 3 mm by 2 mm behind the left knee. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Caruso: Susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging MRI, performed 16 hours after the head CT, revealed a lobular focus of hemorrhage 15 mm by 2 mm in the right superior occipital gyrus that was probably chronic and corresponded to the 2-mm punctate density seen on noncontrast-enhanced CT. A similar focus of hemorrhage in the left superior occipital gyrus was also probably chronic. A focus of hemorrhage in the right caudothalamic groove and two foci of hemorrhage or mineralization 3 mm in diameter in the bilateral choroid plexuses were also seen Fig. 2. Dr. Keyes: Additional evaluation was performed, and management decisions were made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Intraparenchymal and intracranial hemorrhage presumably due to birth trauma. ", "prediction": "1. Abusive head trauma: The presence of multiple cerebral hemorrhages and the social history of the mother raise significant concerns for potential physical abuse.\n2. Accidental fall: The reported fall from a bed to a hardwood floor could potentially explain the head injuries observed, despite the atypical presentation.\n3. Birth-related injury: Chronic hemorrhages may suggest injuries sustained during the traumatic birth process, such as a nuchal cord or delivery complications.\n4. Coagulopathy: An underlying bleeding disorder could explain the widespread hemorrhages despite a minor fall.\n5. Vitamin K deficiency: Inadequate vitamin K, particularly in a newborn with limited newborn vitamin K prophylaxis, can precipitate bleeding and hemorrhage.\n6. Metabolic disorder: Conditions such as glutaric aciduria type 1, which can present with subdural hemorrhages and intracranial bleeding, need to be considered.\n7. Vascular malformations: Congenital vascular anomalies such as arteriovenous malformations could present with intracranial hemorrhage.\n8. Osteogenesis imperfecta: This genetic disorder can make bones brittle and more prone to fractures and hemorrhages, even with minimal trauma.\n9. Non-accidental trauma undiagnosed: Effects of intimate-partner violence or other environmental stresses on the mother might indirectly expose the infant to unrecognized harm.\n10. Infection: A severe infection or sepsis, particularly with organisms like Streptococcus pneumoniae, might lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation and associated hemorrhages."}

Lopes: An 89-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of recurrent bloody stools. Two years before the current evaluation, the patient underwent repair of a right inguinal hernia. After he recovered from that procedure, he had intermittent pain in the right lower quadrant. Four months before the current evaluation, he was admitted to this hospital for diffuse abdominal pain followed by presyncope during an attempt to defecate. Examination was notable for bilateral lower abdominal tenderness and a crescendodecrescendo systolic murmur grade 26 at the left sternal border. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Lauren A. Roller: Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis Fig. 1A and 1B, performed after the administration of oral but not intravenous contrast material, showed diverticulosis of the descending and sigmoid colon, with focal areas of hyperemia and wall thickening in the distal descending colon. There were atherosclerotic changes in the aorta and aortic branches, with a 36-mm infra-renal aortic aneurysm. Small radiopaque stones were present in the gallbladder and common bile duct. Dr. Lopes: Several bowel movements with loose, nonbloody stools occurred, with a decrease in abdominal pain. Empirical oral ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were prescribed, and the patient was discharged on the third hospital day. Two months later, the patient was readmitted to this hospital with a 3-week history of progressively bloody stools and crampy, diffuse abdominal pain, which had awakened him from sleep. The pain was worst before bowel movements, which occurred approximately five times per day. Increasing amounts of red blood were present in the stools. The patient reported no fever, anorexia, nausea, or vomiting. Examination revealed abdominal tenderness, primarily in the lower quadrants, and the presence of soft, red-brown, formed stool in the rectal vault that was guaiac-positive. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Two units of packed red cells were transfused. Aspirin was discontinued, and a stool specimen was submitted for microbiologic evaluation. Dr. Roller: CT of the abdomen and pelvis Fig. 1C, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, showed a long segment of circumferential wall thickening in the rectum and sigmoid colon and diverticu-losis of the distal descending colon, without diverticulitis. Dr. Lopes: Empirical treatment with oral cipro-floxacin and metronidazole was started. On the second hospital day, nucleic-acid testing of stool was positive for Clostridioides difficile formerly Clostridium difficile toxin; ciprofloxacin was discontinued. Three days later, abdominal discomfort persisted, and there were four or five bowel movements per day with blood and intermittent mucus in the stools. Oral vancomycin therapy was started, and metronidazole was discontinued. During the next 3 days, the frequency of bowel movements decreased to two per day, and the patient was discharged to complete 2 weeks of oral vancomycin therapy. Two weeks after discharge, the frequency of bowel movements increased to four to six per day, with increasingly bloody stools but without abdominal pain. The dose of vancomycin was increased. During the next week, the frequency of bowel movements with bloody stools increased to eight per day, with intermittent incontinence of stool. The patient was admitted for the third time to this hospital. On examination, there was mild bilateral lower abdominal tenderness. The stool was guaiac-positive, and testing for C. difficile toxin was negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of the stool showed normal enteric flora and no pathogenic bacteria. On the fifth day, flexible sigmoidoscopy Fig. 2A and 2B revealed diffusely hemorrhagic, erythematous, congested, eroded, friable mucosa in the sigmoid colon, with spontaneous bleeding and pseudopolyps. Biopsy specimens were obtained. Dr. Lawrence R. Zukerberg: The next day, pathological analysis of the biopsy specimens revealed evidence of markedly active chronic colitis, including surface erosion, neutrophilic cryptitis, crypt loss, and replacement of the lamina pro-pria with a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate Fig. 2C. Scattered cytomegalovirus CMV inclusion bodies were detected on immunostaining Fig. 2D. Dr. Lopes: Ganciclovir therapy was started, and laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Over the next 4 days, there was no decrease in the number of daily bowel movements, but the number of bloody stools decreased. Intermittent anorexia and crampy lower abdominal pain occurred. Ganciclovir was switched to valganciclovir. Over the next 6 days, the frequency of bowel movements decreased to two to five per day, with a modest decrease in anorexia and abdominal pain. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility. Two weeks later, the patient had persistently loose, yellow, foul-smelling stools. One week later, bloody stools recurred, and after a marked increase in bloody stools over the following week, the patient was readmitted to this hospital. He reported reduced appetite, an unintentional loss of 3 kg during the past month, tenderness on the left side of the abdomen, and diffuse weakness. A review of systems was negative for fever, other bleeding and bruising, and genitourinary, cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal, and dermatologic symptoms. There were no specific sick contacts at the rehabilitation facility or residents with reported gastrointestinal illnesses. The patient’s medical history was notable for coronary artery disease, moderate aortic stenosis, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, chronic renal insufficiency, glaucoma, and a thyroid nodule; he had undergone aortocoronarybypass grafting. Outpatient medications included valganciclovir, simvastatin, cholecalciferol, mirtazapine, a multivitamin, and latanoprost eyedrops, as well as loperamide and diphenoxylate with atropine as needed. There were no adverse reactions to medications. The patient had retired from military service. He had no recent history of travel. He had last used tobacco three decades earlier, and he did not drink alcohol or use illicit substances. His mother had had coronary artery disease and his father had had a stroke; there was no family history of infectious or autoimmune disease. The temperature was 36.1°C, the heart rate 89 beats per minute, the blood pressure 117//58 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was a frail-appearing elderly man with dry mucous membranes and impaired dentition but no oropharyngeal lesions. Cardiac auscultation revealed a crescendo–decrescendo murmur (grade 2/6) at the left sternal border. An abdominal examination revealed tenderness on palpation of the right lower quadrant, without distention, rebound guarding, or organomegaly. A rectal examination revealed only a few small external hemorrhoids, no palpable fissures or masses, slightly reduced rectal tone, and guaiac-positive, lightred, loose stool with mucus. Peripheral pulses were intact, and there were no rashes. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, lactate, bilirubin, amylase, lipase, and troponin T and the results of liver-function tests were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Stool testing for C. difficile toxin and Shiga toxin was negative, as was examination of the stool for ova and parasites; a test for Entamoeba histolytica antibodies was also negative. A stool specimen was obtained for culture. Dr. Roller: CT of the abdomen (Fig. 3A and 3B), performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed diffuse bowel-wall thickening and inflammatory changes involving the rectum and the entire colon. There was again evidence of calcific atherosclerosis in the abdominal aorta and aortic branches, with a 37-mm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with mural thrombus. Dr. Lopes: Treatment with oral vancomycin and intravenous ganciclovir was started. The patient had bowel movements with bloody stools every 2 to 3 hours. On the second hospital day, flexible sigmoidoscopy (Fig. 3C and 3D) revealed diffuse severe colonic inflammation, erythema, edema, friability, and deep ulcerations in the sigmoid colon and rectum. Dr. Zukerberg: Pathological examination of biopsy specimens of the rectum and sigmoid colon (Fig. 3E and 3F) revealed evidence of severely active chronic colitis, including surface ulceration, replacement of the lamina propria with a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, and rare cholesterol emboli in small vessels. Immunohistochemical stains for CMV, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, and adenovirus were negative, as was a shell-vial culture for CMV. Dr. Lopes: A diagnosis was made.Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Ulcerative colitis. ", "prediction": "1. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis: Given the chronic colitis with CMV inclusion bodies on initial biopsy and partial response to ganciclovir, recurrent CMV colitis is highly likely despite negative follow-up CMV testing.\n2. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): The diffuse, severe colonic inflammation with ulceration and chronic symptoms are consistent with underlying IBD, which can be exacerbated by infections like CMV.\n3. Clostridioides difficile colitis: The initial positive test for C. difficile and subsequent persistent gastrointestinal symptoms suggest potential ongoing or recurrent C. difficile infection masked by other underlying issues.\n4. Ischemic colitis: His history of atherosclerosis, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and episodic bloody stools raise concern for ischemic colitis due to compromised blood flow to the colon.\n5. Diverticulosis with bleeding: The findings of diverticulosis on CT scans correlate with recurrent bleeding episodes and are a common cause of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in the elderly.\n6. Gastrointestinal malignancy: Although less likely with the given data, recurrent bloody stools and weight loss in an elderly patient necessitate ruling out colorectal cancer or other malignancies.\n7. CMV-negative infectious colitis: Despite negative cultures for typical pathogens, less common infectious agents or a resilient strain could be contributing to his colitis.\n8. Infective endocarditis: Given the systolic murmur and a history of aortic stenosis, there’s a possibility of infective endocarditis presenting with colitis.\n9. Drug-induced colitis: His medications, potentially including recent antibiotics and antivirals, could have side effects causing gastrointestinal disturbances and colitis.\n10. Autoimmune enteropathy: Considering the chronicity and refractoriness of his symptoms, an autoimmune component against the gastrointestinal tract, despite lacking typical systemic symptoms, should be considered."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Ryan J. Sullivan: A 64-year-old man presented to this hospital for evaluation of a mass in the left frontal and left parietal lobes. Four weeks before this presentation, while residing at his home in Florida, the patient began to have clumsiness of the right upper arm, as well as difficulty writing his name, holding a toothbrush, and coordinating activities with his right hand. Two weeks later, the symptoms in the right hand persisted, and the patient presented to his primary care doctor near his home for evaluation. Computed tomography CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed an amorphous hypodensity in the left frontal lobe with associated mild local mass effect. Treatment with oral dexamethasone was initiated, but the patients symptoms did not resolve. He and his wife subsequently traveled to Boston, and he presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation and care. At the emergency department, the patient reported 4 weeks of clumsiness and weakness of the right arm. He had no other symptoms. He had a history of melanoma of the left shoulder and had undergone excision of the affected tissue at another hospital 4 years before this evaluation; a lymph node biopsy had reportedly been negative, and no additional therapy had been administered. Medications included dexamethasone. There were no known drug allergies. He had smoked a few cigars per week for the past 10 years and did not consume alcohol or use illicit drugs. He worked as an executive and lived with his wife, splitting time between Florida and the New England area, where they were renovating their home. He had no known sick contacts. His mother had died of colon cancer at 72 years of age; his father had died of an unknown cause when he was in his 30s. On examination, the temperature was 36.6C, the blood pressure 158/95 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. Movements of the right hand and fingers were slower and less precise than those of the left hand and fingers. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Florian J. Fintelmann: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head was performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material. An axial T1-weighted image obtained without contrast enhancement showed focal hyperintensity in the left frontal lobe, which corresponded to a ring-enhancing lesion surrounded by edema Fig. 1A through 1C. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a solid, noncalcified nodule in the right upper lung that measured 2.2 cm in diameter Fig. 1D. Dr. Sullivan: CT-guided fine-needle aspiration of the nodule in the right lung revealed malignant cells consistent with metastatic melanoma. Eleven days later, the brain lesion was resected, and pathological examination of the tissue revealed a malignant tumor consistent with metastatic melanoma. Treatment with dexamethasone, levetiracetam, and omeprazole was started. One week after the resection procedure, the patient was evaluated at the melanoma center of this hospital. During the next 2 months, he received adjuvant radiation therapy to the cranial resection cavity. The dose of dexamethasone was tapered, and treatment with ipilimumab plus nivolumab was initiated. Five days after initiation of the second cycle of ipilimumab plus nivolumab therapy 25 days after the initiation of the first cycle of therapy and 3 months after the diagnosis of metastatic melanoma, shortness of breath, cough, and fever developed. The patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 37.2C, the blood pressure 108/47 mm Hg, the pulse 92 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 48 while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was alert and awake, with no signs of respiratory distress. Examination of the lungs revealed crackles in both bases. The remainder of the examination was normal. Oxygen was administered through a nonrebreather face mask, and imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Fintelmann: A chest radiograph showed low lung volumes, new diffuse interstitial opacities, and bilateral hilar fullness Fig. 2A. CT of the chest ruled out pulmonary embolism and revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities, interlobular septal thickening, and mild traction bron-chiectasis Fig. 2B. These findings were new relative to the baseline staging studies obtained 3 months earlier. Dr. Sullivan: The results of blood tests of renal and liver function were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the oncology service in this hospital. Nucleic acid testing for influenza A and B viruses was negative, as were tests of a naso-pharyngeal swab for adenovirus, metapneumo-virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainflu-enza virus types 1, 2, and 3 antigens. A sputum culture and smear, a mycobacterial culture and smear, and an induced-sputum specimen to test for Pneumocystis jirovecii were obtained. Treatment decisions were made.

Immune-related pneumonitis: Given the recent initiation of ipilimumab and nivolumab, this patient's diffuse interstitial opacities, ground-glass opacities, and clinical symptoms are highly suggestive of immune-related pneumonitis, a known complication of immune checkpoint inhibitors.\n2. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP): Considering the patient’s immunocompromised state from recent treatment and corticosteroid use, PJP remains a possibility despite pending confirmatory testing.\n3. Drug-induced pneumonitis: The patient’s recent drug history includes multiple agents that could potentially cause pulmonary toxicity, contributing to the new radiographic findings and respiratory symptoms.\n4. Viral pneumonitis: Despite negative nucleic acid tests for common respiratory viruses, the patient’s symptoms and imaging findings could still represent an atypical or undetected viral pneumonia.\n5. Bacterial pneumonia: The patient's clinical presentation could also be consistent with bacterial pneumonia, despite initial tests being negative, especially given his immunocompromised status.\n6. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP): This condition can present with similar imaging findings and is a possibility in the setting of recent cancer therapies.\n7. Acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP): Similar to ARDS, AIP should be considered given the radiographic pattern and acute presentation, though it is more commonly idiopathic.\n8. Melanoma metastasis to lungs: Although less likely, the diffuse pattern of lung involvement could theoretically represent an unusual spread of metastatic melanoma.\n9. Pulmonary embolism with infarction: While CT ruled out acute embolism, chronic pulmonary emboli leading to infarction and secondary lung changes are a rare but possible diagnosis.\n10. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: This could result from environmental exposure, although it is less likely given the patient’s recent oncology treatments and clinical history."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Christian C. Mewaldt Medicine: An 83-year-old man was transferred to this hospital because of pancytopenia and acute renal failure. Five days before this presentation, the patient was found conscious on his bedroom floor; he had been well the previous evening. A caregiver noticed that the patient had new generalized weakness and unsteadiness and was unable to walk with a walker. He was taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. The temperature was 38.1C, the pulse 103 beats per minute, the blood pressure 165/55 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95 while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was alert and oriented to self and date of birth. The cardiac, pulmonary, and abdominal examinations were normal. The creatinine level was 3.2 mg per deciliter 283 mol per liter; reference range, 0.7 to 1.2 mg per deciliter 62 to 106 mol per liter, increased from his baseline level of 2.4 mg per deciliter 212 mol per liter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph showed mild pulmonary congestion. Computed tomography CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a right parietal ventriculo-peritoneal shunt terminating in the left lateral ventricle that had been placed 2 years earlier because of normal pressure hydrocephalus. The bilateral ventricles were smaller than they had been on previous imaging studies. An infusion of sodium bicarbonate, a single dose of ceftriaxone, and subcutaneous heparin were administered. On the second day at the other hospital, the white-cell count was 3800 per microliter reference range, 4500 to 10,500, the hemoglobin level 12.8 g per deciliter reference range, 13.3 to 16.3, and the platelet count 75,000 per microliter reference range, 150,000 to 400,000. The d-dimer level was 229,926 ng per milliliter reference range, 0 to 500, the fibrinogen level 180 mg per deciliter reference range, 200 to 393, the international normalized ratio 1.2 reference range, 0.9 to 1.1, and the prothrombin time 13.5 seconds reference range, 10.6 to 13.4. Subcutaneous heparin was stopped. During the next 3 days, pancytopenia worsened and the creatinine level increased. On the fifth hospital day, doxycycline was administered, and the patient was transferred to this hospital for further treatment. The patient had a history of benign prostatic hypertrophy, chronic kidney disease, normal pressure hydrocephalus, mild dementia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease, which had led to multivessel coronary-artery bypass grafting 14 years earlier and to the placement of drug-eluting coronary stents 11 months before this evaluation. He had been treated for Lyme disease 3 years before this evaluation. Medications included aspirin, clopidogrel, atorva-statin, ezetimibe, isosorbide mononitrate, meto-prolol succinate, and amlodipine. Penicillin had reportedly caused anaphylaxis. The patient was a widower and lived in a house in New England with his son, daughter-in-law, and grandson, without pets. He had previously worked as a home inspector; in retirement, he enjoyed reading and spending time outside. The patient used a walker for ambulation and was able to perform most activities of daily living; he required assistance from his family and home health services for activities requiring more advanced executive function. He did not use alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. His mother had had heart disease; his father had had dementia. The temperature was 37.3C, the pulse 93 beats per minute, the blood pressure 153/68 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 90 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 25.7. On examination, the patient was oriented to self and location. The mucous membranes were dry, and the neck was supple. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy, bruising, or rash. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Blood cultures were obtained. Blood levels of vitamin B12 and folate were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Eric W. Zhang: CT of the chest Fig. 1A, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed symmetric pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions. There were scattered mildly enlarged mediasti-nal lymph nodes, measuring up to 1.4 cm in short-axis diameter. CT of the abdomen and pelvis Fig. 1B and 1C, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed cholelithiasis with trace pericholecystic fluid and mild gallbladder-wall thickening. Followup ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant revealed cholelithiasis without evidence of chole-cystitis; Murphys sign was negative. Dr. Mewaldt: Doxycycline and intravenous fluids containing sodium bicarbonate were continued. Metoprolol, amlodipine, and isosorbide mono-nitrate were administered. On the second day at this hospital, the hematology service was consulted. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed red cells with hypochromic forms, scattered schistocytes 3 per high-power field, and echinocytes. Atypical neu-trophils without dysplasia were present, and there were no immature forms or blasts. The platelets were decreased in number and well granulated, without clumping and with some scattered larger forms. On the third hospital day, tretinoin often called all-trans retinoic acid was administered because of concerns about acute promyelocytic leukemia APL. On the fourth hospital day, additional diagnostic test results were received.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection. ", "prediction": "1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The increased creatinine levels and history of chronic kidney disease suggest acute exacerbation due to dehydration or other underlying causes.\n2.

Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP): Pancytopenia, schistocytes on blood smear, and neurological symptoms such as unsteadiness may point to TTP.\n7. Cholecystitis: Although current testing shows no acute cholecystitis, the presence of cholelithiasis with trace pericholecystic fluid and mild gallbladder-wall thickening warrants consideration.\n8. Cardiovascular Disease: Given the history of coronary artery disease and recent use of drug-eluting stents, acute cardiovascular issues could be a contributing factor.\n9. Medications: Aspirin, clopidogrel, and other medications could contribute to bleeding tendencies or pancytopenia.\n10. Tick-borne Illness: The history of Lyme disease and recent doxycycline administration suggests a possible recurrence or other tick-borne disease such as ehrlichiosis."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Sarimer Sanchez Medicine: A 37-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of a facial droop, dysarthria, and kidney failure. The patient had been well until 1 week before admission, when weakness of the right arm and hand developed, along with difficulty with balance while walking. Two days before admission, the patient was told by family members that his speech sounded slurred while he was speaking on the telephone. On the day of admission, the family members noticed that the patient had new facial asymmetry that had not been present 2 months earlier; in addition, he paused for extended periods of time before answering questions and spoke with slow and slurred speech. The family members brought the patient to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On evaluation, the patient reported malaise and lethargy. He vomited once in the emergency department but reported no nausea or abdominal or flank pain. He had no fever, chills, headache, vision changes, dysuria, hematuria, or urinary frequency or urgency. There was a history of depression, anxiety, and attention defi-cithyperactivity disorder. The patient had used heroin intravenously since he was 16 years of age and frequently missed veins during injections; his last injection was on the morning of this evaluation. On rare occasions, he had used cocaine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, lysergic acid diethylamide, amphetamines, prescription opiates, benzodiazepines, and marijuana. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years and seldom drank alcohol. The patient had previously been homeless, but at the time of this evaluation, he was living alone in an apartment. He was unemployed but had previously worked in international nonprofit consulting. He had never been sexually active. His father, brother, sister, and paternal cousin had substance use disorders; his mother was healthy. The patient took no medications and had no known drug allergies. The temperature was 36.8C, the blood pressure 130/86 mm Hg, the pulse 92 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 26.6. The patient appeared chronically ill, with a flat affect. He was alert and oriented but had difficulty stating the days of the week backward. He was able to follow simple commands after a delay. His speech was slow and dysarthric. There was a facial droop on the right side. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. Strength was 45 in the right arm and 55 in the right leg. Pronator drift was present on the right side. Strength was normal in the left arm and leg. Sensation and deep-tendon reflexes were normal. The Babinski reflex was present in the right foot. Dorsiflexion of the ankles was followed by seven beats of clonus on the right foot and three on the left foot. There was intermittent spontaneous shaking of the right leg in episodes of approximately 10 seconds in duration. Examination of the skin revealed multiple track marks on the arms, with scattered areas of erythematous induration without fluctuance or tenderness. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of liver-function tests were normal, as were results of routine urine and blood toxico-logic screening. The blood level of urea nitrogen was 124 mg per deciliter 44.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter 2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter, creatinine 16.1 mg per deciliter 1423 mol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter 53 to 133 mol per liter, and carbon dioxide 9 mmol per liter reference range, 23 to 32. Four years before this evaluation, the creatinine level had been normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Examination of the urinary sediment revealed granular casts and scattered white cells, with no cellular casts. Tests for antinuclear antibodies, antidouble-stranded DNA antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ANCAs, and rheumatoid factor were negative. Blood levels of C3, C4, lactate dehydrogenase, and gly-cated hemoglobin were normal. Blood samples were obtained for culture. Screening for human immunodeficiency virus HIV type 1 and 2 antibodies and p24 antigen was nonreactive; plasma HIV type 1 RNA was not detected. Tests for hepatitis B virus HBV core IgM, hepatitis C virus HCV antibodies, Treponema pallidum anti-bodies, and Toxoplasma gondii antibodies were negative. An interferon- release assay for Myco-bacterium tuberculosis was negative, and 1,3--d-glucan was not detected on a blood test. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Otto Rapalino: Computed tomography CT of the head Fig. 1A, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed areas of ill-defined hypoattenuation in the deep frontal white matter and striatal region on the left side. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head Fig. 1B through 1F, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed an expansile lesion in the deep gray nuclei and deep white matter on the left side that was associated with signal hyper-intensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging and with increased perfusion on arterial spin labeling imaging. Within the abnormality, there was a 4-mm focus of restricted diffusion in the left globus pallidus and the posterior limb of the left internal capsule. There was associated mass effect with partial effacement of the left lateral ventricle and a rightward midline shift of 7 mm. Dr. Sanchez: Vancomycin, cefepime, and metro-nidazole were administered. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Seven hours after antimicrobial therapy was initiated, a lumbar puncture was performed for cerebrospinal fluid CSF analysis. The opening pressure was 23 cm of water, and the CSF was colorless. The glucose and total protein levels were normal, the total nucleated-cell count was 1 per microliter reference range, 0 to 5, and the red-cell count was 61 per microliter reference range, 0 to 5. Grams staining of the CSF revealed a moderate amount of mononuclear cells, rare polymorpho-nucleocytes, and no organisms. Dr. Rapalino: The next day, renal ultrasonogra-phy Fig. 2 revealed mildly enlarged kidneys right kidney measuring 12.7 cm in length and left kidney 13.5 cm; reference range, 10.1 to 12.81 with normal parenchymal echotexture. The left kidney had multiple simple-appearing cysts, and there was no hydronephrosis. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed splenomegaly but was otherwise unremarkable. Dr. Sanchez: On the third hospital day, comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 66 with no valvular abnormalities; these findings were confirmed on transesophageal echocardiography. During the next 3 days, the patients neurologic deficits did not improve. Fluids containing sodium bicarbonate were administered intravenously; the carbon dioxide level increased to 19 mmol per liter. The creatinine level decreased to 10.5 mg per deciliter 928 mol per liter. No Bence Jones protein was detected in urine. Cultures of blood and CSF samples obtained 72 hours earlier were without growth. On the fourth hospital day, the patient reported more fatigue; there were more errors in his speech, and he was slower to respond to questions. Positron-emission tomography of the skull base to midthighs, performed after the intravenous administration of 18F-fluo-rodeoxyglucose FDG tracer, revealed nonspecific foci of moderate FDG uptake in a multi-nodular goiter but showed no other abnormal FDG uptake. On the sixth hospital day, seizurelike activity was observed. Lorazepam and levetiracetam were administered. On a repeat blood test, the 1,3--d-glucan level was 256 pg per milliliter reference range, 60. A stereotactic biopsy of the lesion involving the left internal capsule was performed with CT guidance, and grossly purulent material was aspirated. Pathological examination revealed debris with abundant neutrophils and fungal hyphae. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "AA amyloidosis complicated by cerebral mucor-mycosis. ", "prediction": "1. Brain abscess: The presence of an expansile lesion in the deep gray nuclei with restricted diffusion and purulent material on biopsy indicates a localized brain infection.\n2. Acute kidney injury secondary to opioid use: The patient’s history of intravenous heroin use and markedly elevated creatinine levels point to possible opioid-induced nephropathy or rhabdomyolysis.\n3. Fungal infection: The detection of fungal hyphae in the biopsy and elevated 1,3-beta-D-glucan levels suggest a systemic or localized fungal infection.\n4. Stroke: The neurologic deficits, including facial droop, dysarthria, and weakness, along with imaging findings of hypoattenuation, could signify an ischemic event.\n5. Toxoplasmosis: Though serologies are negative, the patient's immunocompromised state from substance use raises the possibility of central nervous system involvement.\n6. Tuberculosis: The patient’s chronic illness and immunocompromised state, despite a negative interferon-gamma release assay, make tuberculosis a consideration.\n7. Hepatorenal syndrome: The recent onset of severe renal failure with a history of substance use could indicate hepatic involvement, although liver function tests are normal.\n8. Multiple sclerosis: The neurologic symptoms of imbalance, right-sided weakness, and hyperintense lesions on MRI are consistent with demyelinating disease.\n9. Primary CNS lymphoma: Immunosuppressed individuals are at higher risk, and the expansile lesion could represent a lymphomatous process.\n10. Autoimmune encephalitis: Despite negative autoantibodies, the patient's presentation of neurologic symptoms, including slow responses and dysarthria, require consideration of an autoimmune cause."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Xavier Guell Medicine: A 24-year-old man was transferred to this hospital because of fever, fatigue, cough, and dyspnea. The patient had been well until 5 days before this presentation, when fatigue, malaise, fever, chills, and cough that was productive of terra cottacolored sputum developed. Three days before this presentation, he had presented to an urgent care clinic with nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and diarrhea. A chest radiograph was reportedly normal, and the patient was told he had a viral illness. Intravenous fluids were administered, and he was advised to return to the clinic if symptoms persisted or worsened. The next day, symptoms increased in severity, and the patient was unable to eat or drink owing to persistent nausea and vomiting. Back pain, neck pain, headache, and photophobia developed. The patient reported positional chest pain and dys-pnea, which progressed rapidly, such that he could not walk up a flight of stairs. The day before presentation to this hospital, he presented to another hospital. The temperature was 36.5C, the blood pressure 105/66 mm Hg, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 35 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88 while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. On examination, he appeared unwell and in mild distress. Breath sounds were decreased throughout the upper and lower lung fields, and scattered expiratory wheezes were present. The white-cell count was 21,890 per microliter reference range, 4800 to 10,800, with a neutro-phil count of 45 9851 per microliter; reference range, 37 to 80 1800 to 7700 per microliter and a band count of 23 5035 per microliter; reference range, 5 0 to 1100 per microliter. The platelet count was 60,000 per microliter reference range, 150,000 to 450,000, the creatinine level 1.37 mg per deciliter 121.1 mol per liter; reference range, 0.66 to 1.25 mg per deciliter 58.3 to 110.5 mol per liter, and the lactate level 3.50 mmol per liter 32 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.70 to 2.10 mmol per liter 6.3 to 18.9 mg per deciliter. Nucleic acid test-ing of a nasopharyngeal swab for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus was negative, as was a blood test for heterophile antibodies. Chest radiography revealed diffuse reticu-lonodular interstitial opacities in both lungs. Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, doxycycline, methyl-prednisolone, and intravenous fluids were administered. During the next 3 hours, the oxygen saturation decreased to 80 while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute. Bilevel positive airway pressure was initiated. Dr. Shaunagh McDermott: Computed tomography CT of the chest Fig. 1A through 1C re-vealed ground-glass opacities in both lungs and interlobular septal thickening. Small bilateral pleural effusions were also present. Dr. Guell: The patients family requested that the patient be transferred to this hospital. The patients trachea was intubated in a nonemergency setting; continuous infusions of norepi-nephrine, propofol, and hydromorphone were started. He was transported by medical helicopter to this hospital, arriving approximately 17 hours after his presentation to the first hospital. On the patients arrival at this hospital, additional history was obtained from family members. The patient had been camping in a northern New England forest for 9 days before presentation to the other hospital. Four days before presentation to this hospital, he found an unattached tick on his head, but he had no known tick bites; however, he had many mosquito bites. The patient lived on the mid-Atlantic coast with two cats in a trailer in which mold was reportedly present. He enjoyed outdoor activities such as dirt biking, hiking, boating, rafting, and swimming in fresh water. He worked in carpentry. During a house renovation project approximately 2 weeks before this presentation, he was bitten by a mouse; he did not seek medical attention. The patient had a history of chronic lower back pain. He took no medications and had no known drug allergies. He had smoked cigarettes for 13 years and had quit 1 year earlier. During the past year, the patient used electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and smoked commercial marijuana on a daily basis. His parents and older sibling were alive and well; his grandfather was living with a gastrointestinal cancer. The temperature was 36.3°C, the blood pressure 98//57 mm Hg, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator (positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP], 12 cm of water; tidal volume, 500 ml; fraction of inspired oxygen [Fio2], 1.0; respiratory rate, 15 breaths per minute). The pupils were symmetric and reactive, the lungs were clear on auscultation, and there were no rashes. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Tests for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens in the urine were negative, as were tests of a nasopharyngeal swab for adenovirus, metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza virus antigens. Screening for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 and HIV type 1 p24 antigen was negative. Urinalysis results were normal. Blood cultures were obtained. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. McDermott: A chest radiograph obtained on arrival at this hospital showed diffuse bilateral opacities, with endotracheal and enteric tubes in an appropriate position (Figure 1D). Dr. Guell: Transthoracic echocardiography revealed diffuse hypokinesis of the left ventricle and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45% (reference range, 50 to 75). A lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid was colorless; the total protein level was 31 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55), the glucose level 93 mg per deciliter (5.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), and the nucleated-cell count 1 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5). Gram’s staining revealed few mononuclear cells and no neutrophils or organisms. Dr. Alexandra K. Wong: Flexible bronchoscopy performed on the first hospital day (Figure 2) revealed diffuse erythema and inflammation in the airways, scattered areas of submucosal petechiae and hemorrhage, and scant secretions that were most prominent in the left lung. The bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid was clear and yellow; specimens were obtained for culture. These findings are nonspecific and are often seen with infectious or inflammatory processes, typically accompanied by thrombocytopenia. Dr. Guell: Treatment with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and doxycycline was continued, and gentamicin and furosemide were initiated. A diagnostic test was performed. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. This case was presented at the Medical Case Conference. ", "prediction": "1. Community-acquired pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, chills, productive cough, dyspnea, and diffuse bilateral opacities on chest radiographs are consistent with community-acquired pneumonia.\n2. Viral pneumonia: Despite negative initial tests for common respiratory viruses, the patient's systemic symptoms and ground-glass opacities on CT scans suggest a viral etiology.\n3. Legionnaires' disease: Although initial rapid tests for Legionella were negative, the patient's exposure history and severe pneumonia-like presentation necessitate consideration of this infection.\n4. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome: The patient's camping history in a forested area and exposure to a mouse bite with subsequent severe respiratory symptoms aligns with hantavirus infection.\n5. Lyme disease: The presence of an unattached tick before symptom onset and the patient's outdoor activities in an endemic area make Lyme disease a possibility, despite the absence of a rash.\n6. Histoplasmosis: The patient’s history of exposure to potential mold and living conditions, coupled with systemic and pulmonary symptoms, could suggest histoplasmosis.\n7. Psittacosis: The patient's respiratory symptoms and history of exposure to birds or bird environments, possibly through his work or outdoor activities, may point to psittacosis.\n8. Acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis: Given the patient's history of mold exposure at home and his systemic symptoms with diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, hypersensitivity pneumonitis is a consideration.\n9. E-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury (EVALI): The patient's history of daily e-cigarette use and marijuana smoking aligns closely with EVALI, characterized by respiratory distress and ground-glass opacities.\n10.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Sahir Kalim: A 29-year-old white man was evaluated at the nephrology clinic of this hospital because of hypertension, renal insufficiency, and hematuria. Eight months before the current evaluation, at a physical examination performed for employment, the patient was told he had high blood pressure; no further evaluation was performed. One month before the current evaluation, he was seen by his primary care physician at another institution for a routine physical examination. A review of systems was reportedly negative. The temperature was 36.3C, the heart rate 67 beats per minute, the blood pressure 1751/00 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99 while he was breathing ambient air. Examination of the skin revealed a rash consistent with rosacea and a small cyst on the back; the remainder of the examination was normal. The blood level of hemoglobin was 10.7 g per deciliter normal range, 14.0 to 18.0, hematocrit 31.5 normal range, 40.0 to 54.0, urea nitrogen 37 mg per deciliter 13.2 mmol per liter; normal range, 9 to 20 mg per deciliter 3.2 to 7.1 mmol per liter, creatinine 3.1 mg per deciliter 274 mol per liter; normal range, 0.7 to 1.3 mg per deciliter 62 to 115 mol per liter, potassium 4.5 mmol per liter normal range, 3.5 to 5.1, albumin 3.7 g per deciliter normal range, 3.3 to 5.0, and glucose 86 mg per deciliter 4.8 mmol per liter; normal range, 70 to 99 mg per deciliter 3.9 to 5.5 mmol per liter. A screening test for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 was negative. Amlodipine therapy was started. Six days later, dark urine developed. After 4 days, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. He reported no dysuria, urinary frequency, obstructive urinary symptoms, antecedent trauma, or vigorous exercise. Examination was notable for a blood pressure of 1481/00 mm Hg. The blood level of urea nitrogen was 46 mg per deciliter 16.4 mmol per liter, creatinine 3.5 mg per deciliter 309 mol per liter, and potassium 5.7 mmol per liter. Other laboratory test results were essentially unchanged from 10 days earlier. A urinalysis was notable for yellow, cloudy urine, with 3 blood normal value, negative, 3 protein normal value, negative, 0 to 5 erythrocytes per high-power field normal range, 5, and 10 to 20 leukocytes per high-power field normal range, 2. Urine was obtained for culture. The dose of amlodipine was increased. The patient was referred to the outpatient nephrology clinic of this hospital. At this hospital, the patient reported that he had had intermittent hematuria and episodic foamy urine during the previous 10 months. He had new pedal edema that was greater on the right side than on the left side. Since the last visit with his primary care physician approximately 2 weeks earlier, he had had 2 days of coryza but no other respiratory symptoms. There was no anorexia, weight change, pruritus, abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, chest pain, dyspnea, wheezing, cough, hemoptysis, visual or auditory disturbances, headache, neu-rologic symptoms, or other bleeding symptoms. The medical history was notable for rosacea and childhood asthma. Medications included amlo-dipine. There were no known adverse reactions to medications. The patient was in a long-term monogamous relationship. He worked in maintenance but had not been exposed to inhaled chemicals or environmental allergens. He had not traveled outside Massachusetts. He drank three beers per week and had last smoked marijuana 10 years earlier; he had never used tobacco or other illicit drugs. There was a history of systemic hypertension in his paternal grandfather and a paternal aunt, as well as a history of cancer in multiple maternal relatives, including his mother, who had had brain cancer, and his maternal grandmother and a maternal aunt, who had had breast cancer. There was no known family history of kidney disease. The temperature was 36.9C, the heart rate 71 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 1601/02 mm Hg. The weight was 89 kg, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 27.2. There was 1 pedal edema. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of liver-function tests, blood levels of creatine kinase and glycated hemoglobin, the international normalized ratio, and the prothrom-bin time were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Tests for hepatitis B surface antigens and surface antibodies, hepatitis C antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, and antidouble-stranded DNA antibodies were negative. Examination of urine sediment revealed fine granular casts, dysmorphic red cells, and rare white-cell casts. Dr. Amirkasra Mojtahed: On renal ultrasonogra-phy, the kidneys were normal in size. There was increased bilateral renal parenchymal echo-genicity and no evidence of hydronephrosis Fig. 1. Dr. Kalim: Amlodipine was stopped, and la-betalol was started.

IgA Nephropathy (Berger's Disease): Considering the patient's intermittent hematuria, renal insufficiency, and the presence of dysmorphic red cells in the urine sediment, IgA nephropathy is highly probable.\n2. Chronic Glomerulonephritis: The combination of hematuria, proteinuria, elevated creatinine, and hypertension is suggestive of chronic glomerulonephritis.\n3. Alport Syndrome: Given the patient’s age, renal insufficiency, hematuria, and family history of systemic hypertension, Alport syndrome should be considered.\n4. Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis: The patient's recent coryza and significant laboratory findings could be related to a post-infectious glomerulonephritis.\n5. Lupus Nephritis: Despite negative antinuclear and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, lupus nephritis remains a differential given the renal and systemic findings.\n6. Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis (MPGN): Hematuria, proteinuria, and the presence of granular casts could indicate MPGN.\n7. Hypertensive Nephrosclerosis: Chronic hypertension and renal insufficiency may be suggestive of hypertensive nephrosclerosis.\n8. Acute Interstitial Nephritis: The temporal relationship between starting amlodipine and the development of dark urine with elevated creatinine suggests drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis.\n9. Thin Basement Membrane Disease: Known for causing hematuria without significant proteinuria or renal insufficiency, it should be considered especially without any positive family history of kidney disease. \n10. Polycystic Kidney Disease: Though the ultrasound showed normal-sized kidneys, early-stage autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease should be considered due to hematuria and family history of systemic hypertension."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. John H. Stone: A 37-year-old man was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital for joint pain and rash. The patient had been well until 2 years before this evaluation, when intermittent arthralgias developed in the joints of the hands. Four months before presentation, the pain in the hands became more severe, and new joint pain developed in the wrists, knees, ankles, and shoulders. He had occasional joint stiffness, most commonly in the morning. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. The blood levels of electrolytes were reportedly normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests, the complete blood count, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A screening test for Lyme disease was reportedly negative. Despite the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, the joint arthralgias did not abate, and the patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation. In the rheumatology clinic, the patient reported the new development of a rash on his hands and feet, as well as pain in his calves that worsened after prolonged standing. He had no fever, chills, night sweats, weakness, chest pain, or shortness of breath. On examination, several small, nonblanching, petechial lesions were noted on the hands and feet, and four slightly raised, erythematous lesions were seen on the hands and left lower leg. He had tenderness in the wrists, metacarpo-phalangeal joints, ankles, and metatarsophalangeal joints, as well as pain with motion of the hips and knees. The muscles of the calves were firm and tender on palpation. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. The complete blood count and differential count were normal. Blood tests for rheumatoid factor and anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were negative. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 77 mm per hour reference range, 0 to 11, and the C-reactive protein level was 58 mg per liter reference value, 8. Blood tests were positive for antinuclear antibodies at titers of 1:40 and 1:160, with a speckled pattern. Hydroxychloroquine and prednisone were prescribed. However, during the next week, the patient had difficulty walking owing to progressively worsening calf pain, and he presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported dry mouth and weight loss of 9 kg over a period of 2 months that he attributed to changes in diet and exercise. Two days before presentation, he had noted redness and mild pain in both eyes but no blurred vision. Five days before presentation, his temperature measured at home had been 37.9C. His medical history included irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, and gastro-esophageal reflux disease, which had resulted in a stricture that required balloon dilation of the distal esophagus. Twenty-two months before this presentation, mild elevations in alanine amino-transferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels detected during routine laboratory testing had been attributed to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. He had had multiple previous tick bites and had been treated empirically with doxycycline in the past, most recently 14 months before presentation. Medications were hydroxychloroquine, pred-nisone, omeprazole, ergocalciferol, alprazolam, a multivitamin, and glucosamine. The patient did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs; he drank alcohol occasionally. He was married with two children and lived in a suburb of Boston. He worked as an executive in a local firm. There was no family history of autoimmune disease, including rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. On examination, the temperature was 36.3C, the blood pressure 146/88 mm Hg, the pulse 89 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. Diffuse conjunctival injection affecting the epi-scleral vessels was present in both eyes, and a violaceous hue was noted in the underlying sclera Fig. 1A. The patient was able to stand from a seated position without the use of his hands, but ambulation was difficult because of pain in the calves. The calves appeared swollen, without erythema or warmth, and were firm and tender on palpation. There was pain on flexion and extension of the right great toe, with no erythema, warmth, or swelling of the joints. Erythematous papules were present on the left wrist, the left olecranon Fig. 1B, and the right olecranon. Several erythematous lesions were noted on the left lower leg and right foot Fig. 1C and 1D and on the hands; they were not raised and did not blanch with pressure. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests. Urinalysis revealed 2 blood reference value, negative, 1 protein reference value, negative, 50 to 100 red cells per high-power field reference range, 0 to 2, and 5 to 10 white cells per high-power field reference range, 0 to 2. Examination of the urine sediment revealed dysmorphic red cells and red-cell casts that were too numerous to count. Blood tests for antidouble-stranded DNA antibody, anti-Ro antibody, and anti-La antibody were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies of the left leg were obtained. Dr. Ambrose J. Huang: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the left lower leg Fig. 2, performed before and after the administration of intravenous gadolinium-based contrast material, revealed nonspecific, diffuse muscle edema, which was most prominent in the posterior compartment of the calf, with mild associated contrast enhancement. There was no evidence of muscle atrophy, myonecrosis, bony involvement, or drainable fluid collections. Dr. Stone: The patient was admitted to the hospital, and a diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Proteinase 3 antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody– associated vasculitis consistent with granuloma-tosis with polyangiitis. ", "prediction": "1. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE): Despite negative anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, the positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) with a speckled pattern, multisystem involvement, and elevated inflammatory markers are suggestive of SLE.\n2. Dermatomyositis: The presence of muscle pain with tenderness, elevated inflammatory markers, skin rash, and MRI findings of muscle edema are compatible with dermatomyositis.\n3. Sjögren's Syndrome: The patient's dry mouth, positive ANA, elevated inflammatory markers, and the association of a collagen vascular disorder raise the possibility of Sjögren's syndrome.\n4. Vasculitis: The petechial rash, erythematous lesions, elevated ESR, and presence of dysmorphic red cells and casts in the urine sediment are compatible with a small-to-medium vessel vasculitis.\n5. Myositis: The combination of calf pain, muscle tenderness, and MRI findings of muscle edema with elevated inflammation markers supports a diagnosis of myositis.\n6. Antiphospholipid Syndrome: The patient’s history of miscarriages, weight loss, and positive ANA raise the possibility of antiphospholipid syndrome, despite the lack of typical antibodies.\n7. Sarcoidosis: The presence of erythematous lesions, conjunctival injection, and systemic symptoms such as weight loss with elevated markers of inflammation could suggest sarcoidosis.\n8. Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD): The positive ANA, multisystem involvement, and absence of highly specific antibodies can indicate MCTD.\n9. Inflammatory Arthritis: Despite negative rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP, the chronic joint pain, swelling, and elevated CRP and ESR could be indicative of an inflammatory arthritis.\n10. Infective Endocarditis: The constitutional symptoms, presence of petechial skin lesions, and urinalysis findings could suggest an underlying infective endocarditis, especially in a patient with a history of tick bites."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Joseph A. Rosenthal Medicine: A 79-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of hyponatremia and involuntary movements of the arm and face. The patient had been in his usual state of health and walking 3 miles per day until 5 weeks before the current admission, when fatigue developed. During his daily walks, he began resting after walking a quarter mile because of fatigue; there was no chest pain, dyspnea, or leg pain. In addition, he began taking naps during the day, which was unusual for him. Three weeks before the current admission, the patient presented to his primary care provider for evaluation. Laboratory studies reportedly revealed hyponatremia. He was advised to present to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. In the emergency department, the patient reported no history of orthopnea or leg swelling, although his weight had increased by 2.2 kg during the past year. He reported eating and drinking normally, with no nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. He had no weakness, loss of sensation, headache, or vision changes. Other medical history was notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Medications included lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and atorvastatin; there were no known allergies to medications. He had smoked tobacco in the past but had quit 40 years earlier; he drank alcohol rarely and did not use illicit drugs. He was a retired teacher and lived with his wife in New England. His family history included heart disease in his father and pancreatic cancer in his mother. The temperature was 36.8C, the blood pressure 156/76 mm Hg, the pulse 56 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 74.8 kg, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 24.4. The physical examination was normal. The blood sodium level was 123 mmol per liter reference range, 135 to 145; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient received 250 ml of intravenous isotonic fluids. Four hours later, the blood sodium level was 127 mmol per liter. The patient was instructed to stop taking hydrochlo-rothiazide and to follow up with his primary care physician; he was discharged from the emergency department. After the patient returned home, his fatigue diminished. One week later, involuntary movements in the left arm and hand developed. The patient described the movements as spasms that caused the arm to flex at the elbow or wrist. The episodes lasted less than 5 seconds and occurred multiple times per day. They often occurred after position changes or sudden movements and often caused him to drop any object he was holding in his left hand. He described feeling a strange sensation immediately before the movements but being unable to suppress them. The patients wife had noticed that occasionally during the involuntary movements of the left arm and hand, the left side of the patients face pulled to the side as though he were grimacing. The episodes increased in frequency during the next 2 weeks, and 3 weeks after discharge from the emergency department, the patient returned to this hospital for additional evaluation. On evaluation, the patellar reflexes were 3; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. The blood sodium level was 123 mmol per liter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood levels of thyrotropin and N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide were normal. The blood cortisol level was 13.5 g per deciliter; 30 minutes after the administration of 250 g of cosyntropin, the blood cortisol level was 27.9 g per deciliter. The patient received 1 liter of intravenous isotonic fluids. Computed tomography CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed mild, scattered, nonspecific hypoattenua-tion of the periventricular and subcortical white matter bilaterally. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. Ten hours later, the blood sodium level was 121 mmol per liter. The patient was asked to limit his intake of water to less than 1 liter per day, and sodium chloride tablets were administered. Twelve hours later, the blood sodium level was 123 mmol per liter. A single, unwitnessed episode of involuntary movement of the left arm and left side of the face occurred. On the second and third hospital days, intravenous desmopressin and hypertonic fluids were administered, and the blood sodium level gradually increased to 132 mmol per liter. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head was performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material; T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed mild, scattered hyperintensities in the periventricular and sub-cortical white matter. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material; the scan showed a small cluster of nodules and linear opacities in the right middle lobe and multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine and bilateral hip joints. On the fourth hospital day, the administration of intravenous hypertonic fluids and desmo-pressin was stopped, oral furosemide was added, and sodium chloride tablets were continued. Over the next 3 days, the blood sodium level increased to 137 mmol per liter. The patient was discharged home on the seventh hospital day having had no additional episodes of involuntary movements. The blood sodium level was normal 2 days after discharge and again 8 days after discharge. The patient was instructed to drink water when he was thirsty without limiting his daily intake. Two weeks after discharge, the patient noticed recurrence of the involuntary movements of the left arm and left side of the face. He was evaluated by his primary care physician. The physical examination was normal, and no involuntary movements were observed. The blood sodium level was 134 mmol per liter. The patient was instructed to limit his intake of water to 2 liters per day. Four weeks after discharge, the patient was evaluated in the nephrology clinic of this hospital. He reported that the involuntary movements of the left arm and left side of the face had increased in frequency, occurring once per hour. The blood sodium level was 134 mmol per liter. He was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation. At the neurology clinic, a diagnostic test was performed, and a diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "LGI1 autoimmune encephalitis. ", "prediction": "1. Essential Tremor: The patient's description of involuntary movements that increase with activity and position changes is consistent with essential tremor, a common movement disorder in the elderly.\n2. Focal Seizures: The episodes of involuntary movements and the sensation preceding them suggest focal seizures, which can present with motor disturbances and sensory changes.\n3. Hyponatremia-induced encephalopathy: Persistent hyponatremia can lead to encephalopathy, which might manifest as altered mental status and involuntary movements.\n4. Huntington's Disease: Although less likely due to the age of onset, the combination of involuntary movements and changes in mental function raises the possibility of Huntington's disease.\n5. Parkinson's Disease: The age of the patient and the presence of tremor-like involuntary movements may indicate Parkinson's disease, which can present with resting tremors.\n6. Drug-induced Parkinsonism: The patient’s medication history, particularly with hydrochlorothiazide, raises the potential for drug-induced parkinsonism, causing tremors and involuntary movements.\n7. Wilson's Disease: Though rare and usually presenting earlier, involuntary movements in conjunction with liver disease markers may suggest Wilson's disease, which must be ruled out.\n8. Vascular Parkinsonism: Given the CT and MRI findings of white matter hyperintensities, vascular parkinsonism could explain the motor symptoms due to cerebrovascular changes.\n9. Serotonin Syndrome: The cluster of symptoms might result from a drug interaction, notably if there's unreported self-administration of serotonergic agents.\n10. Structural Brain Lesion: The mild hyperintensities noticed on MRI could indicate a slow-growing or subtle lesion (e.g., meningioma, metastasis) that warrants further investigation given the patient’s steps in evaluation."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Lila M. Martin: A 73-year-old man was transferred to the intensive care unit ICU of an academic health center in Boston for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in March 2020, during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 6 days before this transfer, when a dry cough, fever, and worsening fatigue developed. Two days later, his symptoms had not resolved, and he presented to the emergency department at a local hospital. The temperature was 38.8C, the blood pressure 94/62 mm Hg, the heart rate 91 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while he was breathing ambient air. On examination, he appeared well, and the lung sounds were clear. The white-cell count was 5600 per microliter reference range, 4800 to 10,500; 56 of the cells were neutrophils and 33 were lymphocytes. A nasopharyngeal swab was submitted to the Massachusetts State Laboratory for nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Tests for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus were not performed owing to a statewide shortage of nasopharyngeal swabs. Dr. Diana Litmanovich: Computed tomography CT of the chest, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed small 1 to 1.5 cm in diameter, rounded central and peripheral ground-glass opacities in both lungs Fig. 1A. Dr. Martin: Oseltamivir was prescribed for the empirical treatment of influenza, and the patient was discharged from the emergency department and instructed to self-quarantine at home. During the next 4 days, his symptoms persisted; when dyspnea developed, he contacted his primary care physician and was referred back to the emergency department at the local hospital. The temperature was 38.6C, the blood pressure 158/91 mm Hg, the heart rate 108 beats per minute, the re-spiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 90 while he was breathing ambient air. He appeared fatigued, tachypneic, and distressed; auscultation of the lungs revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally. The trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Intravenous propofol, cisa-tracurium, cefepime, and norepinephrine were administered, and the patient was transferred by helicopter to an academic health center in Boston for further evaluation and management of symptoms. On the patients arrival at the academic health center, his family was available to provide information regarding medical history, surgical history, and a recent review of systems by telephone. The review of systems was negative for conjunctivitis, nasal congestion, sinusitis, anosmia, abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, light-headedness, dizziness, chest pain, and edema. The patients status with respect to influenza and pneumococcal vaccination was unknown. His medical history was notable for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and obstructive sleep apnea, for which nightly continuous positive airway pressure had been prescribed. He had undergone surgical aortic-valve replacement for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis 1 year earlier; there had been no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease on preoperative angiography. Radiofrequency ablation for recurrent atrial flutter had been performed 2 years earlier, and he had undergone right shoulder arthroplasty. Medications included metformin, insulin lispro, atenolol, losartan, and apixaban. Multiple statin medications had previously caused myalgia with elevated creatine kinase levels. The patient was a health care worker but had no known sick contacts. No family members were ill. He had not traveled recently or had other environmental exposures. He did not use tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit substances. His family history was notable for coronary artery disease in multiple relatives; there was no history of pulmonary disease. The patient was admitted to a dedicated Covid-19 ICU at the academic health center. The temperature was 38.9C, the blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg while he was receiving intravenous norepinephrine, the heart rate 112 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 25 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95 while he was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator positive end-expiratory pressure, 5 cm of water; tidal volume, 410 ml; fraction of inspired oxygen, 1.0. The patient was sedated. There was no jugular venous distention. Auscultation of the chest revealed a tachycardic rhythm with no murmur and coarse breath sounds with rhonchi in both lungs. His arms and legs were cool and clammy. The remainder of the examination was normal. Catheters were placed in the right internal jugular vein and the left radial artery. The central venous pressure was 4 mm Hg. The partial-thromboplastin time and blood levels of phosphorus and magnesium were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A blood sample was obtained for culture, and a nasopha-ryngeal swab was obtained for nucleic acid testing for the detection of community-acquired respiratory pathogens and SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Dr. Litmanovich: An anteroposterior radiograph of the chest Fig. 1B showed extensive confluent central and peripheral parenchymal opacities in both lungs. The central venous catheter in the right internal jugular vein was in an appropriate position. Dr. Martin: An electrocardiogram Fig. 2A showed normal sinus rhythm with left atrial abnormality, a borderline prolonged PR interval, ST-segment depressions of 1 mm in the inferior leads, ST-segment elevations of 1 mm in leads I and aVL, PR-segment deviations a depression in lead II and an elevation in lead aVR, and a corrected QT QTc interval of 425 msec. A trans-thoracic echocardiogram showed severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, as well as dysfunction of the right ventricular free wall and the apex see Videos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. These findings were new relative to an echocardiogram that had been obtained 2 months earlier as part of routine surveillance after aortic-valve replacement, that had shown normal biventricular function. The size of the left ventricular chamber was normal. There was mild symmetric thickening of the left ventricular wall 12 mm; normal thickness, 11, a finding that was unchanged from the previous echocardiogram. No evidence of pericardial effusion was observed, and the bioprosthetic aortic valve was well seated and appeared to be functioning normally. The patient received intravenous propofol, fentanyl, midazolam, and cisatracurium, as well as empirical intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and doxycycline. Treatment with apixaban was discontinued, and intravenous heparin was initiated. Hydroxychloroquine was administered en-terally. Additional management decisions were made.

Zlotoff: A 44-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of shortness of breath and chest pain. Eight days before admission  and 3 days after her husband had begun to have fatigue, a nonproductive cough, and a fever  the patient started to have chills, a sore throat, a nonproductive cough, and myalgias. After 2 days of progressive symptoms, she contacted her primary care physician. A telemedicine visit was arranged as part of a local public health strategy to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2, during the pandemic. The patient reported that she had rib soreness with coughing, as well as a temperature of 35.3C. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 was suspected. Rest, isolation measures to reduce viral transmission, and increased oral intake of fluid were recommended, along with acetaminophen and dextromethorphanguaifenesin as needed. Three days later, she had diarrhea and back pain, but the coughing had become less frequent. During a follow-up tele-medicine visit, the primary care physician recommended that the patient take acetaminophen as needed for back pain and counseled her to seek in-person medical evaluation if symptoms worsened. Three days later, the patient started to have chest pain that was different from the rib soreness with coughing; the chest pain was present at rest and was accompanied by new dyspnea. She called emergency medical services. On the initial evaluation, the heart rate was 116 beats per minute, the systolic blood pressure 110 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was brought by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival, the patient reported feeling weak, light-headed, and feverish, with chills. She reported that the chest discomfort felt like pressure, was primarily located in the anterior chest, and was mild in intensity but worsened with deep inspiration or coughing. She also reported nausea and a few episodes of nonbloody diarrhea. She had received an influenza vaccine 6 months earlier. The patients medical history was notable for gastroesophageal reflux disease with histologic evidence of intestinal metaplasia of the esophagus, chronic abdominal bloating and constipation, mild obstructive sleep apnea, subclinical hyperthyroidism, uterine cysts, and depression. Medications included trazodone and acetaminophen as needed. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was born in Central America and had immigrated to the United States approximately 20 years earlier. She lived in New England with her husband and teenage children. She worked as a custodian but had no known exposure to dust, allergens, or solvents. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had had hypertension and a myocardial infarction; her father had died of genitourinary cancer, and multiple paternal relatives had a history of cancer. On examination, the temperature was 36.4C, the heart rate 103 beats per minute, the blood pressure 79/51 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 23.7. The patient appeared pale and slightly diaphoretic. She was able to speak in full sentences but appeared lethargic. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The heart was tachycardic, with normal first and second heart sounds S1 and S2 and no gallops S3  or S4. There was mild, diffuse abdominal tenderness on palpation. The legs were cool to the touch. The remainder of the examination was normal. Lactated Ringers solution was administered intravenously. Dr. Judy Hung: Point-of-care cardiac ultrasonog-raphy revealed severely depressed left ventricular function. The left ventricular wall thickness was normal; the left ventricular cavity was mildly dilated Fig. 1A; also see Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. A trace pericardial effusion was visible. Dr. Zlotoff: On blood testing, human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable. Blood levels of magnesium, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and free thyroxine were normal, as were the pro-thrombin time, international normalized ratio, and partial-thromboplastin time; other test results are shown in Table 1. A nasopharyngeal swab was obtained for testing, and blood was obtained for culture. Intravenous vancomycin and cefepime were administered. Electrocardiography ECG showed sinus rhythm at 96 beats per minute, submillimeter ST-segment elevation in leads I and aVL, and low QRS voltage Fig. 1B. Results of chest radiography were normal Fig. 1C. One hour after the administration of intravenous fluids and antibiotic agents, hypotension persisted and treatment with intravenous norepi-nephrine was initiated. The patient had a brief episode of unresponsiveness in the context of worsened hypotension, and intravenous dobuta-mine was added. Repeat bedside cardiac ultraso-nography revealed severe left ventricular dysfunction, a small anterior pericardial effusion, and a dilated inferior vena cava without respiro-phasic variation; the left ventricular wall thickness was normal. Dr. Andrey Rupasov: Computed tomographic CT angiography of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Images of the heart and great vessels showed excellent opacification of the right side of the heart and pulmonary arteries but poor opacification of the left side of the heart and aorta due to prolongation of the pulmonary circulation time, which is suggestive of cardiac dysfunction Fig. 1D. Radiographically significant coronary-artery calcification was absent. Images of the lungs showed a few scattered, predominantly peripheral ground-glass opacities in the lingula, the right middle lobe, and both lower lobes Fig. 1E, as well as a trace pleural effusion. Although the pulmonary findings are nonspecific, they are suggestive of inflammation or infection that, in this clinical context, is likely to be due to SARS-CoV-2. Because the patient had abdominal tenderness and hypotension, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was also obtained; the images showed a small amount of ascites and periportal edema, findings that are indicative of elevated central venous pressure. Dr. Zlotoff: Three hours after the initial presentation, the patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit ICU. She was lethargic and reported nausea. The temperature was 36.4C, the heart rate 121 beats per minute, the blood pressure 99/79 mm Hg while she was receiving norepinephrine and dobutamine, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen satu-ration 98 while she was breathing ambient air. The arms and legs were cool. Specialists in heart failure, critical care, and cardiac surgery were consulted. During the next 4 hours, catheters were placed in the radial artery and in the pulmonary artery through the right internal jugular vein. Arterial blood gas measurements, obtained while the patient was breathing ambient air, were notable for a pH of 7.45, a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 20 mm Hg, and a partial pressure of oxygen of 103 mm Hg. The central venous pressure was 21 mm Hg, the pulmonary arterial pressure 37/19 mm Hg, the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 25 mm Hg, and the thermodilution cardiac output 2.2 liters per minute. The dose of dobutamine was increased. Testing of the naso-pharyngeal swab was negative for influenza A and B virus and respiratory syncytial virus DNA but was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. During the next 3 hours, the patient remained lethargic, with light-headedness, nausea, and one episode of nonbloody emesis. The temperature increased to 37.9C, the heart rate to 140 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate to 31 breaths per minute; the blood pressure was labile, with intermittent episodes of a systolic blood pressure lower than 70 mm Hg despite treatment with norepinephrine and dobutamine. The trachea was intubated and mechanical ventilation was initiated to reduce cardiopulmonary metabolic demands. Intravenous vasopressin and milrinone were added. The heart rate remained higher than 140 beats per minute, the systolic blood pressure remained lower than 70 mm Hg, and the ther-modilution cardiac output was 1.7 liters per minute. Oliguria developed. Additional laboratory studies were obtained Table 1. Urgent management decisions were made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "SARS-CoV-2 infection complicated by severe acute inflammatory cardiomyopathy and cardiogenic shock. ", "prediction": "1. COVID-19 myocarditis: The patient exhibits severe left ventricular dysfunction, hypotension, and a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, suggesting myocarditis secondary to COVID-19 infection.\n\n2. Cardiogenic shock: Clinical evidence of severe left ventricular dysfunction, low cardiac output, and high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure support a diagnosis of cardiogenic shock.\n\n3. COVID-19 pneumonia: The presence of ground-glass opacities in the lungs and a positive SARS-CoV-2 test suggests COVID-19 pneumonia contributing to respiratory symptoms.\n\n4. Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy: Persistent hypotension, high lactate levels, and organ dysfunction in the setting of a possible infection could indicate sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy.\n\n5. Acute viral pericarditis: Given the trace pericardial effusion and clinical context of viral illness, acute viral pericarditis is a possibility.\n\n6. Toxic shock syndrome: Hypotension, fever, and multiorgan failure could suggest toxic shock syndrome, although less likely without the presence of an evident toxin source.\n\n7. Pulmonary embolism: Despite a negative CT angiography, the patient's symptoms and initial presentation sometimes necessitate reconsidering pulmonary embolism, particularly if smaller emboli were undetected.\n\n8. Stress-induced cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo): Acute stress from COVID-19 infection and ICU admission could lead to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, although less likely in the presence of inflammatory markers and viral symptoms.\n\n9. Acute gastrointestinal infection: The presence of diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal tenderness might suggest an acute gastrointestinal infection that could secondary affect cardiac function.\n\n10.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Jacqueline B. Henson Medicine: A 54-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital after cardiac arrest associated with ventricular fibrillation. The patient had been in his usual state of health until midday on the day of admission, when he was in a fast-food restaurant and gasped suddenly, with full-body shaking and loss of consciousness. The shaking movements ceased quickly, but he remained unresponsive. Emergency medical services personnel arrived after approximately 4 minutes, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR was initiated. The heart rhythm was identified as ventricular fibrillation; four shocks were delivered, and the patient received intravenous naloxone, amiodarone, and a bolus of epinephrine followed by a continuous infusion. A slow, wide-complex heart rhythm with a rate of 40 beats per minute was noted, reportedly with concurrent return of mental status, but CPR had to be resumed after pulselessness recurred. The patient arrived at this hospital 30 minutes after the initial arrest. The patient was an unresponsive, middle-aged man who had undergone mechanical CPR and had no external signs of trauma. Empirical intravenous calcium chloride, dextrose and insulin, and sodium bicarbonate were administered. In addition, vaso-pressin, norepinephrine, rocuronium, and ketamine were administered intravenously, and aspirin was administered rectally. Emergency intubation of the trachea was performed, and an orogastric tube, a femoral arterial catheter, and a femoral central venous catheter were placed. Dr. Neel M. Butala: An electrocardiogram ECG Fig. 1A showed uncertain atrial activity; a regular accelerated idioventricular rhythm at a rate of 70 beats per minute, with a very wide QRS complex and multifocal premature ventricular contractions; possible elevations of the ST segment in leads aVR, aVL, and V1; and the presence of U waves. Dr. Henson: Initial laboratory test results obtained 25 minutes after the patient arrived at this hospital are shown in Table 1. Cardiac ultrasound images obtained at the bedside showed marked global left ventricular dysfunction. Spontaneous circulation was restored; the heart rate was 108 beats per minute and the blood pressure 139/92 mm Hg while the patient was receiving intravenous epinephrine and nor-epinephrine. A repeat ECG Fig. 1B showed findings similar to those seen on presentation. The neurology service was consulted. A repeat examination, performed after the medications used for sedation were discontinued, revealed anisocoria and sluggishly reactive pupils the left was 7 mm in diameter, and the right was 5 mm; corneal reflexes and response to noxious stimuli were absent. Therapeutic hypothermia was not initiated. Dr. Laura L. Avery: Computed tomography of the head Fig. 1C, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed preservation of differentiation between gray and white matter, without evidence of territorial infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, or mass lesions. Dr. Butala: The patient was transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where a trans-aortic percutaneous ventricular assist device was placed through the femoral artery, and thereafter, the patient was weaned from epinephrine and norepinephrine. Coronary angiography Fig. 1D and 1E revealed only minimal luminal irregularities see Videos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Subsequent catheterization of the right and left sides of the heart revealed a right atrial pressure of 13 mm Hg, a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 27 mm Hg, and a left ventricular end-diastolic pres-sure of 30 mm Hg. The pulmonary arterial oxygen saturation was 85. Dr. Henson: Additional laboratory test results returned during the catheterization procedure Table 1 were notable for a blood potassium level of 2.0 mmol per liter normal range, 3.4 to 5.0. The patient received 60 mmol of enteral potassium chloride and 80 mmol of intravenous potassium chloride. Three hours after the patient arrived at this hospital, he was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit ICU, whereupon limited additional history was available from family and friends. There was no history of chest pain, dyspnea, or symptoms of heart failure or dysrhythmia. He had a poor diet, consisting primarily of several packages of candy daily; 3 weeks earlier, he had switched the type of candy he was eating. He had no sick contacts, fever or chills, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Medical history included previous heroin use disorder and untreated hepatitis C virus infection. The patient had never had any adverse drug reactions. He worked in construction. He did not drink alcohol, he smoked one pack of cigarettes daily and had done so for 36 years, and he had reportedly been abstinent from opiates for the previous 3 years. There was no family history of cardiac, respiratory, renal, neurologic, or endocrine disease. The temperature was 34.0C, the heart rate 119 beats per minute, the blood pressure 81/53 mm Hg on the percutaneous ventricular assist device, and the oxygen saturation 95 while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.50; respiratory rate, 24 breaths per minute; positive end-expiratory pressure, 5 cm of water; tidal volume, 450 ml. On examination, he was unresponsive; the pupils remained sluggishly reactive and asymmetric. No cough or gag was noted, and corneal reflexes remained absent. There were no lacerations on the tongue. The heart rhythm was tachycardic and intermittently irregular, but no murmur was noted. The skin was warm, without rashes or bruises. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. The blood levels of thyrotropin, free thyroxine, amylase, lipase, and carboxyhemoglobin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Potassium chloride at a dose of 40 mmol was administered intravenously. Dr. Butala: An ECG Fig. 2A showed sinus tachycardia with alternating left anterior fascicu-lar block and left bundle-branch block, as well as corrected QT QTc prolongation. Dr. Avery: A chest radiograph Fig. 2B showed clear lungs, with no evidence of pneumothorax, and a normal-sized cardiac silhouette. The endo-tracheal tube, pulmonary-artery catheter, and percutaneous ventricular assist device were all appropriately positioned. Dr. Butala: Transthoracic echocardiography Fig. 2C showed normal left ventricular size but severe biventricular dysfunction, which was new relative to an outpatient study obtained 16 months earlier that had shown normal biventricular function. The percutaneous ventricular assist device was confirmed to be in an appropriate position, and there was no evidence of pericardial effusion see Video 3. Dr. Henson: Intravenous clevidipine was administered for elevated blood pressure. Telemetric monitoring showed frequent ventricular couplets and triplets, as well as runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Amiodarone was infused intravenously. Additional arterial blood gas measurements were obtained 2 hours after the patient arrived at the ICU Table 1, and the patient received 60 mmol of intravenous potassium chloride, followed by an additional 40 mmol of intravenous potassium chloride 2 hours later. Dr. Butala: A repeat ECG Fig. 2D showed sinus tachycardia with a normal QRS duration, ventricular ectopic beat, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities, U waves, and QTc prolongation. Dr. Henson: Four hours later, an additional 40 mmol of intravenous potassium chloride was administered after more test results were received. The patients family provided additional history, and a diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Pseudohyperaldosteronism suggestive of excessive licorice consumption complicated by cardiac arrest associated with ventricular fibrillation. ", "prediction": "1. Hypokalemia: Severe hypokalemia (potassium level of 2.0 mmol per liter) is a common cause of ventricular fibrillation and marked global left ventricular dysfunction seen in this patient.\n2. Primary Ventricular Fibrillation: The sudden onset of ventricular fibrillation in a previously healthy individual suggests a primary arrhythmic event.\n3. Acute Severe Myocarditis: The severe biventricular dysfunction on echocardiography and the absence of significant coronary artery disease could indicate acute myocarditis.\n4. Acute Coronary Syndrome: Despite minimal luminal irregularities on coronary angiography, the patient's presentation with ST-segment elevations suggests a possible acute coronary event.\n5. Prolonged QT Syndrome: The presence of QTc prolongation on ECG can predispose to life-threatening arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation.\n6. Drug-Induced Arrhythmias: Considering the patient's multiple administered medications, including amiodarone and ketamine, there is a risk of drug-induced arrhythmias.\n7. Electrolyte Imbalance: Besides hypokalemia, other electrolyte imbalances such as hypomagnesemia could contribute to the patient's ventricular fibrillation.\n8. Hereditary Channelopathy: Without a family history but given the dramatic presentation, an undiagnosed inherited cardiac ion channelopathy like Brugada syndrome could be considered.\n9. Hepatic Encephalopathy: His history of untreated hepatitis C might contribute to metabolic derangements leading to altered mental status and arrhythmias.\n10. Thyrotoxicosis: Although thyroid function tests were normal, subclinical thyroid disease could still contribute to arrhythmias and increased cardiac excitability."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Olivia C. Smibert: A 48-year-old man with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital because of abdominal pain. The patient had been generally well until 12 years before this presentation, when lymphadenopathy in the axillary and inguinal regions developed and a diagnosis of stage III follicular lymphoma was made. Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone were administered and induced a clinical response; rituximab maintenance therapy was initiated. Seven years before this presentation, recurrent disease developed; rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone were administered. The patient again had a clinical remission, and rituximab maintenance therapy was resumed. Two years before the current presentation, the patient transferred his onco-logic care to this hospital. Swelling was noted in the right inguinal region, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose FDG positron-emission tomography PET of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed extensive FDG uptake throughout the body. Biopsy of a paraaortic lymph node revealed high-grade follicular lymphoma. Salvage chemotherapy with cisplatin, gemcitabine, rituximab, and dexamethasone was administered, and the patient had an early clinical remission. Four months later, and 20 months before the current presentation, the patient underwent autologous stem-cell transplantation after the administration of car-mustine, cytarabine, etoposide, and melphalan. After transplantation, his clinical course was complicated by acute deep-vein thrombosis of the left leg; treatment with therapeutic enoxaparin sodium was initiated but was discontinued after 1 week owing to severe thrombocytopenia. Five months later, clinical signs of lymphoma relapse were observed, and biopsy of an enlarged axillary lymph node revealed transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The patient was subsequently treated with several therapies, including blinatumomab, chimeric antigen receptor CAR T cells, and pembrolizumab, none of which induced a sustained clinical response. Because of the lack of clinical response, allogeneic stem-cell transplantation was considered. Two and a half weeks before this presentation, the patient was admitted to this hospital for severe pain in the epigastrium and bilateral inguinal regions. Laboratory studies revealed a lactate dehydrogenase level of 1560 U per liter reference range, 110 to 210, an alanine amino-transferase level of 127 U per liter reference range, 10 to 55, an aspartate aminotransferase level of 143 U per liter reference range, 10 to 40, an alkaline phosphatase level of 1506 U per liter reference range, 30 to 100, and a total bilirubin level of 2.5 mg per deciliter reference range, 0.0 to 1.0. Computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed several clustered small pulmonary nodules, progressive hepatosplenomegaly with normal-appearing bile ducts, multifocal enlarging lymph nodes, and new small-volume ascites. Oral methadone and morphine sulfate and a 5-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone were administered, resulting in alleviation of pain and improvement in liver function. The patient was discharged home on the fifth hospital day. Two weeks after discharge, the patient was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital for recurrent severe, sharp pain in the bilateral inguinal regions, as well as diffuse abdominal pain in the upper quadrants that was no longer responsive to oral analgesic agents. He also reported night sweats, decreased energy, poor appetite, nausea, and constipation. He did not have fevers, chills, headache, vision changes, shortness of breath, cough, or dysuria. Medications were acyclovir, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, ny-statin oral elixir, methadone, morphine sulfate, citalopram, omeprazole, simethicone, and a multivitamin, as well as lorazepam and laxatives as needed. He had no known allergies to medications. The patient was born and raised in central Mexico and often returned to visit family. He had moved to the United States 2 years before this presentation. He lived with his wife and two adolescent daughters in an urban neighborhood in New England. He worked in the information technology industry. He had previously smoked one cigarette daily and had quit 4 years earlier; he drank one beer every other week and did not use illicit drugs. His mother had had breast cancer, and his father had had coronary artery disease, hypertension, and alcohol use disorder. His children were healthy. On examination in the oncology clinic, the temperature was 36.7C, the pulse 138 beats per minute, the blood pressure 123/84 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 61.5 kg, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 20.0. He had cachexia and was in moderate distress from pain. The mucous membranes were dry, and thrush was present in the oro-pharynx. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds; the right and left upper quadrants were moderately tender on palpation. Painful lymphadenopathy involving the cervical, supra-clavicular, and inguinal chains was present. The patient was oriented to person, place, and time, and no confusion was noted. There was no rash. Blood levels of electrolytes and results of renal function tests and urinalysis were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the oncology unit of this hospital. On arrival at the oncology unit, the patient was observed to be in severe pain. Intravenous morphine and normal saline were administered. A platelet transfusion was begun. Thirty minutes later, shaking chills and diaphoresis developed. On examination, the temperature was 39.1C, and the oxygen saturation was 85 while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was somnolent and oriented to self but not to location or time, and he had slow, nonsensical speech. Blood cultures were obtained. Oxygen, intravenous cefepime and meperidine, and oral metro-nidazole and acetaminophen were administered; the administration of fentanyl with a patient-controlled analgesia pump was begun for pain control. By the following morning, the patients mental status had returned to baseline. On the second hospital day, abdominal pain and low-grade fever persisted. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Filgrastim was administered. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed heterogeneous liver parenchyma, diffuse thickening of the gallbladder wall, and no dilatation of the bile ducts. Dr. Avinash Kambadakone: CT of the abdomen and pelvis Fig. 1A, 1B, and 1C, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple new, poorly circumscribed hypodense lesions throughout the liver and new bilateral pleural effusions. There was gradual reduction in the multifocal abdominopelvic lymph-adenopathy and stable splenomegaly with hypo-dense splenic lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the liver was recommended for further characterization of the lesions. Dr. Smibert: On the third hospital day, abdominal pain and low-grade fevers persisted and intermittent episodes of somnolence and confusion, including inability to respond to questions, recurred. Laboratory studies revealed an ammonia level of 59 mol per liter reference range, 12 to 48, a lipase level of 260 U per liter reference range, 13 to 60, and an amylase level of 187 U per liter reference range, 3 to 100; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Kambadakone: MRI of the liver Fig. 1D, 1E, and 1F with cholangiopancreatography, performed after the administration of intravenous gadolinium, confirmed the presence of multiple ill-defined foci throughout the liver, with hyper-intensity on T2-weighted imaging and no appreciable enhancement, and also showed focal lesions of a similar appearance throughout the spleen. There was no dilatation of the bile ducts. The imaging findings suggested the diagnostic possibility of hepatosplenic microabscesses or new lymphomatous deposits. Dr. Smibert: A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Disseminated cryptococcosis. ", "prediction": "1. Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma relapse: Given the patient's history of lymphoma, progressive hepatosplenomegaly, new liver lesions, and lymphadenopathy, a relapse or progression of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is highly likely.\n2. Hepatosplenic Microabscesses: The imaging findings of multiple ill-defined foci in the liver and spleen, along with elevated inflammatory markers and fever, suggest the possibility of microabscess formation.\n3. Sepsis: The patient’s fever, chills, diaphoresis, and altered mental status shortly after admission are highly indicative of a systemic infection, possibly related to neutropenia or previous chemotherapy.\n4. Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH): The patient's history, recent infections, fever, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, hyperferritinemia, and elevated liver enzymes could point towards HLH, especially in the context of immunosuppression and lymphoma.\n5. Drug-induced Hepatotoxicity: Elevated liver enzymes might be explained by toxicity from multiple drugs, including chemo regimens and supportive medications like acetaminophen or chronic opioids.\n6. Hepatic Veno-occlusive Disease: Post-stem cell transplantation complications such as veno-occlusive disease could explain the hepatosplenomegaly, elevated liver enzymes, and multiple liver lesions.\n7. Fungal Infection: Prolonged immunosuppression and acute signs of infection, coupled with imaging findings, raise the concern for disseminated fungal infections, such as invasive candidiasis or aspergillosis.\n8. Portal Vein Thrombosis: The patient’s abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, and history of deep-vein thrombosis might suggest portal vein thrombosis as a differential.\n9. Paraneoplastic Syndromes: The constellation of systemic symptoms such as fevers, night sweats, and confusion could be indicative of a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with lymphoma.\n10. Autoimmune Hepatitis: Elevated liver enzymes and hepatosplenomegaly in the absence of a clear infectious cause could prompt consideration of an autoimmune etiology, even if less likely in this immunosuppressed state."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Kevin L. Ard: A 63-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital in the spring because of fever, confusion, headache, garbled speech, fatigue, vision changes, lym-phocytic pleocytosis, and an elevated protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid CSF. Approximately 5 years before the current presentation, the patient had received a diagnosis of primary membranous nephropathy at another hospital. Treatment with oral prednisone and cyclosporine was initiated. Two years later, the patient was referred to the nephrology clinic of this hospital for worsening proteinuria and hypertension; rituximab, prednisone, and cyclo-phosphamide were administered. During the next 21 months, he received four doses of rituximab, the last of which was administered 3 months before this presentation. Three months before this presentation, the patient had a flash of light accompanied by transient sharp pain in the left retro-orbital area and forehead, with monocular blurry vision. He was subsequently evaluated at the other hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI and computed tomography CT of the head were normal. Intravenous normal saline was administered, and he was discharged. One week later, the patient was reevaluated at the same hospital for an episode of garbled and nonsensical speech with impaired comprehension that resolved after 10 minutes. A CT angiogram and an MRI of the head reportedly showed a sub-acute infarct in the right side of the pons; intravenous alteplase was administered. Transthoracic echocardiography TTE was normal. Mild word-finding difficulties and confusion persisted. After discharge, the patient had worsening vision with floaters in the left eye, headache, photophobia, sonophobia, and fatigue. Three weeks later, he was evaluated by a neuro-ophthalmologist, who prescribed oral butalbitalacetaminophen caffeine therapy and ophthalmic prednisolone drops for suspected uveitis. The vision improved, and headaches decreased during the subsequent 2 weeks; how-ever, 1 week later, he was readmitted to the other hospital with sudden onset of weakness on the right side, facial droop, and garbled speech. The weakness resolved after 10 minutes. CT and MRI of the head and TTE were reportedly unchanged from the previous imaging studies. An electroencephalogram EEG showed focal left temporal slowing, and treatment with levetirace-tam was initiated. The garbled speech resolved after 2 days, and he was discharged from the hospital. During the next week, the patient had recurrent staring spells that lasted for 1 minute, during which his family thought he appeared vacant; low-grade fever also developed, and within 48 hours, the temperature increased to 39.4C and the garbled speech recurred. He was readmitted to the other hospital, and CT of the head was again reportedly normal. Blood levels of calcium, albumin, globulin, ammonia, thyrotropin, lactate, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests and urinalysis. Tests for Lyme disease antibodies, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibodies, rapid plasma reagin, antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ANCA were negative, and levels of complement were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A lumbar puncture was performed; tests for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi and West Nile virus were negative, and a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory VDRL test of the CSF was nonreactive Table 2. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation. A review of systems provided by the patients family was notable for somnolence, fatigue, generalized weakness, unsteadiness, headaches, staring spells, floaters in the left eye, photopho-bia, sonophobia, mild neck stiffness, unintentional weight loss of 10 kg in the past 6 months, and nocturia. The patient reported no muscle or joint pain, rash, eye pain, diplopia, oral lesions, cough, dyspnea, nausea, or abdominal pain. His medical history was notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, early-onset coronary artery disease for which he had received percutaneous coronary intervention in his 50s and for which he had undergone aortocoronary bypass grafting in his 60s, congenital color blindness, colonic polyps, and prostatic hypertrophy. Medications included cyclophosphamide, levetiracetam, aspirin, pravastatin, metoprolol, losartan, hydrochloro-thiazide, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, ome-prazole, calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, ferrous sulfate, a multivitamin, and fluticasone. He had not taken other antibiotic agents or non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs. The patient was a retired government employee and lived with his wife in northern New England. He had recently traveled to Florida and to rural Canada and had spent time hunting. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for approximately 30 years but had quit 7 years before the current presentation. He drank two beers per week and did not use illicit substances. His family history included coronary artery disease in both parents and valvular disease in his mother, psoriatic arthritis in a sister, and sar-coidosis in several siblings; there was no history of renal or neurologic disease. The temperature was 37.2C, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, the blood pressure 128/78 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 20.4. He appeared cachectic, with bitemporal wasting. He was somnolent and difficult to arouse with voice; he was oriented to self and intermittently to place, month, and year. His thoughts were perseverative. On mental-status examination, he was unable to name days of the week backward he named a month and then named the days forward and was unable to perform serial sevens calculations. Occasional word-finding difficulties were noted, although repetition, naming, and reading were generally intact. When asked to remember three words, he could recall only one word after 5 minutes. He reported that nine quarters equaled 4.25. His affect and speech were intact. The cranial-nerve examination revealed blurriness in the visual fields, discomfort with eye movements, and limited upward gaze. There was no weakness or pronator drift; a low-amplitude intention tremor was present in the left hand. The muscle tone was increased in both legs, with diffuse hyperreflexia, pectoralis reflexes, and seven beats of ankle clonus. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, glycated hemoglobin, bilirubin, albumin, prealbumin, total protein, lactate dehydrogenase, high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and results of liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A comprehensive urine toxicology screen was negative, and a serum toxicology screen was negative for acetaminophen, salicylates, ethanol, and tricyclic antidepressants. Screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus HIV types 1 and 2 and Treponema pallidum were negative. Cultures of the blood and urine were obtained. Dr. Pamela W. Schaefer: A chest radiograph was normal. CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no hemorrhage, acute infarction, or mass lesion. Opacification of the right maxillary sinus was noted. MRI of the head Fig. 1 and magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck revealed signal hyperintensity in the sulci on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, with associated subtle enhancement on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images; additional sub-arachnoid and subdural foci characterized by restricted diffusion with no enhancement; nonspecific changes in the white matter; opacifica-tion of the right maxillary sinus; and no vascular abnormality. MRI of the spine revealed multilevel degenerative changes, without mass effect on the spinal cord, cord signal abnormality, or abnormal enhancement. Dr. Ard: Intravenous acyclovir, ceftriaxone, am-picillin, vancomycin, and thiamine were administered. On the second hospital day, the temperature was 37.6C, and myoclonic jerks were noted; marked lethargy, photophobia, and nonsensical speech persisted. The patient was intermittently impulsive and uncooperative. The white-cell count was 17,960 per microliter reference range, 4500 to 11,000, and the blood levels of vitamin B12, angiotensin-converting enzyme, complement, and haptoglobin and CD4 T-cell subset counts were normal. ANCA, antinuclear antibodies, crypto-coccal antigen, cytomegalovirus CMV DNA, EpsteinBarr virus DNA, galactomannan, and B. burgdorferi antibodies were not detected in the blood. A lumbar puncture was performed; the opening pressure was 10 cm of water, and the CSF was yellow and slightly turbid. Additional results of CSF analysis are shown in Table 2. CSF was obtained for culture, cytologic examination, and an autoimmune encephalopathy panel. An EEG showed intermittent periods of theta slowing in the bilateral posterior quadrants, with no epileptiform discharges. On examination by an ophthalmologist, bilateral visual acuity, visual fields, and intraocular pressure were normal, and there was no afferent pupillary defect. Slit-lamp examination of the eyes revealed bilateral posterior vitreal detachment but no cells in the anterior or posterior chambers. Dilated-eye examination revealed edema in both optic nerves, with tortuous vessels. There was no evidence of anterior uveitis, retini-tis, or retinal necrosis. On the third hospital day, the temperature was 36.7C, and the white-cell count was 8300 per microliter. The patient reported improved strength. Tests for bartonella antibodies and Tropheryma whipplei DNA were negative. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed a diffuse decrease in gamma globulin, with an IgG level of 378 mg per deciliter reference range, 614 to 1295, an IgA level of 30 mg per deciliter reference range, 69 to 309, and an IgM level of 7 mg per deciliter reference range, 53 to 334; the serum free light chain levels and the results of immunoelectro-phoresis were normal. A CSF VDRL test was nonreactive, and CSF testing was negative for cryptococcal antigen, eastern equine encephalitis antibodies, enterovirus RNA, West Nile virus RNA, herpes simplex virus HSV types 1 and 2 DNA, and varicellazoster virus VZV DNA. On the fourth hospital day, the patient reported feeling better and having increased strength, which allowed him to walk. Blood tests for cryoglobulin, 1,3--d-glucan, and thyroid peroxidase antibodies were negative. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was calm and cooperative; oriented to person, place, and time; and able to follow complex commands. CSF tests for listeria antibodies, Epstein–Barr virus DNA, and human herpesvirus 6 DNA were negative, as were blood and urine tests for histoplasma antigens. A whole-body positron-emission tomographic (PET)–CT scan did not show fluorodeoxyglucose avidity. The results of a repeat lumbar puncture are shown in Table 2. A repeat ophthalmologic examination revealed the presence of vitreous cells, which were more numerous in the left eye than in the right eye; persistent edema in the left optic nerve; and an increase in the blind spot of the left eye on Humphrey visual-field testing. A fluorescein angiogram showed no evidence of ocular vasculitis. A diagnosis was made. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Borrelia miyamotoi infection. ", "prediction": "1. Viral encephalitis: The presentation of fever, confusion, headache, and lymphocytic pleocytosis in the CSF combined with MRI findings suggests a possible viral etiology, though common pathogens have tested negative.\n2. Autoimmune encephalitis: The patient's fluctuating neurologic symptoms, pleocytosis, and optic nerve edema could point towards a possible autoimmune etiology affecting both the brain and optic nerves.\n3. Neurosarcoidosis: Given the family history of sarcoidosis, nonspecific white matter changes on MRI, and systemic involvement, neurosarcoidosis is a consideration.\n4. Paraneoplastic syndrome: The patient's cachexia, fluctuating neurologic symptoms, and abnormal findings on imaging could potentially represent a paraneoplastic syndrome related to an undiagnosed malignancy.\n5. CNS vasculitis: Persistent headaches, visual disturbances, and changes on MRI despite infectious workup being negative may indicate central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis.\n6. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): The patient's immunocompromised state from rituximab and cyclophosphamide therapy raises the risk for PML, characterized by progressive neurological dysfunction.\n7. Cryptococcal meningitis: Despite negative initial tests, the immunocompromised state and CSF pleocytosis merit consideration of Cryptococcus as an underlying cause.\n8. Lyme neuroborreliosis: Though initial serology is negative, given the geographic exposure and CSF findings, repeat testing for Lyme disease should be contemplated.\n9. Primary CNS lymphoma: The patient's immunocompromised state and persistent neurologic symptoms could be indicative of primary CNS lymphoma, even though initial imaging was unremarkable.\n10. Whipple's disease: The patient's recurrent neurologic and visual symptoms, weight loss, and pleocytosis with previous negative tests for Tropheryma whipplei DNA highlight the need for potential reevaluation for this condition."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Kristin M. DSilva Medicine: A 55-year-old man was transferred to this hospital from a rehabilitation facility because of abdominal pain and painful skin lesions. One year before the current presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of pancreatitis at another hospital after magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogra-phy MRCP performed for the evaluation of chronic abdominal pain revealed pancreatic necrosis and peripancreatic fat stranding involving the pancreatic head and uncinate process. Blood levels of triglycerides and IgG subclasses were reportedly normal, and the patient had not been drinking alcohol; the pancreatitis was attributed to bevacizumab, which had been administered for the treatment of neurofibromatosis. Bevacizumab therapy was stopped for 2 months. After bevaciz-umab therapy was restarted, elevated blood lipase levels recurred without any abdominal symptoms, and bevacizumab therapy was discontinued. Seven months before the current presentation, another MRCP showed pancreatic ductal dilatation and a pancreatic pseudocyst with internal calcification. Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed changes consistent with chronic pancreatitis and a pancreatic pseudocyst. The patient was advised to continue to avoid alcohol and fatty foods. Blood lipase levels returned to normal. Three and half months before the current presentation, pain in the ankles developed. The patient reported that the pain was worse after prolonged rest and that his ankles felt stiff for 1 hour after he awoke in the morning. Two weeks later, pain, redness, and swelling in the left lower leg developed, with a central fluctuant nodule on an erythematous base Fig. 1A. Over the next 2 weeks, swelling and redness of the left fifth toe and the right first metacarpophalangeal joint developed Fig. 1B and 1C. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. Range of motion was limited in the ankles, which had overlying soft-tissue swell-ing and tenderness on palpation. There was also erythema, tenderness, and soft-tissue swelling of the right fourth metacarpophalangeal joint, the left second and third metacarpophalangeal joints, and the right fourth proximal interpha-langeal joint of the hand. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 76 mm per hour reference range, 0 to 15, and the C-reactive protein level was 102 mg per liter reference range, 0 to 8. Blood levels of calcium, uric acid, angiotensin-converting enzyme, rheumatoid factor, cyclic citrullinated peptide, streptolysin, and DNase were normal; tests for antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. A chest radiograph was normal. Empirical treatment with cephalexin was administered. After several days, the patients condition had not improved, and he was evaluated by a rheu-matologist. He received a diagnosis of possible Lofgrens syndrome, and prednisone was prescribed. Over the next 2 weeks, there was a decrease in the swelling and pain in the left fifth toe and right first metacarpophalangeal joint but not in the ankle pain or the skin lesion in the left leg. Pain in the ankles worsened, was minimally alleviated with the administration of oxycodone, and limited the patients ability to walk. The dose of prednisone was increased, and colchicine was administered, with a decrease in the ankle pain and resolution of the skin lesion in the left leg. Five weeks before the current presentation, the patient was admitted to a second hospital with septic and hemorrhagic shock in the context of infected pancreatic necrosis and bleeding from a gastroduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm. Dr. Lauren A. Roller: Computed tomographic CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed multiple peripancreatic fluid collections and irregularity of the branch vessels of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries, including the gas-troduodenal artery, adjacent to areas of pancreatic necrosis and inflammation Fig. 2A and 2B. Dr. DSilva: Percutaneous drainage of the pancreatic necrosis and angioembolization of the gastroduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm were performed. On the fourth hospital day, the patient was transferred to this hospital for further treatment. At this hospital, five intraabdominal drainage catheters were placed, with a decrease in the size of the multifocal fluid collections in the abdomen. Cultures of intraabdominal fluid grew Pantoea agglomerans formerly Enterobacter agglom-erans, abiotrophia species formerly nutritionally variant streptococci, and lactobacillus species. The patient completed a course of piperacillin in combination with tazobactam and was discharged from this hospital to a rehabilitation facility on the 24th hospital day. Seven days after discharge, periumbilical and right lower abdominal pain developed, and the patient returned to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. There was no fever, nausea, vomiting, or joint pain. He reported 5 days of painful skin lesions and swelling of the right leg. Other medical history included hypertension, neurofibromatosis type 2, gastroesophageal reflux disease, sensorineural hearing loss, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and anxiety. There was no history of sinusitis, inflammatory eye disease, neuropathy, or testicular disease. Neurofibroma-tosis had been complicated by cervical spine ependymoma, meningiomas, and vestibular schwannomas and had been treated with bevaciz-umab for 8 months before the diagnosis of pan-creatitis. Medications included aspirin, gabapentin, hydrochlorothiazide, lorazepam, losartan, meto-prolol, omeprazole, oxycodone, pancrelipase, prednisone, tamsulosin, and tolterodine. There was a history of heavy alcohol use, but the patient had stopped drinking alcohol 3 years before this presentation. There was a remote history of tobacco use and no history of illicit drug use. He lived with his mother in a suburb of Boston. The temperature was 37.3C, the blood pressure 107/68 mm Hg, the pulse 118 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 73.6 kg, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 22. The abdomen was soft and nontender, with five percutaneous drainage catheters in place. There was pitting edema in the right foot. A blanching, erythematous, indu-rated plaque 5 cm in diameter with superficial scale was present on the medial aspect of the right knee Fig. 1D; a similar lesion 1 cm in diameter was present on the superior aspect of the right knee. There were two blanching, ery-thematous, thin plaques 1 cm in diameter on the left lateral calf Fig. 1E. There were several nontender, hyperpigmented patches on the lower legs that were consistent with postinflamma-tory hyperpigmentation. There was pain on palpation and diffuse erythema and warmth of the right lower calf. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of kidney- and liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Roller: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a slight decrease in the size of multiple necrotic peripancreatic fluid collections, with drainage catheters in place Fig. 2C. There was evidence of previous embo-lization of the gastroduodenal artery without evidence of residual or new pseudoaneurysm. Duplex ultrasonography of the right leg showed nonocclusive thrombosis in the distal right femoral vein. Dr. DSilva: A specimen of fluid from the largest abdominal collection and a specimen of blood were obtained for culture; ceftriaxone was administered. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Pancreatitis, panniculitis, and polyarthritis syndrome. ", "prediction": "1. Chronic pancreatitis: Recurrent abdominal pain and multiple bouts of pancreatitis with imaging showing pancreatic necrosis and pseudocysts are indicative of chronic pancreatitis.\n2. Infectious cellulitis: The presence of erythematous, warm, and painful skin lesions on the legs with swelling is consistent with cellulitis, especially given the history of infection with Pantoea agglomerans.\n3. Infected pancreatic pseudocyst: The patient's recurrent abdominal pain and previous imaging findings of pancreatic pseudocyst increase the likelihood of an infected pseudocyst.\n4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Duplex ultrasonography of the right leg confirming nonocclusive thrombosis and right leg pitting edema support the diagnosis of DVT.\n5. Lofgren's syndrome: Although initially diagnosed, the persistence of symptoms despite treatment with prednisone suggests the possibility of Lofgren's syndrome.\n6. Panniculitis: Painful, erythematous, indurated plaques on the legs are consistent with panniculitis, especially in the context of underlying chronic pancreatic disease.\n7. Bevacizumab-associated adverse effects: Recurrent pancreatitis and other inflammatory symptoms may be associated with bevacizumab therapy.\n8. Autoimmune disease: Elevated inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP), joint pain, and skin lesions raise the possibility of an autoimmune condition such as rheumatoid arthritis or vasculitis despite negative autoimmune serologies.\n9. Septicemia: The history of septic shock, current elevated heart rate, and presence of drainage catheters warrant consideration of ongoing or recurrent sepsis.\n10. Neurofibromatosis-related complications: The patient's extensive history of neurofibromatosis type 2, compounded by complex treatments, may result in increased susceptibility to various complications including infections and inflammatory responses."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Eugene P. Rhee: A 74-year-old man was evaluated in the nephrology clinic of this hospital because of chronic kidney disease. The patient had been in his usual state of health when he was referred to the nephrology clinic of this hospital for a preoperative evaluation of chronic kidney disease, before a transcatheter aortic-valve replacement TAVR for aortic stenosis. Eighteen years before this evaluation, an elevated creatinine level had been found incidentally during an evaluation of fatigue, malaise, and joint stiffness. The patient was evaluated in the nephrology clinic of another hospital, and biopsy of the right kidney was performed. Dr. Robert B. Colvin: Pathological examination of the kidney-biopsy specimen Fig. 1 revealed glomeruli with thickened capillary walls and mild mesangial hypercellularity. A Jones silver stain showed spikes and bubbles in the glo-merular basement membrane, features typical of membranous nephropathy. The interstitium had an infiltrate of mononuclear cells, plasma cells, and eosinophils, with tubulitis and without granulomas or neutrophils. Immunofluorescence showed staining of granular deposits for IgG and C3 along the glomerular basement membrane and in the mesangium. Other stains C1q, IgA, IgM, fibrinogen, and albumin were negative. Electron microscopy showed widespread amorphous subepi-thelial deposits along the glomerular basement membrane and in the mesangium, with surrounding spikes and podocyte foot-process effacement. Arteriosclerosis and glomerulosclerosis were also present. At the other hospital, these findings were interpreted as membranous nephropathy, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis with eosinophils, and arterionephrosclerosis with global glomerulosclerosis. Dr. Rhee: The patient was told that his kidney disease was consistent with a diagnosis of Sjogrens syndrome. Prednisone was administered for 6 months and then tapered to a lower dose. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate and furosemide was initiated, as was treatment with losartan, although losartan was intermittently stopped because of hyperkalemia; prednisone was continued. During the next 18 years, the creatinine level gradually increased to 3.28 mg per deciliter 290 mol per liter; reference range, 0.70 to 1.18 mg per deciliter 62 to 104 mol per liter. Twenty-five years before the current evaluation, the patient had received a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis complicated by diabetes mel-litus and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. One year later, painless enlargement of the right lacrimal gland occurred. Surgical excision of the right lacrimal gland was performed at the other hospital, and examination of the excised specimen reportedly revealed nonspecific inflammation. The next year, enlargement of the left lac-rimal gland and the bilateral submandibular and parotid glands developed. Dr. Sumit Gupta: Magnetic resonance imaging of the neck, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed masslike abnormalities of the bilateral submandibular and parotid glands. The abnormalities were hypointense on T1-weighted and T2-weighted imaging. Dr. Rhee: The patient declined another glandular biopsy and was told that he probably had Sjogrens syndrome. Glandular enlargement resolved, and during the next 23 years, the patient was treated with prednisone for presumptive Sjogrens syndrome. Two years before the current evaluation, shortness of breath and substernal chest pressure on exertion developed; these symptoms usually resolved after approximately 20 minutes of rest. The patient was evaluated at the other hospital, and aortic stenosis was diagnosed. Four months before the current evaluation, the shortness of breath and substernal chest pressure worsened, such that the patient became unable to carry his groceries a short distance to his house. Additional imaging and cardiology studies were obtained. Dr. Gupta: Computed tomography CT of the heart, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple large aneurysms involving all the coronary arteries, with associated mural thrombus Fig. 2A through 2D; and Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. There was extensive coronary-artery calcification, along with scattered pulmonary nodules measuring up to 4 mm in diameter, multiple mildly enlarged mediasti-nal lymph nodes, and calcification in the tail of the pancreas. Dr. Rahul Sakhuja: Echocardiography showed severe tricuspid aortic stenosis, with bulky calcification of the aortic-valve leaflets with restricted motion Video 2, available at NEJM.org, as well as severe calcification of the aortic root at the sinotubular junction. Coronary angiography revealed large aneurysms with partial calcification involving all the coronary arteries  specifically, the distal left main, proximal and middle left anterior descending, proximal left circumflex, and proximal and middle right coronary arteries  and calcified narrowing between the aneurysmal segments Fig. 2E through 2H. The distal lumens were normal in caliber and were not well visualized because of the slow flow through the proximal aneurysmal segments. There was moderate, diffuse disease in the middle left circumflex artery. Dr. Rhee: Balloon aortic valvuloplasty was performed 3 months before the current evaluation, and a subsequent TAVR was planned. During the current evaluation, the patient indicated that the shortness of breath and chest pressure on exertion had abated since the balloon aortic valvulo-plasty. Additional history was obtained. The patient had chronic back and neck pain due to severe kyphoscoliosis, spinal stenosis, and cervical myelopathy; the pain had been treated 2 months earlier with anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion. He had hypertension, anemia, gout, osteo-penia, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. Medications included prednisone, metoprolol, aspirin, rosuvastatin, furosemide, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, epoetin alfa, cholecalciferol, calcitriol, pancrelipase, alfuzosin, allopurinol, and gaba-pentin. There were no known drug allergies. He had smoked 10 cigarettes per day for 6 years but had stopped four decades earlier; he drank alcohol rarely and did not use illicit drugs. The patient had been retired from his career as a health care professional for 2 years. He was married and lived in a house in a suburban area of New England. His father had had type 2 diabetes mellitus and had died of prostate cancer at 67 years of age, his mother had had pancreatic cancer and had died at 65 years of age, and his younger brother had had type 2 diabetes melli-tus and had died after a myocardial infarction at 46 years of age. On physical examination, the temperature was 36.1C, the blood pressure 176/75 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 24.8. There was a crescendodecrescendo systolic murmur that was heard best at the right upper sternal border. The creatinine level was 3.41 mg per deciliter 301 mol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter 53 to 133 mol per liter, which was similar to other levels obtained during the previous 1.5 years. The urinary protein level was 149.6 mg per deciliter reference range, 0.0 to 13.5; the ratio of total protein to creatinine was 2.23 reference range, 0.15. Results of liver-function tests were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "IgG4-related disease, with tubulointerstitial nephritis, membranous nephropathy, and inflammatory pseudotumor involving the lacrimal gland. ", "prediction": "1. **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) secondary to membranous nephropathy**: The patient's elevated creatinine and findings on renal biopsy, including thickened glomerular capillary walls and subepithelial deposits, are consistent with membranous nephropathy, a known cause of CKD.\n2. **Sjogren's syndrome**: The history of chronic pancreatitis, recurrent glandular enlargement, and renal biopsy findings of tubulointerstitial nephritis suggest an autoimmune etiology, likely Sjogren's syndrome.\n3. **Diabetes mellitus-related nephropathy**: His longstanding diabetes mellitus could contribute to CKD, especially given the coexistence of chronic hyperglycemia and hypertension.\n4. **Hypertensive nephrosclerosis**: The history of hypertension and arteriosclerosis on kidney biopsy suggest chronic damage from high blood pressure.\n5. **Atheroembolic renal disease**: The presence of severe arteriosclerosis and recent cardiovascular interventions such as valvuloplasty increase the risk of cholesterol emboli lodging in renal arteries and causing CKD.\n6. **IgG4-related disease**: The bilateral glandular enlargement, increased IgG levels, and multiorgan involvement, including lacrimal gland, pancreas, and kidneys, are suggestive of this systemic disorder.\n7. **Multiple myeloma**: The presence of chronic kidney disease, anemia, and elevated protein levels in the urine raise the possibility of a plasma cell dyscrasia, potentially multiple myeloma.\n8. **Renal amyloidosis**: Given the elevated urinary protein levels and chronic systemic symptoms, amyloidosis could be considered, especially due to its association with Sjogren's syndrome.\n9. **Lupus nephritis**: Although less likely without specific serologies, the chronic autoimmune presentation and renal findings could also be attributable to systemic lupus erythematosus.\n10. **Polycystic kidney disease**: Though less likely given the lack of cystic findings on imaging, the progressive renal failure and family history could suggest an underlying inherited disorder such as polycystic kidney disease."}

Haimovich Medicine: A 72-year-old woman with a history of rheumatic heart disease was evaluated at this hospital because of weakness and dark urine. The patient had been in her usual state of health, which included recreational swimming and hiking, until 3 weeks before this admission, when she noted an abrupt onset of dark, rust-colored urine after a trip to Europe. During her trip, she had increased her intake of alcohol. She had no other bleeding symptoms and reported no dysuria, abdominal pain, anorexia, weight change, nausea, emesis, or antecedent trauma; she took no nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs. Dark urine occurred with every instance of urination. She decided on her own to reduce her dose of warfarin, which she had been taking for 25 years after mechanical mitral-valve and aortic-valve replacements, and to take one dose of cipro-floxacin, which had been left over from a previous prescription. One week later, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician. Examination was notable for a slightly sallow complexion. The blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, albumin, and alkaline phosphatase were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urine dipstick testing was positive for blood, and a urine specimen was obtained for culture. Ten days later, the patient reported fatigue with activity, and imaging studies were performed. Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed only a punctate nonobstructing renal stone in the left kidney. Outpatient cystoscopy was reportedly unrevealing. Four days later, the fatigue increased, and the patient reported feeling very weak, with exertional dyspnea manifesting as a hard time with walking; her husband noted that she appeared pale, and she presented to her primary care physician for additional evaluation. Examination revealed a systolic murmur and skin pallor. A direct antiglobulin test was negative, the hapto-globin level was undetectable, and the levels of folate and vitamin B12 were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The next day, after the results became available, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. A review of systems was notable for pale and yellow skin, generalized weakness, and dyspnea on modest exertion. The patient reported that her arms and legs felt heavy, without pain or pares-thesia. There was no chest pain or pressure, palpitations, edema, or orthopnea. She reported no bleeding from the oropharynx, nose, vagina, or rectum and no bruising. There were no fevers, chills, night sweats, anorexia, weight loss, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, or other genitourinary symptoms. The patients medical history was notable for dyslipidemia, osteoporosis, resection of breast ductal carcinoma along with axillary lymph-node dissection, and rheumatic fever during adolescence. Two decades after having rheumatic fever, she had severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and mitral stenosis with moderate mitral regurgitation that was complicated by heart failure, exercise intolerance, and pulmonary hypertension; she underwent mechanical bileaflet tilting-disk aortic-valve and mitral-valve replacements 25 years before this admission. Medications included warfarin and atorvastatin. Her warfarin treatment was managed by a local clinic, and her international normalized ratio INR was checked approximately every 3 to 4 weeks; historically, her INRs were within the range of 2.0 to 2.5. There were no adverse reactions to either medication. She lived with her husband and was a former teacher. She was active and enjoyed swimming and hiking. She did not smoke or use illicit substances; she drank wine in social settings. There was no family history of cardiac, renal, or hematologic disease. The temperature was 36.2C, the heart rate 96 beats per minute, the blood pressure 144/65 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air; the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 22.9. On examination, she appeared pale and mildly jaun-diced but otherwise generally well. Examination of the eyes revealed scleral icterus. There was no evidence of bleeding, petechiae, or ecchymoses in the oropharynx or on the skin. The jugular venous pressure was 10 cm of water. Auscultation revealed crisp metallic S1 and S2 sounds, a crescendodecrescendo systolic murmur grade 16 at the right upper sternal border, a harsh systolic murmur grade 36 at the apex, and clear lungs. There was no organomegaly or supra-pubic tenderness. No enlarged lymph nodes were identified. Distal pulses were intact, the hands and feet were warm, and there was no edema. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, lactate, total protein, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, vitamin B12, and folate were normal, as were the results of tests of renal function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, borderline R-wave progression in the precordial leads, and submillimeter ST-segment depressions in the lateral leads. Dr. Brian B. Ghoshhajra: An anteroposterior ra-diograph of the chest Fig. 1A showed sternal wires, chondrocalcinosis, and clear lungs, as well as enlargement of the left atrium. The valve prostheses were not well visualized. Dr. Haimovich: Point-of-care cardiac ultrasonog-raphy that was performed in the emergency department reportedly revealed normal biventricu-lar function, no evidence of pericardial effusion, and a possible clot on the mitral valve. Intravenous heparin was administered, and the patient was admitted to the cardiology inpatient unit. Dr. Mayooran Namasivayam: On the second day of hospitalization, a transthoracic echocardio-gram Fig. 1B and 1C and Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org showed nondilated left and right ventricles with normal systolic function and mobile chordae tendineae in the left ventricular cavity consistent with previous mitral-valve replacement. The mechanical aortic prosthesis was well seated with a mean transaortic pressure gradient of 14 mm Hg and with mild regurgitation. The mechanical mitral prosthesis was well seated with extensive perim-itral annular calcification that extended to the mitral subvalvular apparatus but did not interfere with the opening and closing of the pros-thetic mitral-valve disks, without evidence of thrombosis on the valve. The mean transmitral pressure gradient was 4 mm Hg measured at 80 beats per minute. Mitral regurgitation could not be assessed owing to acoustic reverberation and shadowing. Mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation was present with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 45 mm Hg. There was no echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary-valve disease, ventricular septal defect, left ventricular outflow obstruction, or pericardial effusion. The inferior vena cava was not dilated and collapsed well with inspiration. Dr. Haimovich: The fibrinogen level was normal, and the haptoglobin level was undetectable. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The hematology service was consulted; a peripheral-blood smear showed normal red cells with mild central pallor, 1 schistocyte per high-power field with numerous reticulocytes, and normal white cells and platelets. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Acute hemolytic anemia due to a paravalvular leak of a mechanical mitral valve. ", "prediction": "1. Hemolytic Anemia: The patient's symptoms of weakness, pallor, jaundice, undetectable haptoglobin, and the presence of schistocytes on peripheral smear suggest intravascular hemolysis.\n2. Mechanical Prosthetic Valve-Induced Hemolysis: Given her history of mechanical mitral and aortic valve replacements, hemolysis could result from red blood cell destruction by the prosthetic valves.\n3. Alcohol-Induced Hemolysis: The increase in alcohol intake during her trip could have exacerbated an underlying hemolytic process, especially in someone with underlying vulnerabilities.\n4. G6PD Deficiency: While primarily being a genetic disorder, an acute exacerbation could explain the sudden onset of dark urine after exposure to triggers like certain medications or infections.\n5. Ciprofloxacin-Induced Hemolysis: Though rare, Ciprofloxacin can induce hemolysis particularly in patients with G6PD deficiency or other underlying conditions.\n6. Hepatobiliary Disease: Mild jaundice, dark urine, and slightly sallow complexion could indicate liver disease affecting bilirubin metabolism, despite normal liver function tests.\n7. PNH (Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria): The abrupt onset of dark urine, intravascular hemolysis, and symptoms of weakness could suggest PNH, a rare condition of complement-mediated red cell lysis.\n8. Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia (MAHA): Presence of schistocytes suggests conditions like TTP (Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura) or DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation), despite lack of thrombocytopenia.\n9. Iron Deficiency Anemia: Chronic blood loss due to her long-term warfarin therapy could lead to iron deficiency, though her haptoglobin levels and hemolysis indicators are not typical.\n10. Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS): Considering her age and presentation with anemia and potential ineffective hematopoiesis, MDS could be a possibility despite normal white cell and platelet counts.\n\n"}

OKelly Medicine: A 35-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of lymphadenopathy and thrombocytopenia. The patient had been well until 4 months before this admission, when painless swelling developed in the groin area bilaterally; there were no other symptoms. Three months before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the primary care clinic of this hospital. He had multiple enlarged inguinal lymph nodes, which were mobile and nontender on palpation; the largest was 3 cm in diameter. The white-cell count was 5460 per microliter reference range, 4500 to 11,000, the platelet count 168,000 per microliter reference range, 150,000 to 400,000, and the hemoglobin level 11.4 g per deciliter reference range, 13.5 to 17.5. An interferon- release assay IGRA for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative, as was screening for human immunodeficiency virus HIV type 1 p24 antigen and HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies. The patient was referred for a lymph-node biopsy but chose not to pursue it. Three weeks before this admission, the patient was again evaluated in the primary care clinic of this hospital. The size of the enlarged lymph nodes had not changed, and there were no new symptoms. He was again referred for a biopsy. Dr. Melissa Krystel-Whittemore: Three days later, a core-needle biopsy of a left inguinal lymph node was performed. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimen Fig. 1 revealed necrotic tissue with fibrosis and lymphohistiocytic inflammation; no definitive lymph-node tissue was present. Staining for acid-fast bacilli, BrownHopps staining, and Grocott methenaminesilver staining were negative. No malignant cells were identified. Dr. OKelly: Three days before the current admission, a nosebleed developed and resolved spontaneously. The morning of admission, a petechial rash developed on both legs, and the patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported 3 months of nonproductive cough that had been attributed to gastroesophageal reflux disease. He had no fever, chills, weight loss, night sweats, dyspnea, headache, or palpable masses other than the inguinal lymphadenopathy. He had a history of β-thalassemia trait and deficiencies of vitamin B12 and folate. For the past 15 years, a chronic pruritic rash on the thighs had occurred intermittently. Two months before this admission, he had received a diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection and had been treated with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and omeprazole. Current medications included cyanocobalamin, folate, albuterol, fluticasone nasal spray, and clotrimazole cream. There were no known drug allergies. The patient worked as a scientist and his research involved mice, but he had no pets. He was married and monogamous with his wife. Eleven years earlier, the patient had moved to an urban area of New England from northeast India, where he was born. He had last traveled to India 6 years earlier; family members had visited 4 years earlier. The patient had also traveled throughout all regions of the United States during the past 11 years. He drank one alcoholic beverage weekly and did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs. The patient’s mother had hypertension, and his father had died from valvular heart disease. One of his sisters had received treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis 1 year earlier, and a second sister had latent tuberculosis; a third sister had diabetes. On examination, the temperature was 36.2°C, the blood pressure 127//79 mm Hg, the pulse 82 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.4. He appeared well. Purpura, including a hemorrhagic blister 1 cm in diameter, was noted in the oral mucosa. There were diffuse petechiae on the legs and some petechiae on the torso, flanks, and forearms. There were enlarged, nontender inguinal lymph nodes, which were nonmobile and up to 4 cm in diameter on the left side and were mobile on the right side; no other palpable lymphadenopathy was noted. The platelet count was 0 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver- and renal-function tests and urinalysis. Screening for HIV and hepatitis C virus was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear showed very few platelets and no platelet clumps. There were target red cells and elliptocytes; the morphologic features of the lymphocytes were normal. Dr. Allen P. Heeger: Ultrasonography of the palpable abnormality in the left groin (Figure 2A) revealed a well-circumscribed mass superficial to the iliac vessels, with a thick hyperemic rind and central necrosis. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 2B, 2C, and 2D), performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed a conglomerate lymph-node mass, measuring 4.0 cm by 2.1 cm by 3.1 cm, in the superficial left inguinal region, with peripheral enhancement and central hypodensity. There were similar-appearing lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum and the left iliac chain. There was also mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, with lymph nodes measuring up to 1.4 cm in diameter, as well as a small lymph node in the right minor fissure. The spleen measured 13.5 cm in length (reference range, <12.2 cm). Positron-emission tomography (PET) from the skull base to the thighs (Figure 2E and 2F), performed after the administration of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer, revealed extensive areas of intense FDG uptake in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, as well as physiologic uptake in the pharyngeal and mandibular areas. Dr. O’Kelly: Prednisone was administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, prednisone was stopped and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) was administered. During the next 3 days, the platelet count increased and the petechiae abated. On the sixth hospital day, the platelet count was 83 per microliter. A diagnostic procedure was performed. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. ", "prediction": "1.

Autoimmune thrombocytopenia (ITP): Severe thrombocytopenia with petechiae and purpura, responsive to IVIG, suggests an autoimmune etiology like ITP.\n3. Tuberculosis (TB): Despite a negative IGRA, his history of family TB and necrotic lymph nodes on biopsy raise the possibility of extrapulmonary TB.\n4. Reactive lymphadenopathy: His history of recent H. pylori infection and previous treatments can cause reactive lymphadenopathy, although less likely without an infectious source.\n5. Castleman disease: Multicentric Castleman disease could present with lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms, and increased FDG uptake on PET scan.\n6. Sarcoidosis: Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with systemic inflammation could indicate sarcoidosis, despite no obvious pulmonary involvement.\n7. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH): The combination of fever, splenomegaly, and cytopenias may point toward HLH.\n8. HIV-associated lymphadenopathy: Despite negative HIV tests, a recently acquired HIV infection with associated lymphadenopathy and thrombocytopenia should be considered.\n9. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): The presence of autoimmune thrombocytopenia and generalized lymphadenopathy can be seen in SLE.\n10. Brucellosis: His occupational exposure to mice and travel history makes zoonotic infections like brucellosis a consideration, despite a lack of specific exposure."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Margaret B. Allison Medicine: A 52-year-old man was urgently evaluated because of hypoxemia that occurred on the fifth day he was at this hospital for suspected cancer. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 months before presentation to this hospital, when pain on the right side of the back developed. The pain began gradually after the patient had moved heavy furniture, worsened with activity and coughing, sometimes radiated down the back of the right arm to the elbow, and occasionally awakened him from sleep. During the next 2 months, the pain waxed and waned. Ice, ibuprofen, naproxen, cyclobenzaprine, and physical therapy were prescribed but did not lead to any improvement. One day before presentation to this hospital, the patient was seen in his primary care clinic because the severity of the back pain had increased and numbness and weakness of the right hand had developed. Radiography of the cervical and thoracic spine revealed spondylolisthesis, degenerative changes, and an anterior wedge deformity of the T9 vertebral body of indeterminate duration. The following day, after the imaging results were reviewed, the patient was referred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported severe, sharp, burning pain in the right shoulder, triceps, and upper and middle back. He also noted fatigue and increased urinary frequency. He had hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and hyperthyroidism. Medications included amlodipine, metoprolol, topiramate, raniti-dine, ibuprofen, and naproxen. Peanuts and latex had caused urticaria. Multiple relatives had hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The patient worked in security and did not use alcohol, tobacco, or illicit substances. He identified as Black and as a Jehovahs Witness; he stated that receiving blood transfusions was incompatible with his beliefs. On examination, the temperature was 37.1C, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the blood pressure 162/88 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The paraspinal muscles were tender, more so on the right side than on the left side. Strength was 4 out of 5 when the patient extended his right shoulder and when he gripped the examiners fingers with his right hand. Straight leg raising was normal bilaterally. Oral acetaminophen, ibuprofen, oxycodone, and diazepam and transdermal lidocaine were administered, and the patient was observed overnight in the emergency department. The next morning, the pain persisted; magnetic resonance imaging MRI was performed. Dr. F. Joseph Simeone: MRI of the spine Fig. 1A, 1B, and 1C, performed before and after the administration of intravenous gadolinium, revealed an enhancing, marrow-replacing mass involving the right posterior aspect of the T1 vertebral body, with resultant severe stenosis of the spinal canal and right neural foramen. The bone marrow signal was diffusely heterogeneous, and there were mild compression deformities of multiple thoracic vertebral bodies, including T9, as seen on radiography. Dr. Allison: The blood calcium level was 19.7 mg per deciliter 4.92 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter 2.12 to 2.62 mmol per liter. The anion gap, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and urinalysis were normal, as were blood levels of magnesium, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransfer-ase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, globulin, lactate dehydrogenase, thyrotropin, and prostate-specific antigen; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Serum and urine samples were obtained for protein electrophoresis and immunofixation, and another serum sample was obtained to be analyzed for kappa and lambda free light chains. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Simeone: Computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis Fig. 1D, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, confirmed the lytic lesion at T1 and the compression deformities of multiple thoracic vertebral bodies. Multiple small osteolytic skeletal lesions were identified. There was no evidence of other mass lesions or lymphadenopathy. Dr. Allison: The patient was admitted to the hospital on the second hospital day; a diagnosis of cancer was suspected. On examination, he appeared fatigued and uncomfortable and had a flat affect. There was diminished sensation of the pads of the second and third fingers on the right hand; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Oral acetaminophen, subcutaneous calcitonin, and intravenous lactated Ringers solution, hydromorphone, diazepam, and zoledronic acid were administered. Overnight, the patient became increasingly somnolent, and the oxygen saturation decreased to 91. The following morning, on the third hospital day, auscultation of the lungs revealed bibasilar crackles. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 94. Lactated Ringers solution and zoledronic acid were stopped, and intravenous normal saline, furosemide, and dexamethasone were begun. On the fourth hospital day, a CT-guided bone marrow biopsy was performed. Afterward, trace edema in the legs was noted. Examination of the urinary sediment revealed barrel-shaped crystals, and a 24-hour urine sample contained more than 5 g of protein; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A stool sample was guaiac-negative. Oral cholecalciferol and intravenous rasburicase were administered. Early the following morning, on the fifth hospital day, the oxygen saturation decreased to 86, without shortness of breath. The rate of supplemental oxygen administration was increased to 6 liters per minute, but the oxygen saturation did not increase. The temperature was 37.2C, the heart rate 81 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126/75 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. Auscultation of the heart and lungs was normal. Furosemide was administered intravenously, and chest radiography was performed. Dr. Simeone: An anteroposterior radiograph of the chest showed low lung volumes and otherwise clear lungs Fig. 1E. Dr. Allison: Two hours later, high-flow oxygen therapy was administered through a nasal can-nula rate, 60 liters per minute; fraction of inspired oxygen Fio 2, 1.0; the oxygen saturation remained unchanged. Blood levels of lactate, troponin T, and N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnosis was made.

Renal Osteodystrophy: Chronic kidney disease can cause bone disorders, although the patient does not have known renal issues, it merits consideration in light of the lab findings.\n6. Hyperparathyroidism: Elevated blood calcium and bone abnormalities are characteristic of hyperparathyroidism, possibly secondary to parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia.\n7. Lymphoma: Given the systemic symptoms and bone marrow involvement, lymphoma remains a differential, though less likely without lymph node involvement.\n8. Amyloidosis: The presence of protein in urine and barrel-shaped urinary crystals suggests possible renal involvement secondary to amyloidosis which can also affect bone marrow.\n9. Paget's Disease: Common in middle-aged individuals, it can cause bone pain and deformities, but the systemic symptoms and laboratory findings are atypical.\n10. Spinal Tuberculosis (Pott's Disease): Though rare, spinal TB could cause vertebral lesions and systemic symptoms but is less likely in the absence of typical risk factors and pulmonary involvement."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Neil D. Fernandes: A 29-month-old boy was transferred to this hospital because of a seizure and hypocalcemia. Approximately 2 months before the current evaluation, the patient had a febrile seizure associated with an acute viral illness. After the seizure, his mother reported that his waddling gait had become more pronounced. Two weeks before the current evaluation, the patient was seen in the orthopedic clinic at another hospital. On examination, the cover-up test  in which the distal lower leg is covered and the alignment of the proximal lower leg is compared with that of the upper leg  was negative, a finding consistent with physiologic bowing of the leg. There was a pes planus flatfoot deformity that resolved when the patient was not bearing weight on the foot, and there was an external positive foot progression angle with ambulation. The mother was counseled that the findings were within the normal range for gait and musculoskeletal development. One day before the current evaluation, the mother noticed that the childs legs locked up and appeared shaky when he was walking over a threshold. On the morning of the current evaluation, the patients mother noticed that the child was grunting while sleeping, with his eyes rolled upward and his arms stiffened and flexed. After less than 1 minute, the grunting and movements stopped and the patient vomited. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was transported to the emergency department of another hospital. Vital signs, mental status, and findings on physical examination were reportedly normal. Laboratory evaluation was notable for a blood calcium level of 5.0 mg per deciliter 1.25 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter 2.12 to 2.62 mmol per liter. Intravenous calcium gluconate was administered. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital, arriving approximately 18 hours after a presumed seizure. Further history was obtained from the patients parents. The patient had been delivered at full term and had reportedly met developmental milestones for his age. His medical history was notable for atopic dermatitis, which had been diagnosed when he was 9 weeks of age, as well as multiple environmental and food allergies. One year earlier, evaluation by an allergist had revealed elevated levels on IgE tests specific to food allergens milk, cashews, pistachios, egg whites, almonds, soybeans, chickpeas, green peas, lentils, peanuts, and sesame seeds and environmental allergens dogs, cats, and dust mites, although the patient later underwent food challenges to peanuts, legumes, almonds, and sesame seeds in an allergy clinic and had no symptoms. There were no known drug allergies. The patient had received diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, epinephrine, and topical betamethasone as needed. He had not received any routine childhood vaccinations because of his parents refusal. The patient lived with his mother, father, two older siblings, and dog in New England. Although the mother was a vegetarian, she occasionally included chicken in the patients natural and organic diet. The patients mother had obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety, and his father had oral allergy syndrome and a history of varus knee deformity in childhood. The patients two siblings had atopic dermatitis, environmental allergies, and food allergies. There was no family history of seizure. On physical examination, the patient appeared well and was alert and interactive. The temperature was 36.9C, the height 83.5 cm 3rd percentile for his age, and the weight 12.4 kg 24th percentile for his age. The blood pressure was 95/63 mm Hg, the pulse 114 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. Muscle spasms occurred in the arms and legs with passive movement. Chvosteks sign contraction of the facial muscles was not elicited after tapping on the region of the facial nerve anterior to the external auditory canal; Trousseaus sign carpal spasm was not elicited after exertion of pressure from inflation of a sphygmo-manometer on the upper arm. Muscle power, bulk, tone, and deep-tendon reflexes were normal, as was the remainder of the examination. The blood calcium level was 5.6 mg per deciliter 1.40 mmol per liter, the ionized calcium level 0.88 mmol per liter reference range, 1.14 to 1.30, and the alkaline phosphatase level 673 U per liter reference range, 142 to 335.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Stephanie M. Shatzman Medicine: A 24-year-old man was admitted to this hospital in the spring of 2020 because of headache and coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19, the illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 3 weeks before this admission, when fatigue, generalized weakness, and headache developed. He also had myalgias, nausea, and vomiting but no fever, cough, or diarrhea. Ibuprofen and aspirin did not alleviate the symptoms. Two weeks later, headache and weakness persisted and new shortness of breath, pleuritic pain, and anorexia developed. Five days before this admission, the patient sought evaluation at a local urgent care clinic. The temperature was 36.8C, and the oxygen saturation 98 while he was breathing ambient air. Physical examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A nasopharyngeal swab was obtained to test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Intramuscular ketorolac was administered, and the patient was discharged home with recommendations to quarantine. The next day, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the nasopharyngeal swab, and the patient had a telemedicine visit through the urgent care clinic. He reported headache, nausea, anorexia, and weakness. Four days later, the headache worsened, and he had presyncope; he sought evaluation at the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival at the emergency department, multiple episodes of vomiting occurred. The patient described headache and pain localized behind the eyes, as well as persistent shortness of breath, pleuritic pain, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. There was no fever, cough, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. The patient had undergone an appendectomy during childhood; he reported no other known medical conditions, was taking no medications, and had no known allergies to medications. The patient was born in Central America and was a university student there when he immi-grated to the United States 3 months before admission. He worked in landscaping. He had had heterosexual contacts before immigration and reported that he had used condoms. He did not smoke tobacco or electronic cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He lived in an apart-ment in an urban area of Massachusetts with nine other people, including his brother and sister and their families. The patient did not know his family medical history. On examination, the temperature was 36.1C, the blood pressure 134/90 mm Hg, the heart rate 62 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 21.3. The patient appeared fatigued, diaphoretic, and lethargic. He was intermittently agitated and increasingly somnolent, falling asleep multiple times during a conversation. He frequently squeezed his eyes closed and used his hands to hit his head, stating that it hurt. The pupils were equal and reactive to light; there was no nuchal rigidity. He was alert and oriented and followed commands. Cranial nerve examination was normal, but rotation of the head or lifting of the leg caused pain in the head, eyes, and neck. The lungs were clear. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of urinalysis and urine and blood toxicologic screening were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiography revealed no opacities. Acetaminophen and intravenous fluids were administered. Ninety minutes later, the patient was found on the ground next to the stretcher, on his hands and knees, incontinent of urine. Intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir were administered empirically. Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: Computed tomography CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no intracranial hemorrhage, mass, or large infarct. There was subtle hypodensity of the basal ganglia. There was posterior flattening of both globes and a partially empty sella turcica. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed posterior flattening of both globes and tapering of the transverse sinuses. T2-weighted images and T2weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed multiple small hyperintense foci in the caudate nuclei and putamina Fig. 1; several foci appeared to be cystic. In addition, there were scattered hyperintense foci in the subcorti-cal and periventricular white matter of the frontal lobes and the anterior corona radiata. Dr. Shatzman: Lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was higher than 55 cm of water, and the cerebrospinal fluid CSF was colorless. On CSF analysis, the total protein level was 47 mg per deciliter reference range, 5 to 55, and the glucose level 42 mg per deciliter 2.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter 2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter. There were 108 white cells per microliter reference range, 0 to 5, of which 81 were lymphocytes and 18 were monocytes. The patient was admitted to the neurology intensive care unit ICU 17 hours after presentation. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis and advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection. ", "prediction": "1. COVID-19-related encephalitis: The patient presents with a headache, nausea, vomiting, myalgias, and altered mental status in the setting of a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can cause encephalitis.\n2. Viral meningitis: The elevated white cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid, predominantly lymphocytic, suggests a viral cause, and his headache and neck pain could indicate meningitis.\n3. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH): The high opening pressure on lumbar puncture and symptoms of headache and visual disturbances point towards IIH.\n4. Central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis: The MRI findings of hyperintense foci in the basal ganglia and white matter could indicate inflammation of the blood vessels in the brain.\n5. Neurocysticercosis: The patient was born in Central America, where this parasitic infection is endemic; MRI findings could also depict cystic lesions from this condition.\n6. Tuberculous meningitis: This should be considered due to the patient's origin from a country with a high incidence of tuberculosis and the abnormal CSF profile.\n7. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM): The MRI findings of scattered hyperintense foci in the subcortical and periventricular white matter are consistent with ADEM, a post-infectious autoimmune condition.\n8. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): The MRI's subtle hypodensity of basal ganglia and other findings may suggest PRES, especially considering the patient's hypertension history.\n9. Metabolic encephalopathy: Elevated intracranial pressure and altered mental status could be secondary to a metabolic disturbance such as hepatic or renal dysfunction.\n10. Carcinomatous meningitis: Though less likely, this condition should be considered due to the elevated CSF protein, lymphocytic pleocytosis, and persistent headache, especially in a new immigrant with unknown full medical history."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Natasha Merali Medicine: A 76-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of lethargy and altered mental status. The patient had been well until 2 months before this evaluation, when she was admitted to another hospital for community-acquired pneumonia. Empirical treatment with ceftriaxone and azithromycin was administered, and her condition partially improved. Two weeks later, the patient presented to the other hospital with recurrent dyspnea and lethargy. A partly loculated right pleural effusion was identified. Empirical treatment with vancomycin and piperacillintazobactam was administered intravenously. Thoracostomy placement of a chest tube for drainage was performed, and pleural fluid analysis revealed an exudative pleural effusion; Grams staining showed no neutrophils or microorganisms, culture showed no growth, and cytologic testing showed no malignant cells. After a 1-week admission, the dyspnea abated, and the patient was discharged with instructions to complete a 2-week course of antibiotic therapy. Two weeks before this evaluation, generalized weakness and lethargy developed, along with new diffuse headache. The patients family thought that she appeared somnolent and clumsy while walking. Four days later, her family took her to the other hospital for evaluation. A review of systems was notable for dys-pnea, leg edema, and hematochezia and no fever, chills, chest pain, cough, dysuria, hematuria, or melena. The temperature was 37.2C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 1761/01 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while she was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The patient was alert and oriented but appeared to be confused when recalling recent events. She had jugular venous distention, diffuse lung rales, and 2 symmetric pitting edema of the lower legs up to the knees. The blood urea nitrogen level was 83 mg per deciliter 29.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 6 to 20 mg per deciliter 2.1 to 7.1 mmol per liter, the creatinine level 4.9 mg per deciliter 433 mol per liter; reference range, 0.4 to 1.1 mg per deciliter 35 to 97 mol per liter, and the hematocrit 26 reference range, 34 to 45. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: Chest radiography re-vealed a small right pleural effusion and moderate interstitial pulmonary edema. Computed tomography CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a chronic subcortical infarct of the right frontal lobe, as well as diffuse involutional changes and nonspecific white-matter hypoden-sities. Dr. Merali: Oral labetalol, clonidine, and hydra-lazine and intravenous furosemide were admin-istered to treat possible hypertensive emergency. During the next 2 days, the patients headache and anemia worsened and dizziness developed. On the seventh hospital day, there was an acute episode of nonbloody emesis, followed by a generalized tonicclonic seizure lasting 1 minute. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit ICU of the other hospital. Dr. Gonzalez: Repeat CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed findings similar to those of the previous study. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head Fig. 1, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed two foci of restricted diffusion in the right frontal lobe and the left cerebellar hemisphere, each measuring 1 cm in diameter, with surrounding signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR images. In addition, there was diffuse ventricular enlargement, with surrounding smooth hyperintensity on T2-weighted and FLAIR images; this finding is suggestive of communicating hydrocephalus with transependymal flow of cerebrospinal fluid CSF. T2-weighted and FLAIR images also showed multiple foci of hyperintensity scattered throughout the deep white matter. Dr. Merali: Video electroencephalography revealed epileptiform discharges predominantly in the frontal lobe, with generalized slowing. Levetiracetam, vancomycin, and ceftazidime were administered; intermittent hemodialysis was initiated. During the next 3 days, the patient began to have a right gaze preference, left hemineglect, and aphasia. The temperature increased to 39.4C, and chills developed. Blood specimens were obtained for microbiologic culture. Lumbar puncture was deferred, pending additional imaging studies to rule out a space-occupying lesion. Empirical treatment with vancomycin, ceftazi-dime, ampicillin, metronidazole, and acyclovir was administered intravenously. At the request of her family, the patient was transferred to the ICU of this hospital. On arrival at this hospital, additional history was obtained from the patients family. Two years earlier, the patient had received a diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma, which was treated with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin. Therapy was discontinued after three of six cycles because of ileus, renal injury, and neutropenic fever. Robotic subtotal gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were then performed; histologic examination of the resected tissue revealed a nearly complete response of the adenocarcinoma. Five months before the current evaluation, CT with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose FDGpositron-emission tomography performed at the other hospital revealed FDG avidity in nonenlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, retroperito-neum, porta hepatis, and right cervical region. Biopsy was offered, but the patient chose to undergo active surveillance. Additional medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and stage 5 chronic kidney disease. Medications included torsemide, amlodipine, clonidine, hydrala-zine, hydrochlorothiazide, labetalol, rosuvastatin, insulin, levothyroxine, cholecalciferol, mirtazap-ine, and oxycodone. There were no known drug allergies. Four decades before the current admission, the patient had immigrated to the United States from an island off the west coast of Africa. She was widowed, had four children, and lived with a pet parrot in an urban area of New England. Two months before hospitalization, she had been independent in activities of daily living and had received minimal assistance, such as with buying groceries, from family members. The patient had traveled to her country of origin 8 years earlier and to South America and the Caribbean in the past year. She had had no sexual partners in the past three decades. She did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. Her sister had received a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer at 60 years of age; there was no family history of rheumatologic, neurologic, cardiovascular, or renal disease. On examination, the temperature was 36.8C, the heart rate 93 beats per minute, the blood pressure 170/92 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 23.8. The patient was somnolent and variably oriented to self but not to situation, location, or time. She intermittently opened her eyes spontaneously but did not follow commands or reliably withdraw in response to noxious stimuli. Her face and pupils appeared symmetric; a right gaze preference and left hemineglect were present. There was no evidence of jugular venous distention, rales, or edema, and the abdominal examination was normal. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies and p24 an-tigen was nonreactive. A test for antitreponemal antibodies was positive, and a rapid plasma re-agin test was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Gonzalez: Repeat CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed foci of hypoattenuation in the left superior cerebellar hemisphere and the right frontal lobe that corresponded to the foci of restricted diffusion on MRI observed at the other hospital. Dr. Merali: Empirical treatment with vancomy-cin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, metronidazole, and acyclovir was administered intravenously. On the second hospital day, a lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was 15 cm of water. The CSF was slightly yellow, with a glucose level of 18 mg per deciliter 1.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter 2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter and a protein level of 173 mg per deciliter reference range, 5 to 55. There were 236 nucleated cells per microliter reference range, 0 to 5, of which 69 were neutrophils, 19 lymphocytes, and 12 mono-cytes. Grams staining of the CSF showed abundant neutrophils and mononuclear cells; no organisms were identified. Transthoracic echo-cardiography revealed mild left ventricular hypo-kinesis and aortic sclerosis. On the fourth hospital day, new right esopho-ria developed and the patient was less responsive. The trachea was intubated and mechanical ventilation was initiated for airway protection. Dr. Gonzalez: Repeat MRI of the head Fig. 2, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed enlargement of the previously observed lesions in the right frontal lobe and left cerebellum. There were additional foci of reduced diffusivity, with corresponding hyperintense signal abnormalities on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, involving both cerebral hemispheres, deep gray matter, the brain stem, and the cerebellum. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal narrowing of branches of the bilateral middle and posterior cerebral arteries. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed small bilateral pleural effusions and no other abnormalities. Dr. Merali: Empirical treatment with methyl-prednisolone was started. The next day, repeat lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was 16 cm of water. The CSF was slightly yellow, with a glucose level of 179 mg per deciliter 9.9 mmol per liter and a protein level of 181 mg per deciliter. There were 286 nucleated cells per microliter, of which 83 were neutrophils, 9 lymphocytes, and 8 monocytes. Grams staining of the CSF showed abundant neutrophils and moderate mononuclear cells; there were no organisms. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis meningitis. ", "prediction": "1. Bacterial meningitis: Given the patient's altered mental status, CSF findings with elevated white cells, low glucose, high protein, and neutrophil predominance, bacterial meningitis is highly likely.\n2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of systemic infection, including fever, chills, altered mental status, and sepsis could explain the constellation of symptoms.\n3.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Sunu S. Thomas: A 26-year-old pregnant woman was transferred to this hospital for evaluation and treatment of cardiogenic shock after a cardiac arrest resulting from ventricular tachycardia. The patient had had two previous uncomplicated pregnancies and was currently pregnant at 32 weeks of gestation with monochorionic, diamniotic twins. Her pregnancy had been monitored for polyhydramnios by her obstetrician with the use of serial fetal ultrasonography. Three weeks before presentation to this hospital, one of the patients preschool-age children had an ear infection and the other had a sore throat. The patient had erythema in the eyes with greenish drainage, for which topical erythromycin and sulfacetamide were prescribed. One week later, a nonproductive cough complicated by a sore throat and ear pain developed. The patient also noted new edema in her legs that was not associated with pain, redness, or warmth. However, during the subsequent week, progressive pain in her right leg occurred, which prompted her to seek care at an emergency department of another hospital. On examination, the temperature was 37.0C, the pulse 113 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg. Pitting edema of the legs was noted, with no associated erythema, warmth, or tenderness on palpation of the calves. Ultrasonog-raphy of the right leg reportedly showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis, and a rapid test for streptococcal antigen was negative. While the patient was in the emergency department, painful uterine contractions with back discomfort developed; the cervix was 2 cm dilated. She was admitted to the labor and delivery unit for management of preterm labor. Intramuscular betamethasone and magnesium sulfate were administered for maturation of the fetal lungs and tocolysis, respectively. Continuous intravenous infusion of lactated Ringers solution was initiated. Subcutaneous heparin was not administered, because delivery was thought to be imminent. After 24 hours of magnesium sulfate therapy, the uterine contractions remained unchanged, and no further cervical dilatation was noted. Because of concern about preterm labor, she remained hospitalized, with continuous monitoring of the fetal heart rate. Five days after admission to the labor and delivery unit, the patient had tenderness in the left leg, and the edema in both legs had worsened. She also had episodes of severe coughing but reported no chest pain or shortness of breath. On examination, the temperature was 36.9C, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the blood pressure 96/51 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air. Auscultation of the lungs revealed expiratory wheezes. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Doppler ultrasound examination of the legs revealed an occlusive thrombus in the left peroneal vein. The hematology service was consulted, and an intravenous heparin infusion was initiated. Intravenous furosemide and oral azithro-mycin and guaifenesin were also administered. The next morning, after the patient had eaten breakfast, she had sudden severe, crushing chest pain and became unresponsive and pulseless. Telemetry revealed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia at a rate of 178 beats per minute, with a right bundle-branch block pattern with a superior axis. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated, and after the administration of epinephrine and cardioversion, the return of spontaneous circulation was achieved within 4 minutes. Intravenous infusions of norepinephrine, vasopressin, dopamine, propofol, and fentanyl were administered. The trachea was intubated, and ventilatory support was initiated. An emergency cesarean section was performed, and two healthy male infants were delivered, with an estimated intraop-erative blood loss of 1600 ml. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Andrew S. Fox: Computed tomography CT of the chest Fig. 1A and 1B, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening, findings that were consistent with pulmonary edema; bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion; cardiomegaly with biventricular enlargement; and dilatation of the main pulmonary artery, which measured 3.8 cm in diameter. No pulmonary embolus was identified. Dr. Thomas: A transthoracic echocardiogram showed biventricular dilatation and severely de-creased biventricular systolic function, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion. Furosemide was administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred to a nearby tertiary care center for further treatment. On arrival at the second hospital, 210 minutes after the cardiac arrest, the pulse was 177 beats per minute, and the mean arterial pressure was 65 mm Hg while the patient was receiving intravenous infusions of norepinephrine, dopamine, and vasopressin. Physical examination was notable for diffusely coarse breath sounds, rapid regular heart sounds, and generalized edema. Thirty minutes after arrival at the second hospital, the patient underwent cannulation for femoral veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO, and an intravenous infusion of milrinone was initiated. Ventricular tachycardia recurred; intravenous magnesium and lidocaine were administered, and the arrhythmia was terminated with cardioversion. Plans were made to transfer the patient by helicopter to this hospital, and intravenous vecuronium was given in preparation for transport. During the flight, severe vaginal bleeding developed, and 2 units of packed red cells were transfused; however, the heparin infusion was continued, given the presence of the ECMO circuit. On arrival at this hospital, 10 hours after the cardiac arrest, additional information was obtained from the patients sister and grandmother. The patient had a history of childhood asthma, obesity, anxiety, and depression. She had previously delivered two healthy, full-term children; her current pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus and polyhydramnios of one of the fetuses. Her medication history included insulin, inhaled albuterol, sertraline, iron sulfate, and folic acid. She had had no known adverse drug reactions. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was married and had two healthy preschool-age children, in addition to her two newborns. Her mother had died from ovarian cancer; her sister was healthy. On examination, the temperature was 36.2C, the pulse 123 beats per minute, and the mean arterial pressure 76 mm Hg without intrinsic arterial pulsatility while the patient was receiving ECMO support. The respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was receiving oxygen through volume assistcontrol mechanical ventilation, with a delivered tidal volume of 290 ml and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 1.0. The weight was 105 kg, the height 163 cm, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 39.5. The central venous pressure was 4 mm Hg. The pupils were equal and briskly reactive to light; once the patient was weaned off propofol, she was able to follow commands and move her arms and legs. Breath sounds were coarse bilaterally and diminished at the bases. Heart sounds were distant. The abdomen was soft and obese; no active bleeding was noted from the surgical incision, but large-volume vaginal bleeding and clots were observed. The arms and legs were warm and had moderate symmetric pitting edema. The femoral venous and arterial cannulas were secured in place in the right groin. The blood level of thyrotropin was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for influenza viruses, adenovirus, human meta-pneumovirus, and parainfluenza virus were negative. Dr. Fox: Chest radiography Fig. 1C, performed at the time of transfer to this hospital, revealed interstitial opacities, a small left pleural effusion, and a dense retrocardiac opacity on the left side. The venous ECMO drainage cannula and a central venous catheter were visible in the right atrium. Dr. Thomas: An electrocardiogram Fig. 2A showed normal sinus rhythm, right bundle-branch block, borderline-low QRS voltage, and Q waves with T-wave inversions in the anterior and lateral leads. Dr. Doreen DeFaria Yeh: Transthoracic echocar-diography Fig. 2B; and Videos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org, performed while the patient was receiving ECMO support, revealed a dilated left ventricular cavity with normal wall thickness and severe diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis that was most prominent in the anterior, anteroseptal, and lateral territories, with an estimated ejection fraction of 11. Additional notable findings included moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, moderate right ventricular dysfunction and dilatation, an estimated pulmonary-artery systolic pressure of 53 mm Hg, a small pericardial effusion, and a pleural effusion. The ECMO inflow cannula was visualized in the inferior vena cava, and consistent with systemic ECMO blood flows, the aortic valve was observed not to open during the cardiac cycle, which suggested very poor native left ventricular contraction. There was no evidence of intracardiac shunting. Dr. Thomas: The dose of milrinone was increased, and the dopamine infusion was discontinued. An oxytocin infusion and rectal misopro-stol were administered. Ongoing large-volume vaginal bleeding was observed, and an intrauterine balloon was placed to control the bleeding. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Cardiomyopathy most likely due to myocarditis or myocardial infarction. ", "prediction": "1. Peripartum Cardiomyopathy: The combination of biventricular dilatation, severely decreased biventricular systolic function, and cardiac arrest in a late-term pregnancy strongly suggests peripartum cardiomyopathy.\n2. Severe Preeclampsia/Eclampsia: The presence of hypertension, edema, and proteinuria along with a sudden deterioration in cardiovascular function could indicate severe preeclampsia or eclampsia.\n3. Acute Myocarditis: The presentation of a dilated cardiomyopathy pattern alongside preceding viral symptoms like sore throat and cough makes acute myocarditis a probable differential.\n4. Amniotic Fluid Embolism: The acute onset of respiratory distress and cardiovascular collapse during labor in a pregnant woman could be due to an amniotic fluid embolism.\n5. Pulmonary Thromboembolism: Despite the absence of pulmonary embolus on initial imaging, the presence of an occlusive thrombus in the leg vein and acute chest pain may suggest pulmonary embolism.\n6. Viral Pneumonia: Diffuse ground-glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening and a history of severe coughing align with a possible viral pneumonia leading to secondary cardiac complications.\n7. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The occurrence of crushing chest pain and ventricular tachycardia could indicate an acute coronary syndrome, such as myocardial infarction.\n8. Drug-Induced Cardiomyopathy: The use of medications like betamethasone and magnesium sulfate in the context of pregnancy could rarely contribute to cardiomyopathy.\n9. Sepsis: Although less likely, the systemic presentation including fever, tachycardia, and a history of infection in the children could suggest sepsis leading to multiorgan failure.\n10. Thyrotoxicosis: Given her history of normal thyrotropin and symptoms of tachycardia and cardiac failure, undiagnosed thyrotoxicosis could be a contributing factor, albeit less likely."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Naomi J. Serling-Boyd Medicine: A 48-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of transient vision loss. The patient had been in his usual state of good health until 1 hour before evaluation, when he noticed white sparkles flickering in the vision of the left eye, followed by sudden blurriness. He had no floaters or eye pain. During the next 2 minutes, the blurry vision worsened and became dark, such that the patient could not see a hand in front of his face when he covered the right eye. He presented to this hospital for evaluation, arriving 1 hour after the onset of vision symptoms. On presentation, the patient noted that the vision in the left eye was improving but remained blurry. The temperature was 36.7C, the blood pressure 120/65 mm Hg, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 24.2. Visual acuity was 2020 in the right eye and was limited to hand motions at 0.9 m 3.0 ft in the left eye; 2 hours later, visual acuity in the left eye was 2040 for distance vision and 2030 with correction for near vision. Results of the Ishihara color test were normal. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular movements were intact; visual fields were full in response to confrontation. Intraocular pressure and results of a slit-lamp examination of the anterior and posterior segments of the eye were normal bilaterally. There was severe ptosis of the left upper eyelid margin reflex distance, 4 mm in the right eye and 1 mm in the left eye. A dilated fundus examination revealed normal optic disks, maculae, and vessels. A nontender, irregular mass was palpable under the left superior orbital rim, but there was no proptosis. The temporal arteries were prominent bilaterally, more so on the right side than on the left side, with normal pulsations and no tenderness. There was no tenderness of the scalp or temporo-mandibular joints. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. A review of systems was notable for fatigue and weight loss of 4.5 kg in the past year, which the patient attributed to inactivity and decreased appetite. There was a 2-month history of bilateral jaw pain with chewing of firm foods but not with soft foods. There was lateral hip soreness in both hips after walking but no stiffness. There was a sensation of locking when flexing or extending the right first finger. Two days before evaluation, the patient had a temporal headache on the right side that resolved. He reported no numbness or weakness. The patient had a history of presbyopia. He had not undergone any surgeries, was not currently taking any medications, and had no known allergies. He was born and raised in a country in Eurasia and had lived in the United States for 20 years. He traveled internationally for his work as a university professor. He was divorced and lived with his two children in a house in New England. He had smoked a half pack of cigarettes for 5 years but had quit smoking 20 years earlier. He drank alcohol rarely and did not use illicit drugs. His parents were alive and well, both of his grandmothers had had breast cancer, and there was no family history of ocular or autoimmune disease. Laboratory evaluation revealed normocytic anemia and elevated levels of alanine amino-transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Results of tests of kidney and thyroid function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, glycated hemoglobin, creatine kinase, homocysteine, and lipoproteina. Testing for antinuclear antibodies was negative, and levels of IgG subclasses were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Aspirin was administered, along with empirical treatment with intravenous methylpred-nisolone, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Dr. Hillary R. Kelly: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head and orbits Fig. 1, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed enlargement of the right medial rectus muscle with stranding of the adjacent extraconal fat, as well as an enhancing masslike lesion in the left anterior superior orbit, abutting the left lacrimal gland. The masslike lesion showed a hypointense signal on short-tau inversion recovery imaging. The brain parenchyma was normal. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck was normal, as was ultrasonography of the temporal arteries. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed markedly heterogeneous liver paren-chyma and an enlarged periportal lymph node, measuring 2 cm in largest dimension. Computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis Fig. 1, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple punctate calcifications throughout the liver and hypoattenuation of the right hepatic lobe, as well as diffuse coalescent mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy with coarse calcifications. There was a prominent right hilar lymph node, measuring 10 mm in diameter. The lung parenchyma was unremarkable. Dr. Serling-Boyd: On the second hospital day, diplopia occurred when the patient looked to the far right. On examination, there was mild limitation of abduction of the right eye. After a second dose of intravenous methylprednisolone was administered, the patient chose to leave the hospital against medical advice. After discharge, he took prednisone daily. During the next week, additional laboratory test results became available. Testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ANCAs was negative. Blood testing for blastomyces antigen, coccidioides antibodies, and histoplasma antibodies was negative, as was an interferon- release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Systemic primary amyloidosis. ", "prediction": "1. Giant cell arteritis: The patient has systemic symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, jaw claudication, and a temporal headache, which are highly suggestive of giant cell arteritis, a condition often associated with vision loss.\n2. Orbital lymphoma: The palpable mass under the left superior orbital rim and findings on MRI such as an enhancing mass-like lesion could indicate orbital lymphoma, which can present with localized masses and systemic symptoms.\n3. Thyroid eye disease: The MRI finding of right medial rectus muscle enlargement and associated fat stranding is typical of thyroid-related orbitopathy, although the patient's thyroid function was reportedly normal.\n4. Sarcoidosis: The combination of systemic symptoms, lymphadenopathy throughout the abdomen, and calcifications in the liver and mesenteric region, along with orbital lesions, may suggest sarcoidosis.\n5. Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome: The enlargement of the extraocular muscles and adjacent fat stranding on MRI might indicate this, especially given the acute presentation with vision changes and diplopia.\n6. Metastatic disease: The history of systemic symptoms, prominent hilar and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and orbital findings raises the possibility of metastasis from an undiagnosed primary malignancy.\n7. Myasthenia gravis: The severe ptosis with preserved extraocular muscle function initially and mild limitation later could be indicative of ocular myasthenia gravis.\n8. Tolosa-Hunt syndrome: This painful ophthalmoplegia syndrome could explain the orbital mass and muscle involvement, along with transient vision loss and headaches.\n9. Optic neuritis: Although less likely given the normal optic disk and intact visual field on examination, the transient visual loss and recent onset of symptoms could be early signs of optic neuritis.\n10. Infectious orbital cellulitis: This could present as an orbital mass with inflammation signs on imaging, although the lack of significant systemic infection markers make this less likely."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Benjamin D. Medoff: A 70-year-old woman was evaluated at the pulmonary clinic of this hospital because of increasing dyspnea on exertion and abnormal findings on chest imaging. In childhood, the patient had eczema, recurrent episodes of bronchitis with a cough productive of mucus, and allergic rhinitis; these conditions abated in adulthood. Twenty years before this evaluation, she had community-acquired pneumonia. Fifteen years before this evaluation, she had an inhalation exposure to aerosolized brick and mortar at a construction site near her home; she subsequently had bronchitis that was treated with a course of nebulizers and inhaled glucocorticoids. Twelve years before this evaluation, the patient began to have episodes of coryza, nasal congestion, itchy and watery eyes, and wheezing, especially in the spring or with exposure to cats, dogs, or dust. She was seen by an allergist. Skin-prick testing elicited a response to dust mites, and intradermal testing elicited a response to tree mix and dog dander. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. Presumptive diagnoses of asthma and seasonal and environmental allergies were made. She received prescriptions for fexofenadine, mometasone, and inhaled albuterol, to be taken as needed. Eleven years before this evaluation, computed tomography CT of the abdomen incidentally revealed mild mosaic attenuation  a patchy ground-glass pattern  at the lung bases. Ten years before this evaluation, the patient was seen by her primary care physician because of several weeks of nonproductive cough, nasal congestion, and intermittent wheezing; she received prescriptions for oral loratadine and inhaled pirbuterol, to be taken as needed. Eight years before this evaluation, she was referred to an allergist. She was considered to have a cough in response to angiotensin-convertingenzyme inhibitors. Six years 3 months before this evaluation, she consulted with another allergist. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. The blood IgE level was 1532 kU per liter reference range at other institution, 127, with positive titers in response to cat dander, dog dander, and dust mites. Inhaled fluticasone was prescribed. Three months later, she had mild dyspnea on exertion and occasional wheezing. Pulmonary-function tests showed minimal change Table 1; inhaled fluticasonesalmeterol was prescribed. Five years 9 months before this evaluation, the patient was referred for pulmonary consultation. She reported intermittent wheezing, mild exertional dyspnea after climbing two flights of stairs or carrying groceries, occasional gastro-esophageal reflux, and snoring. The heart rate was 72 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95 while she was breathing ambient air at rest. Examination revealed upper-airway wheezing and was otherwise normal. After the patient climbed four flights of stairs, the heart rate was 102 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91 while she was breathing ambient air. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was reportedly normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and hemoglobin were normal, as was the platelet count; the white-cell count was 11,900 per microliter reference range, 4500 to 11,000 and the eosinophil count was 390 per microliter reference range, 600, with a relative eosinophil count of 3.2 reference range, 0 to 3. Antinuclear antibody ANA and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ANCA levels were undetectable. Dr. Amita Sharma: Chest CT, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation, as well as several lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter. There was no evidence of bronchiectasis. Dr. Medoff: The patient was seen by an otolaryn-gologist. External and fiberoptic examinations, including examination of the vocal cords, were normal. A sleep study revealed mild sleep apnea, with an apneahypopnea index of 7.2 events per hour reference range, 5. The patient was unable to receive supplemental oxygen at night and positive-pressure ventilation owing to side effects. Five years before this evaluation, the patient underwent cardiac evaluation because of ongo-ing dyspnea on exertion. A transthoracic echocar-diogram was normal. Results of an exercise stress test treadmill test were submaximal, with a maximum heart rate at 74 of the age-predicted value but without abnormal findings on electrocardiography. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. Three months later, the patient attended follow-up with her pulmo-nologist; inhaled budesonideformoterol was substituted for inhaled fluticasonesalmeterol, and weight loss was advised. Dr. Sharma: Four years before this evaluation, repeat chest CT, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation and multiple bilateral lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter. All the findings were stable from the previous CT scan. Dr. Medoff: The patient was seen by a second pulmonologist, and inhaled budesonide was substituted for inhaled budesonideformoterol for the treatment of mild intermittent asthma. Results of pulmonary-function tests obtained 4 years before this evaluation are shown in Table 1. Subsequently, the patient was evaluated annually by her first pulmonologist, but after 3 years, she consulted with a third pulmonologist regarding recurrent dyspnea on exertion. Results of pulmonary-function tests obtained 7 months before this evaluation are shown in Table 1. Dr. Sharma: At that time, chest CT, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation and a nodule measuring 6 mm in diameter in the posterior right upper lobe, along with other, diffuse lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter. Dr. Medoff: The blood hemoglobin level, platelet count, and white-cell count were normal; the eosinophil count was 437 per microliter, with a relative eosinophil count of 4.9. The ANA titer was 1:1280, with a homogeneous staining pattern. The IgE level was 2685 kU per liter reference range at other institution, 114, with positive titers in response to cat dander, dog dander, dust mites, and Cladosporium herbarum. Treatment with oral montelukast and inhaled fluticasone umeclidiniumvilanterol was started, along with supplemental oxygen to be used at night and with exertion. After 1 month, the patients symptoms had not abated, and subcutaneous ben-ralizumab was prescribed. Three months before this evaluation, the pa-tients symptoms remained unchanged. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. One month later, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose FDGpositron-emission tomography and CT revealed no areas of abnormal FDG avidity in the lungs. Eight weeks later, the patient was referred to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. The patient reported intermittent wheezing and progressive mild exertional dyspnea after climbing one to two flights of stairs. She had stopped playing a team aerobic sport because of difficulty breathing. The symptoms did not abate with use of the inhaler or benralizumab; they never occurred at rest. She occasionally had a nonproductive cough without hemoptysis, and she had a raspy voice that had become worse in recent months. Coryza, nasal congestion, and watery eyes were not present. She had gained 15 kg during the previous 5 years. The patients medical history included eczema, hypothyroidism, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, borderline diabetes, calcium oxalate neph-rolithiasis, glaucoma, and colonic polyps. She had undergone tonsillectomy and multiple procedures for the treatment of nephrolithiasis, including shock-wave lithotripsy and ureteroscopy. Medications included oral aspirin, amlodipine, atenolol, atorvastatin, atovaquone, levothyroxine, loratadine, losartan, and montelukast, along with a multivitamin; inhaled fluticasoneumecli-diniumvilanterol; and subcutaneous benralizu-mab. Sulfa drugs had caused anaphylaxis, lisino-pril had caused a cough, and macrolides had caused diarrhea. The patient worked as an educator. She had no known exposure to asbestos, mold, solvents, or chemicals. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not have secondhand exposure to tobacco; she drank one glass of wine per week and did not use illicit drugs. She had traveled to coastal areas of Florida and Massachusetts, as well as other areas of New England, but she had not traveled to other areas of the United States or outside the country. The patient was married and lived in Massachusetts with her spouse. There had been no pets in her home for approximately 10 years. There were no damp areas in her home; she used a vacuum cleaner with a high-efficiency particulate air HEPA filter and allergen-proof bedsheets. The patients family history was notable for coronary artery and peripheral artery disease in her father, a sister, and her brother; skin cancer in her mother; breast cancer in a sister; and hypertension and diabetes in multiple relatives. She had two healthy adult children. There was no history of allergic, immunologic, pulmonary, or rheumatologic disease. The temperature was 36.6C, the heart rate 67 beats per minute, the blood pressure 142/91 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 92 while the patient was breathing ambient air. After she climbed two flights of stairs, the oxygen saturation was 87 while she was breathing ambient air. She had a cushingoid appearance. The nasal and oral mucosa appeared normal. There was no tracheal deviation or stridor. Lung auscultation revealed normal breath sounds. There was no clubbing or edema. Mild scattered eczematous plaques were present on the forearms and shins. There were mild Heberdens nodes but no other joint, skin, or nail abnormalities. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood hemoglobin level, white-cell count, differential count with 0 eosinophils, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and cre-atine kinase level were normal. The IgE level was 1307 IU per milliliter reference range at this hospital, 0 to 100, and a hypersensitivity pneu-monitis panel was negative. The thyrotropin level was 8.07 IU per milliliter reference range, 0.40 to 5.00, and the aldolase level 9.3 U per liter reference range, 7.7. The ANA titer was 1:5120, with a homogeneous and speckled staining pattern; the anticytoplasmic antibody titer was 1:1280, with a filamentous and granular staining pattern; and ANCA testing was negative. A transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. Ten weeks after evaluation, at follow-up in the pulmonary clinic, a myositis antibody panel was negative, except for a weakly positive titer in response to anti-Ku antibodies. Tests were negative for ANCA, anticyclic citrullinated peptide, rheumatoid factor, and antidouble-stranded DNA, anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-Smith, antiribonu-cleoprotein, antitopoisomerase I antiScl-70, antimitochondrial, antithyroperoxidase, and anti histidyltransfer RNA synthase antiJo-1 antibodies. Dr. Sharma: Chest CT Fig. 1A and 1B, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed diffuse bilateral mosaic attenu-ation and multiple bilateral lung nodules, including a 6-mm nodule in the right upper lobe. There was no evidence of pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, or lymphadenopathy. Dr. Medoff: Five days later, the patient was evaluated by a rheumatologist at this hospital. A tapering course of oral prednisone was prescribed for the treatment of possible interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features. Ten weeks after the visit with the rheumatolo-gist, the eczematous rash had improved but dyspnea on exertion persisted during long walks. An examination in the pulmonary clinic was notable for clear lung fields and an oxygen saturation of 95 while the patient was breathing ambient air. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. Dr. Sharma: Chest CT, performed without the administration of contrast material, again showed extensive bilateral mosaic attenuation and numerous bilateral solid lung nodules, with the largest nodule, measuring 6 mm in diameter, located in the right upper lobe. There was no evidence of bronchiectasis or reticulation. Expiratory CT Fig. 1C and 1D confirmed the presence of air trapping. Diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia. ", "prediction": "1. Asthma: The patient's long-standing history of wheezing, response to allergens, and use of inhaled bronchodilators make asthma a highly likely diagnosis.\n2. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): Given the history of recurrent bronchitis and dyspnea, COPD remains a strong consideration despite her non-smoking status.\n3. Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis: The presence of bilateral mosaic attenuation and numerous lung nodules, along with a high IgE level, suggest a hypersensitivity reaction, possibly to airborne allergens.\n4. Chronic Eosinophilic Pneumonia: The elevated eosinophil count and history of adult-onset wheezing align with this diagnosis, which is characterized by chronic inflammation in the lungs.\n5. Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD): The repeated CT findings of ground-glass opacities and mosaic attenuation in the absence of pulmonary fibrosis point toward ILD.\n6. Sarcoidosis: Lung nodules and elevated ANA titers might indicate sarcoidosis, although the absence of lymphadenopathy makes it less likely.\n7. Connective Tissue Disease-associated ILD: The positive ANA and anti-Ku antibodies suggest an autoimmune process affecting the lungs.\n8. Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA): Elevated IgE levels, sensitivity to multiple allergens, and lung nodules could be indicative of ABPA.\n9. Pulmonary Hypertension: Given her dyspnea on exertion and normal echocardiogram, this remains a differential that needs exclusion.\n10. Vocal Cord Dysfunction: The intermittent wheezing and raspy voice suggest VCD, a condition with symptoms that mimic asthma but are due to paradoxical vocal cord movement."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Mark A. Matza Medicine: A 68-year-old man was transferred to this hospital because of neurologic decline, progressive renal insufficiency, and leukopenia. Seven months before this admission, the patient was admitted to another hospital after routine laboratory testing had identified abnormalities, including a creatinine level of 3.2 mg per deciliter 283 mmol per liter; reference range, 0.50 to 1.40 mg per deciliter 44 to 124 mmol per liter, a blood urea nitrogen level of 54 mg per deciliter 19 mmol per liter; reference range, 7 to 30 mg per deciliter 2.5 to 11 mmol per liter, and a calcium level of 12.1 mg per deciliter 3.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.8 to 10.6 mg per deciliter 2.2 to 2.6 mmol per liter. Twelve months earlier, the creatinine level had been 1.7 mg per deciliter 150 mmol per liter. On admission to the other hospital, he reported unintentional weight loss of 14 kg over the preceding 12 months, malaise, waking every 2 hours to empty his bladder, and new mild exertional dyspnea. The temperature was 36.6C, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 117/74 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96 while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 68 kg and the body-mass index BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 23.5. Examination was notable for cachexia and hepato-splenomegaly with the liver and spleen palpable 6 cm below the costal margin without lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. Blood levels of magnesium, bilirubin, globulin, creatine kinase, uric acid, and N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Serum protein electrophoresis results were normal; urine protein electrophoresis revealed polyclonal light-chain bands. Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed focal nodular soft-tissue thickening along the aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta. Spleno-megaly and left paraaortic adenopathy were present. Small pulmonary nodules and patchy consolidation were observed, along with a small left pleural effusion. Dr. Matza: After treatment with intravenous normal saline and furosemide, the calcium level normalized and the creatinine level decreased to 2.3 mg per deciliter 203 mmol per liter. The patient was discharged on the fourth hospital day. Dr. Rory K. Crotty: A bone marrow biopsy performed 2 weeks later at the first hospital revealed hypercellular marrow and multiple non-necrotizing granulomas. Staining for acid-fast bacilli and fungi was negative. No cultures were obtained. Dr. Matza: The angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE level was 89 U per liter reference range, 9 to 67. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was considered, and therapy with high-dose oral prednisone was started. One month later, the ACE level decreased to 41 U per liter, and the patients energy level and appetite improved. Attempts to taper the dose of prednisone were unsuccessful owing to increased fatigue and exertional dyspnea. Three months later, the patient was evaluated by a pulmonologist at the first hospital for pulmonary sarcoidosis. Trimethoprimsulfamethox-azole was initiated for prophylaxis against pneu-mocystis while the patient continued to receive high-dose prednisone. Tests of pulmonary function showed mild obstruction, with a clinically significant response after the use of a broncho-dilator, and moderate restriction, with moderately reduced diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide. A second attempt to taper the dose of prednisone was unsuccessful owing to increased fatigue and exertional dyspnea. During the next 2 months, intermittent confusion, progressive weakness in the legs, right foot drop, and increasing unsteadiness and gait instability developed; the patient began to use a walker to ambulate. He also had at least two falls. He required help from his wife to perform activities of daily living, including bathing and dressing. The patient was evaluated by a rheumatolo-gist at the first hospital. Complement levels were normal, as was the level of rheumatoid factor. Tests for antinuclear antibodies ANA, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ANCA, and anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were negative. Weekly treatment with oral meth-otrexate and folic acid was started for presumed sarcoidosis. Eleven days later, the patient presented to a second hospital with a new facial droop on the left side, slurred speech, and confusion. The temperature was 36.4C, the heart rate 102 beats per minute, the blood pressure 141/86 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99 while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The weight was 63 kg and the BMI 21.9. The patient was oriented to person, place, and time; neuro-logic examination was notable for a mild facial droop on the left side, mildly increased muscle tone, right foot drop, and symmetric mild weakness in the arms and upper legs. Cachexia, tachycardia, and splenomegaly were noted. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Pamela W. Schaefer: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head revealed a 12-mm right subdural hygroma with a midline shift of 10 mm, a right cerebellar cavernous malformation, and numerous punctate foci in the pons, left cerebellum, right occipital lobe, and left thalamus characterized by hyperintensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR imaging and restricted diffusion. Dr. Matza: Clopidogrel and levetiracetam were initiated. Echocardiography did not show intra-cardiac thrombus or shunting; carotid ultrasonog-raphy did not show stenosis. Electromyography revealed evidence of mild L5S1 radiculopathy and right ulnar and median neuropathy, but there was no evidence of myopathy or upper motor neuron disease. Owing to progressive leuko-penia white-cell count, 1390 per microliter and thrombocytopenia platelet count, 51,000 per microliter, methotrexate, clopidogrel, levetirace-tam, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole were discontinued; cyanocobalamin was started. On the fourth hospital day, a fever with a temperature of 38.3C developed; specimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture, and intravenous vancomycin and cefepime were initiated. The C-reactive protein level was 101.8 mg per liter. Blood tests for ANA, ANCA, rheumatoid factor, influenza type A and B antigens, human immunodeficiency virus HIV type 1 p24 anti-gen, antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis B virus core antibodies, cytomegalovirus DNA, EpsteinBarr virus DNA, and parvovirus IgM were negative, as were urine tests for legionella antigen and histoplasma antigen. A rapid plasma reagin test was negative, and an interferon- release assay for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was reported as indeterminate. Dr. Shepard: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed scattered ground-glass opacities in the lungs, nodular and consolidative opacities in the lungs, mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, small pleural effusions, and splenomegaly with the spleen measuring 16 cm in the cephalocaudad dimension; normal length, 13 cm. Focal soft-tissue thickening along the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta and prominence of the soft tissue surrounding the infrarenal abdominal aorta were also noted. The next day, magnetic resonance angiogra-phy was performed. A T2-weighted fat-saturated image Fig. 1A showed signal hyperintensity in the soft tissue around the infrarenal aorta and in the adjacent left paraaortic lymph nodes that was indicative of adenopathy, with a focal abdominal aortic pseudoaneurysm seen on time-of-flight imaging Fig. 1B. Dr. Matza: On the eighth hospital day, a bone marrow biopsy was performed. On the ninth day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. On the patients arrival, a review of systems was limited owing to delirium, and history was obtained in part from the patients family. The review was notable for months of fatigue, malaise, leg weakness, right foot drop, waxing and waning confusion, exertional dyspnea, and an inability to walk and perform activities of daily living. Palpitations, dry cough, easy bruising, and irritable bladder were present, but he had no chills, anorexia, joint pain, erythema, rashes, nodules, myalgia, chest pain, dizziness, productive cough, hemoptysis, orthopnea, wheezing, gastrointestinal symptoms, dysuria, hematuria, ocular or nasal symptoms, skin or nail changes, or headache. The patients medical history was notable for hypothyroidism, hypertension, hypercholesterol-emia, progressive kidney disease, degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine, scoliosis, tubular adenoma, and leukopenia. Eight years before this admission, a mass in the bladder that measured 4.5 cm by 4.0 cm was noted on ultraso-nography, which had been performed for evaluation of hematuria. Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor was performed at another hospital, but the resection was reportedly incomplete. Histologic examination revealed non muscle-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma. Repeat cystoscopy and transurethral resection, performed 3, 8, and 16 months after the initial procedures, each revealed fragments of non muscle-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma, and intravesical bacille CalmetteGuerin BCG was administered. Cystoscopy, performed 1 year before this admission for the management of bladder stones, identified a recurrent polypoid bladder tumor, which was treated with trans-urethral resection. Outpatient medications included prednisone, methotrexate, folic acid, aspirin, levothyroxine, simvastatin, tamsulosin, cholecalciferol, sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate, omeprazole, tri-methoprimsulfamethoxazole, fluticasonesalmet-erol, and as-needed inhaled albuterol. Penicillin had caused an unknown reaction. The patient was a retired pharmacist and lived with his wife. He had a remote history of smoking a half pack of cigarettes daily for 2 years and drank alcohol infrequently. He had not traveled recently and had had no environmental, animal, or toxic exposures. There was no family history of autoimmune, neurologic, infectious, or pulmonary disorders. The temperature was 36.8C, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/76 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94 while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The weight was 54 kg and the BMI 18.8. He was anxious, cachectic, and appeared chronically ill. He correctly reported his name, location, and the time and date; however, he was unable to follow simple two-step commands. The cranial-nerve examination revealed a subtle facial droop on the left side. There were tremors in the arms and legs at rest and with motion, as well as right foot drop and diffusely increased tone. Finger nosefinger testing showed dysmetria. Bibasilar crackles greater in the left lung than in the right were heard on lung auscultation. Hepato-splenomegaly was present. There were diffuse ecchymoses on the trunk, arms, and legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. The international normalized ratio and blood levels of ammonia, bilirubin, creatine kinase, folic acid, globulin, haptoglobin, lactate dehydro-genase, lactic acid, and magnesium were normal. The ACE level was 36 U per liter reference range, 8 to 53. Serum protein electrophoresis showed no bands, but a mild, diffuse decrease in globulin was noted. The urine free kappa light-chain level was 134.2 mg per deciliter reference range, 0.4 to 15.1, and the urine free lambda light-chain level was 35.6 mg per deciliter reference range, 0.8 to 10.1, with a normal ratio 3.77; reference range, 0.50 to 4.00. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of blood, urine, and sputum were obtained. During the first 3 days of this admission, the patient became lethargic; when he was awakened, his speech was incoherent and dysarthric. Dr. Schaefer: On the third hospital day, MRI of the head Fig. 2 with magnetic resonance angiography revealed a stable right subdural hygro-ma with a midline shift of 10 mm, as well as a stable right cerebellar cavernous malformation. There were punctate and patchy foci characterized by hyperintensity on FLAIR imaging and restricted diffusion in the midbrain, pons, medulla, left cerebellum, right occipital lobe, and left thalamus; the foci had increased in size and extent from the previous study. Dr. Shepard: Positron-emission tomography PETCT Fig. 1D through 1F revealed multiple foci of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose FDG uptake in periaortic soft tissue and paraaortic lymph nodes, in the axial skeleton cervical vertebral body, ribs, manubrium, and sacrum, and in the left testis. Dr. Matza: Blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, 1,3--d-glucan, coxiella antibodies, cytomegalo-virus IgM and IgG, cryptococcal antigen, human chorionic gonadotropin, and Treponema pallidum antibodies were negative, as was a urine test for histoplasma antigen. Electroencephalographic monitoring showed frequent sharp, irregular delta and theta discharges; treatment with leveti-racetam was started. On the fourth hospital day, the temperature was 38.3C. Ultrasound images showed testes of normal size and echotexture without focal lesions, but the epididymides were enlarged and heterogeneous. The kidneys were normal in size, with diffusely echogenic parenchyma, and a 19-mm bladder stone was present. A transtho-racic echocardiogram showed normal ventricular function, no evidence of clinically significant valvular disease, and a mildly dilated aorta. Flow cytometry showed a markedly reduced CD4 T-cell count 11 per microliter; reference range, 348 to 1456. Antibody tests for bartonella and brucella were negative. Somnolence progressed, and on the fifth hospital day, the right pupil was noted to be slightly larger than the left and the patient had increased tremor. Fosphenytoin therapy was initiated, and he was transferred to the neurologic intensive care unit. The oxygen saturation declined to 90 while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute, and a CheyneStokes pattern of respiration was observed. The trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. A diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Disseminated bacille Calmette–Guérin infection. ", "prediction": "1. Sarcoidosis: The patient has elevated ACE levels and non-necrotizing granulomas on bone marrow biopsy, which are suggestive of sarcoidosis, although treatment has been partially effective.\n2. Lymphoma: The presence of splenomegaly, para-aortic adenopathy, and systemic symptoms like weight loss and night sweats may indicate lymphoma.\n3. Tuberculosis: Despite an indeterminate interferon-gamma release assay for TB, the patient's symptoms and granulomatous findings make tuberculosis a consideration.\n4. Amyloidosis: Renal insufficiency, hepatosplenomegaly, and systemic involvement could suggest amyloidosis, though specific staining or biopsy confirmation is needed.\n5. Vasculitis: The progressive renal insufficiency, neurological symptoms, and CT findings of vascular abnormalities could indicate a type of systemic vasculitis.\n6. Multiple Myeloma: The elevated free light chains in urine and systemic symptoms could point to multiple myeloma, though the patient lacks classic CRAB criteria.\n7. HIV/AIDS: Severe immunosuppression evidenced by a low CD4 count suggests a diagnosis of HIV/AIDS, even though initial HIV serologies were negative.\n8. Idiopathic CD4 Lymphocytopenia: This could explain the markedly reduced CD4 T-cell count in the absence of HIV infection or other identifiable causes.\n9. Subacute Bacterial Endocarditis: Persistent bacteremia and systemic symptoms can manifest as subacute bacterial endocarditis, even with relatively normal echocardiogram findings.\n10. Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH): The constellation of fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias, and high ferritin may point towards HLH, a severe systemic inflammatory condition."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Bart K. Chwalisz: A 65-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of bilateral eye pain and decreased vision. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 days before this admission, when constant aching pain developed in the left eye and the left side of the head. During the next few days, the vision in the left eye gradually became blurry. Three days before this admission, redness developed in the right eye. The patient used tetrahydrozoline eye drops, but symptoms did not abate. One day before this admission, pain developed in the right eye that was similar to the pain in the left eye. The patient sought evaluation by his primary care physician, who recommended that he present to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. On arrival, the patient rated the eye pain and headache at 2 on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The pain was not worse with eye movement or accompanied by flashing lights, floaters, or discharge. The patient reported no trauma but noted weight loss of 4.5 kg in the past 2 weeks, as well as pain with chewing food. He did not have scalp tenderness, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, numbness, weakness, or slurred speech. The patient had a history of Waldenstroms macroglobulinemia, which had been diagnosed 2 years before this admission and treated with plasmapheresis, dexamethasone, and four cycles of bortezomib with discontinuation of bortezo-mib after 4 months because of peripheral neuropathy, as well as six cycles of bendamustine. During the 9 months that followed the completion of treatment with bendamustine, there was active surveillance of the blood IgM level. One month before this admission, the IgM level was 1001 mg per deciliter reference range, 53 to 334, and biopsy of the bone marrow revealed persistent disease. One week before this admission, the patient took his first dose of ibrutinib, which had been prescribed 3 months earlier. Other medical history included latent tuberculosis, depression, anxiety, prediabetes, folate deficiency, and seasonal allergies. Medications included ibrutinib, isoniazid, pyridoxine, sertra-line, citalopram, hydroxyzine, cetirizine, flutica-sone nasal spray, and a multivitamin. Rituximab had caused anaphylaxis. The patient did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. He was originally from Central America and had immigrated to the United States 50 years earlier; 1 month earlier, he had moved from the West Coast to an urban area of New England. He lived in an apartment with his niece and cousins and worked in construction. His family history was unknown. On examination, the temperature was 36.3C, the blood pressure 104/69 mm Hg, the pulse 60 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. Visual acuity was 2020 in the right eye and 20100 in the left eye with correction. On confrontation testing, visual fields in the left eye were deficient in the inferior temporal and nasal aspects. On the Ishi-hara color test, all plates were identified with the right eye but only the control plate was identified with the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light; an afferent pupillary defect was present in the left eye. There was no propto-sis. Subconjunctival hemorrhage was present in the right eye; pterygia were present in both eyes. On funduscopic examination, the optic disk in the left eye was edematous. Results of tests of cranial nerve function, power, sensation, reflexes, coordination, and gait were normal. The blood hemoglobin level was 12.5 g per deciliter reference range, 13.5 to 17.5, the hema-tocrit 39.8 reference range, 41.0 to 53.0, the white-cell count 8090 per microliter reference range, 4500 to 11,000, and the platelet count 131,000 per microliter reference range, 150,000 to 400,000. The IgM level was 540 mg per deciliter; the level of IgM kappa M component in the gamma region was 0.36 g per deciliter. Blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney and liver function. Tests for Lyme disease, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, and bartonellosis were negative. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus HIV type 1 p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Javier M. Romero: Computed tomography CT of the head, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed mild thickening and perineural enhancement along the entire length of the left optic nerve Fig. 1A and 1B. There was a deformity of the left lamina papyracea with medial deviation of the medial and superior rectus muscle, as well as postoperative changes in the sinuses. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head and orbits, performed with and without the administration of contrast material, was limited by artifact but revealed increased signal intensity and possible focal enhancement within the retrobulbar segment of the left optic nerve Fig. 1C and 1D. Dr. Chwalisz: The patient was admitted to this hospital, and a diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Bing–Neel syndrome. ", "prediction": "1. Optic neuritis: Given the patient's age, bilateral optic pain, decreased vision, and MRI findings of increased signal intensity and focal enhancement in the optic nerve could suggest optic neuritis.\n2. Giant cell arteritis (GCA): The combination of weight loss, jaw claudication, and ocular symptoms are highly indicative of GCA.\n3. Acute angle-closure glaucoma: While less likely given the normal ocular pressure, the acute onset of painful red eyes with decreased vision warrants consideration.\n4. Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia-related optic neuropathy: This could cause optic nerve involvement given the patient’s history of this disease and recent high IgM levels.\n5. Orbital cellulitis: The CT findings of perineural enhancement and the patient's history of sinus issues could indicate an infectious process.\n6. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION): The patient’s symptoms and the presence of an afferent pupillary defect and optic disk edema suggest possible ischemic optic neuropathy.\n7. Medication-induced optic neuropathy: Ibrutinib, the newly initiated medication, is associated with ocular side effects including vision changes.\n8. Pseudo-tumor cerebri: Raised intracranial pressure can present with visual symptoms and can mimic optic neuritis or other optic neuropathies.\n9. Toxocariasis: While tests for toxoplasmosis were negative, ocular toxocariasis can present similarly and may be overlooked.\n10.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Alexandra T. Lucas Pediatrics: A 19-year-old man was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit PICU of this hospital because of shock, multiple organ failure, and rash. The patient had been well until 20 hours before this admission, when diffuse abdominal pain and nausea developed after he ate rice, chicken, and lo mein leftovers from a restaurant meal. Multiple episodes of emesis occurred, with vomitus that was either bilious or red-brown. The abdominal pain and vomiting were followed by the development of chills, generalized weakness, progressively worsening diffuse myalgias, chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, neck stiffness, and blurry vision. Five hours before this admission, purplish discoloration of the skin developed, and a friend took the patient to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On arrival at the emergency department of the other hospital, 4.5 hours before this admission, the patient reported diffuse myalgias that he rated at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. On examination, he appeared pale, anxious, and moderately distressed; he answered questions appropriately and was oriented to person, place, time, and situation. The temperature was 37.4C, the pulse 147 beats per minute, the blood pressure 1541/24 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while he was breathing ambient air. The oral mucous membranes were dry. On auscultation of the heart, tachycardia was present with a regular rhythm. The radial pulses were normal. The lungs were clear, without crackles, rhonchi, or wheezes. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, without tenderness; the patient vomited yellow-green material during the examination. The skin was warm and dry and had a mottled appearance. Blood specimens were obtained and sent to the laboratory for culture, a complete blood count, and tests of renal function, liver function, and coagulation, as well as measurement of levels of electrolytes, glucose, lipase, lactic acid, and troponin. A urine specimen was sent for urinalysis and culture, and a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained for influenza virus nucleic acid testing. Approximately 40 minutes after the patients arrival at the other hospital, ondansetron, ceftriaxone, and a 2-liter bolus of 0.90 normal saline were administered intravenously. During the next 30 minutes, tachypnea worsened and labored breathing, hypoxemia, and cyanosis developed. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nonrebreather face mask, resulting in an oxygen saturation of 83; then, oxygen was administered through a high-flow nasal cannula at a rate of 40 liters per minute. Intravenous doses of dexamethasone and vanco-mycin were given. During the following 40 minutes, the systolic blood pressure fell to 70 mm Hg and the dorsa-lis pedis pulses were noted to be weak. Approximately 110 minutes after the patients arrival at the other hospital, a triple-lumen central venous catheter was placed in the right femoral vein and a continuous intravenous infusion of norepineph-rine was initiated. After intravenous doses of midazolam, etomidate, and fentanyl were administered, tracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation with pressure-regulated volume control was begun, with a tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of body weight, a rate of 24 breaths per minute, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cm of water, and a fraction of inspired oxygen Fio2 of 100. A continuous infusion of propofol was begun. Hypotension persisted, and a diffuse purpu-ric rash developed. Approximately 2 hours after the patients arrival at the other hospital, a dose of piperacillintazobactam was administered, a 1-liter bolus of 0.45 normal saline with 150 meq of sodium bicarbonate was given, and a Foley catheter was inserted. Twenty minutes later, a continuous intravenous infusion of phenyleph-rine was added, followed 7 minutes later by a vasopressin infusion. The patient was transported by helicopter to the PICU of this hospital. On the patients admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained from family members. A friend who had eaten the same meal as the patient the evening before admission had vomited once shortly thereafter but had not become progressively ill. The patient had a history of anxiety and depression, as well as intermittent ear infections during childhood. He had no known drug allergies. He had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. He smoked two packs of cigarettes weekly, smoked marijuana daily, and drank two alcoholic beverages approximately 2 times per week. He used dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine recre-ationally but did not use other illicit drugs. The patient lived in northern New England with his mother, brother, and three cats but had been staying with a friend for 5 days before admission, during which time he had visited a beach along the ocean and a music venue. He worked part-time at a restaurant; he had not traveled recently or had any other exposure to animals or ill persons. His father had coronary artery disease, his mother had hypothyroidism, and his brother had had viral meningitis at 6 weeks of age. On examination, the patient was pharmacologically sedated. The temperature was 40.8C, the pulse 166 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/53 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95 while he was receiving mechanical ventilation with an Fio2 of 50. He opened his eyes occasionally. The pupils were equal and reactive to light. The femoral pulses were palpable, but the peripheral pulses were not palpable and the digits were cold. There was diffuse anasarca and oozing from venipuncture sites and from the site of central venous catheter insertion. A diffuse reticular purpuric rash was present on the face, chest, abdomen, back, arms, and legs, sparing the palms and soles Fig. 1. A Foley catheter was in place, without urine output. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiography revealed perihilar airspace and diffuse interstitial opacities and bilateral small, layering pleural effusions. Dr. Manuella Lahoud-Rahme: A transthoracic echo-cardiogram was obtained while the patient was receiving norepinephrine, epinephrine, and vaso-pressin. The left ventricle had moderate dysfunction with regional wall-motion abnormalities; septal motion was decreased, but apical motion appeared to be preserved. The right ventricle had mild-to-moderate dysfunction with underfilling. There was no pericardial effusion.

Two months later, the patient collided with another adolescent while he was playing soccer, and the episodes of headache and neck pain worsened. He rated the pain at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. Fifteen months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the pediatric clinic of another hospital. On examination, the pulse was 95 beats per minute and the blood pressure 117/78 mm Hg. There was mild tenderness in the area of the trapezius muscle. A radiograph of the cervical spine was normal. During the next 15 months, the patient was followed in the pediatric and neurology clinics of the other hospital. Ibuprofen, nortriptyline, sumatriptan, cyclobenzaprine, and diazepam were prescribed, but the headache did not abate. He underwent physical therapy, chiropractic adjustment, massage therapy, and acupuncture, but the symptoms persisted. Three months before this admission, nausea began to occur during the episodes of headache. The pain became more intense when the patient was lying down or was physically active, resulting in tunnel vision and vomiting; after he vomited, the pain became less intense. He was evaluated at the pediatric clinic of the other hospital. On examination, the pulse was 104 beats per minute and the blood pressure 128/80 mm Hg. At the recommendation of his physicians, the patient stopped participating in all sports. Two days before this admission, the pain worsened and awoke the patient from sleep. The nausea was constant, and the vomiting occurred two times per day. The patient was unable to attend school because of the symptoms. His parents took him to the pediatric clinic of the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.8C, the pulse 115 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 120/64 mm Hg. The height was 183.6 cm, and the body-mass index BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 27.0. The physical examination was normal. A probable diagnosis of mixed migraines and tension headaches was made. Prednisone, zolmitriptan, and ondansetron were prescribed, and the patient was sent home. On the day of this admission, the patient had new severe pain on the right side of the abdomen that awoke him from sleep. The headache, neck pain, and nausea were constant. The patient was taken to the emergency department of the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.8C, the pulse 160 beats per minute, the blood pressure 2391/62 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while he was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The white-cell count was 22,380 per microliter reference range at other hospital, 3800 to 10,500, the lactic acid level 2.7 mmol per liter 24 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter 5 to 20 mg per deciliter, and the creatinine level 1.3 mg per deciliter 115 mol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.3 mg per deciliter 53 to 115 mol per liter. An electrocardiogram ECG showed sinus tachycardia with increased R-wave and S-wave amplitudes in the precordial leads, as well as nonspecific repolarization abnormalities. One hour later, a repeat ECG showed an ectopic atrial rhythm with frequent premature ventricular contractions at a rate of 66 beats per minute. Intravenous hydromorphone, morphine, ondan-setron, metoclopramide, and lactated Ringers solution were administered. A nitroglycerin infusion was started, and the systolic blood pressure decreased to 143 mm Hg; the infusion was stopped, and the systolic blood pressure increased to 212 mm Hg. Intravenous labetalol was administered, and the systolic blood pressure decreased to 92 mm Hg. An esmolol infusion was started, and the patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit PICU of this hospital, arriving 3 hours after presentation to the other hospital. Shortly after his arrival, the esmolol infusion was stopped. On admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The patient had played paint-ball a few days earlier but did not recall any direct trauma to the chest or abdomen. A review of systems was notable for heat intolerance and night sweats. He had a history of acne and had received a diagnosis of pneumonia involving the right upper lobe 10 months before this admission. He had normal growth and development and had received all routine childhood vaccines. His medications included doxycycline and topical tretinoin, clindamycin, and benzoyl peroxide, in addition to zolmitriptan and ondansetron; he had not started taking the recently prescribed pred-nisone. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in a suburban area of New England with his parents and younger brother. He performed well in high school. Before the recent progression of his symptoms, he had participated in soccer, basketball, and track. He did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. He drank one or two alcoholic beverages per month. His father and paternal grandparents had hypertension, and his maternal aunts had migraines; his mother and brother were healthy. On examination, the temperature was 36.6C, the pulse 126 beats per minute, the blood pressure 90/44 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. He appeared tired, pale, and diaphoretic. He was in distress because of the pain; he spoke in brief sentences and had frequent hiccups. The abdomen was nondistended with marked tenderness in the right upper quadrant and right flank, with rebound and guarding. The skin was warm and clammy, and some inguinal hyperpigmentation was present. No cafe au lait spots were noted. The white-cell count was 27,140 per microliter reference range at this hospital, 4500 to 13,000, the lactic acid level 3.4 mmol per liter 31 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter 5 to 18 mg per deciliter, the creatinine level 1.64 mg per deciliter 145 mol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter 53 to 133 mol per liter, and the high-sensitivity troponin T level 188 ng per liter reference range, 0 to 14. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. On hospital day 2, urinalysis revealed 1 blood, trace ketones, a pH of 5.0, and a specific gravity of 1.015; microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed squamous cells, crystals, and mucin, as well as 3 to 5 hyaline casts per high-power field, less than 10 white cells per high-power field, and no red cells. A diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Pheochromocytoma. ", "prediction": "1. **Adrenal crisis**: The acute onset of severe abdominal pain, hypotension, and a history of heat intolerance and pigmentation changes suggest an adrenal insufficiency crisis.\n2. **Pheochromocytoma**: Episodes of severe headaches, hypertension, and a high level of catecholamines could indicate this adrenal tumor, especially given the fluctuating blood pressure.\n3. **Migraine with abdominal variant**: His persistent headaches accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain fits the profile of abdominal migraine that is compounded by his history of migraines.\n4. **Autonomic dysreflexia**: Given his involvement in a severe ATV accident and the presence of symptoms like episodic hypertension and nausea, this condition often seen in spinal cord injuries might be considered.\n5. **Hypertensive emergency**: Severe headaches, fluctuating blood pressure, and high troponin levels suggest the need to rule out acute hypertension crisis with possible target organ damage.\n6. **Acute pancreatitis**: Severe abdominal pain radiating to the back, elevated white-cell count, and recent onset of symptoms could suggest this diagnosis, although further investigation is required.\n7. **Traumatic brain injury/Chronic subdural hematoma**: Given his history of multiple head traumas and persistent headaches with neck pain, a delayed presentation of a subdural hematoma might be possible.\n8. **Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis**: The acute abdominal symptoms and marked tenderness may indicate peritonitis, especially considering the elevated white count and lactic acid levels.\n9. **Sepsis**: Elevated white-cell count, lactate level, creatinine, and systemic symptoms suggest a severe infection leading to systemic inflammatory response syndrome.\n10. **Renal vein thrombosis**: Abdominal pain with elevated creatinine and hematuria on urinalysis could indicate this vascular emergency, especially with the recent severe hypertensive episodes."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. James W. Luccarelli Psychiatry: A 70-year-old man with bipolar disorder was evaluated at this hospital because of depressed mood, suicidal ideation, and gait disturbance. The patient had a long history of depressive episodes, with two previous hospitalizations for suicide attempts. Approximately two decades before the current admission, he was struck on the head with a beam while working at a construction site and had a 4-cm laceration. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital, where the wound was sutured but no further evaluation was conducted. Approximately 10 years before the current admission, around the time of his mothers death, the patient was evaluated at this hospital because of an episode of irritability, a reduced need for sleep, and grandiosity; he reported feelings of transcendence and being at one with God. He was admitted for 1 month to the psychiatry unit of a second hospital, where he was treated with lithium and elec-troconvulsive therapy. Thereafter, he received outpatient psychiatric treatment on a monthly basis, as well as therapy with valproic acid and fluoxetine. Approximately 9 years before the current admission, the patient fell on concrete stairs and had back pain with subsequent lower-leg weakness and urinary incontinence. He was evaluated at a third hospital, where magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the lumbar spine revealed multilevel degenerative changes, including L4L5 spinal stenosis and central disk protrusion. Acetaminophen and physical therapy were prescribed. Five years later 4 years before the current admission, the patient fell because of an unsteady gait and was evaluated at a fourth hospital. Neurologic examination revealed a memory deficit with an inability to recall any objects after 5 minutes on the three-item object-recall test and poor attention with an inability to perform serial sevens calculations, as well as action tremor in the arms and mildly unsteady gait, even with the use of a cane. The remainder of the physical examination was reportedly normal. The complete blood count, results of renal function tests, and levels of electrolytes, valproic acid, folate, vitamin B12, glycated hemoglobin, and thyrotropin were normal; serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. MRI of the head reportedly revealed no evidence of an infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, or a mass but showed mild prominence of ventricles, sulci, and cisterns. The dose of fluoxetine was decreased, and the patient was discharged 3 days later. Additional falls occurred 2 months and 4 months later, and both times, the patient was evaluated at the fourth hospital. Two months after the most recent fall, he hit the car in front of him while driving. His psychiatrist noted that he had bilateral tremor at rest; the dose of val-proic acid was reduced, and he was referred to a neurologist. Two months after the car crash, he fell while walking and was evaluated at the fourth hospital. The evaluation was notable for nystagmus and a normal valproic acid level 89 g per milliliter; reference range, 50 to 100 despite the dose reduction; the doses of valproic acid and trazodone were reduced, and physical therapy was provided. During the next 5 months, gait instability was reduced but persisted. The patient was evaluated by two other neurologists after reporting a feeling of imbalance. Audiometry revealed mild-to-moderate high-frequency sensori-neural hearing loss. Medications were considered to be a contributor to his balance dysfunction. During the next 12 months, the dose of val-proic acid was tapered and fluoxetine was stopped; the patient underwent trials of escitalopram and then sertraline for the treatment of depressive symptoms. He reported to his psychiatrist symptoms of confusion, some difficulty with memory, and decreased leg coordination. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 23 scores range from 0 to 30, with a score of 18 to 25 suggesting mild cognitive impairment. Dr. McKinley Glover: Fifteen months before the current admission, the patient began to have dizziness. MRI of the head Fig. 1, performed at this hospital, revealed an old infarct in the left corona radiata, features of mild small-vessel disease, mild diffuse brain parenchymal volume loss, and mild ventricular prominence. Dr. Luccarelli: Neuropsychiatric testing was performed, and the results did not suggest a neurodegenerative process. Given the patient’s progressively depressed mood, treatment with aripiprazole was started, with the dose adjusted over the following 12 months. Three months before the current admission, the patient reported worsening depression, with hopelessness, guilt, and increased sleep. That month, his son found him unable to walk and requiring assistance to move. On examination, he had tremor and muscle rigidity; on ambulation, he had a shuffling gait and required a cane. Treatment with aripiprazole was stopped, benztropine was started, and sertraline was replaced by fluoxetine. One month before the current admission, the patient was voluntarily hospitalized in the psychiatry unit of this hospital because of worsening depression, which he attributed to the progressive reduction in mobility and strength. He reported 3 weeks of frequent early morning awakenings, anhedonia, low energy, anorexia, difficulty concentrating, and low motivation, such that he had not paid bills or bathed. Examination was notable for tremor, muscle rigidity, and a shuffling gait. Blood levels of folate, vitamin B12, and glycated hemoglobin were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 antibodies and type 1 antigen and for antitreponemal antibodies were negative. Over the 5-day hospitalization, the dose of fluoxetine was increased and treatment with lurasidone was started. During the following 4 weeks, the patient’s ability to walk continued to deteriorate, and he required intermittent use of a walker and a wheelchair. His depressive symptoms persisted, and after he reported thoughts of suicide and feeling unsafe to his psychiatrist, he was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit of this hospital. A review of systems was notable for malaise, anorexia, poor sleep, anhedonia, hopelessness, guilt, low energy, worsening gait, and chronic joint pain; he reported no recent falls or manic symptoms. The patient’s psychiatric history included bipolar depression with suicide attempts and multiple psychiatric admissions, obsessive–compulsive disorder, and skin picking. His medical history was notable for long-standing urinary incontinence, hypertension, and sleep apnea; he had undergone laser ablation of the prostate 4 years earlier, as well as bilateral inguinal hernia repair and rotator cuff repair. Medications at the time of admission included fluoxetine, lurasidone, valproic acid, aspirin, and lisinopril, as well as lorazepam and trazodone as needed. Lithium had caused tremor, aripiprazole had caused muscle rigidity and tremor, and gabapentin had caused grogginess. The patient did not smoke tobacco, and he drank alcohol less than once monthly; he had previously smoked marijuana several times daily but had been abstinent for 2 years. He was retired from employment as a laborer. He was divorced and resided in an assisted-living facility. His family history was notable for major depression in his mother and bipolar disorder in one of his children. The temperature was 36.1°C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 110//61 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.5. The patient was wheelchair-bound. He was described as well-groomed and cooperative, with appropriate eye contact. He was oriented to time, place, and person. His speech was fluent and indicated a logical thought process but was considered to be “slow.” Some of his responses seemed slow, but naming, repetition, attention, concentration, and memory were intact. His mood and affect were described as depressed, and he had suicidal ideation. Results of cranial nerve examination were normal, except for reduced facial expression. Motor examination showed mildly increased tone in the lower legs and left arm, with bradykinesia, and was otherwise normal. The gait was described as being “slow to start” with a “magnetic quality” and then as “shuffling” for a few steps. The remainder of the neurologic and general physical examinations was normal. The white-cell count, platelet count, and levels of hemoglobin, calcium, and albumin were normal, as were results of liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Glover: MRI of the head (Figure 2), performed with and without the administration of contrast material, revealed the old infarct in the left corona radiata, features of mild small-vessel disease, and mild diffuse brain parenchymal volume loss with prominence of the ventricles and sylvian fissures. There was no abnormal enhancement. Coronal reformatted images showed a callosal angle (the angle at which the two lateral ventricles meet at the level of the posterior commissure) of 66 degrees. Dr. Luccarelli: Diagnostic tests were performed. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Normal pressure hydrocephalus. ", "prediction": "1. Parkinson's Disease: The patient presents with tremor, bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, and a shuffling gait, all of which are hallmark symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\n2. Bipolar Disorder: The patient's long history of depressive episodes, manias, and multiple psychiatric admissions strongly suggests a bipolar disorder.\n3. Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH): The magnetic gait, cognitive decline, urinary incontinence, and MRI findings of ventricular prominence are consistent with NPH.\n4. Depression with Suicidal Ideation: The patient's persistently depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, and recent suicidal thoughts indicate severe depression.\n5. Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms: The patient's history of various psychotropic medications, known to cause tremor and muscle rigidity, supports this diagnosis.\n6. Dementia with Lewy Bodies: The patient exhibits cognitive fluctuations, detailed visual hallucinations, and parkinsonian motor symptoms, which are characteristic of this neurodegenerative condition.\n7. Small Vessel Disease: The MRI findings of mild small-vessel disease along with the patient's dizziness and cognitive decline suggest cerebrovascular contributions.\n8. Stroke Sequelae: The old infarct in the left corona radiata on MRI may account for some motor deficits and the history of gait disturbances.\n9. Medication Overuse or Polypharmacy: The patient's extensive medication history, including psychotropic and other medications, could contribute to his symptoms.\n10. Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE): Considering his head trauma history and subsequent cognitive and motor declines, CTE remains a differential diagnosis."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. P. Connor Johnson Medicine: A 39-year-old woman presented to this hospital with fever, flank pain, and tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. The patient had been in her usual state of health until approximately 4 weeks before admission, when she noted tender bilateral inguinal swelling. Two days later, she began to have sharp, intermittent flank pain on the right side; she rated the pain at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. During the next 3 days, she had nausea and a poor appetite. She noted foul-smelling urine but had no dysuria, urinary frequency, or hematuria. Three weeks before admission, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician. On examination, the temperature was 36.6C, and she appeared well. There was costovertebral and abdominal tenderness on the right side, without rebound or guarding. The external genitalia were normal. Copious thin, white vaginal discharge was present; no cervical motion tenderness was noted, and the ovaries were normal on palpation. Multiple bilateral tender inguinal lymph nodes, measuring up to 2 cm in diameter, were noted on palpation. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. On microscopic examination of the vaginal discharge, clue cells were observed, but there were no fungal elements or trichomo-nads. Nucleic acid amplification tests of a cervical swab for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were negative. A blood test for IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies to C. trachomatis serovars L1 and D through K was negative. Urinalysis revealed leukocyte esterase and nitrates; urine was obtained for culture. Vaginal metroni-dazole gel was prescribed. Two days later, the urine culture grew more than 100,000 colony-forming units CFU of Escherichia coli per milliliter and 10,000 to 100,000 CFU of Klebsiella pneu-moniae per milliliter. A 14-day course of trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole was prescribed. The inguinal swelling reportedly abated, but the flank pain and nausea persisted. Two days after the patient completed the prescribed course of trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, fever and night sweats developed. After 3 days of fever with a temperature of up to 38.5C, she began vomiting and subsequently presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing flank pain, malaise, nausea, and poor appetite with weight loss of 2.3 kg during the past month. There was no sore throat, cough, or diarrhea. She had a history of hypothyroidism, asthma, bipolar disorder, dysmenorrhea, and migraines. She had had multiple urinary tract infections; pyelonephritis had been diagnosed 4 years before this presentation. A copper intrauterine device had been inserted 6 months before this presentation. Medications included albuterol, budesonideformoterol, divalproex, levothyroxine, loratadine, and sumatriptan as needed for migraines. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She had immigrated to the United States from Brazil 1 year earlier; she had been living in New England during the past year and had been working in a laboratory. She had recently spent 3 months in Brazil visiting her husband and had returned to New England shortly before she noted inguinal swelling. While in Brazil, she had remained in a large city and had not visited any remote locations. In New England, she lived alone with one kitten and one full-grown cat. There was no family history of cancer. An aunt had died from tuberculosis, but the patient had had only minimal contact with her aunt. On examination, the temperature was 36.6C, the blood pressure 100/63 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 67.5 kg and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 24.4. The patient appeared ill. The right side of the abdomen was tender on palpation, without rebound or guarding. Hepatosplenomegaly was not present. Tender bilateral inguinal lymph nodes were noted. No palpable cervical, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, or axillary lymphadenopathy was noted. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. A urine test for human chorionic gonado-tropin was negative. Blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, creatine kinase, and lactate dehy-drogenase were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. Blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus HIV type 1 p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 were negative, as was an interferon- release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Madeleine Sertic: Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis Fig. 1, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilateral inguinal lymph-adenopathy, with the largest node, on the right side, measuring 2.6 cm in greatest dimension. A right pelvic sidewall lymph node measuring 1.3 cm in greatest dimension, a gastrohepatic lymph node measuring 0.9 cm in greatest dimension, and lymphadenopathy in the porta hepatis were also seen. Transvaginal ultrasonography revealed an intrauterine device in an appropriate position, normal ovaries, and trace free fluid in the pelvis. Dr. Johnson: Intravenous fluids and intramuscular ketorolac were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Bartonella henselae infection (cat scratch disease). ", "prediction": "1. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID): Despite negative cervical motion tenderness, the patient's symptoms and the presence of an intrauterine device could result in PID with associated lymphadenopathy and imaging findings.\n2. Pyelonephritis: Given the history of multiple UTIs, foul-smelling urine, flank pain, and the recent positive urine culture for E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, pyelonephritis remains a likely diagnosis.\n3. Cat Scratch Disease: Considering the patient's exposure to cats, inguinal lymphadenopathy, and fever, cat scratch disease caused by Bartonella henselae should be considered.\n4. Tuberculosis: Though the interferon-γ release assay was negative, extrapulmonary tuberculosis, particularly in a patient with a history of contact, could explain the lymphadenopathy and constitutional symptoms.\n5. Lymphoma: Persistent fever, weight loss, night sweats, and lymphadenopathy could suggest a diagnosis of lymphoma, warranting further hematologic evaluation.\n6. CMV Infection: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection can present with fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, and liver involvement consistent with imaging findings.\n7. HIV Seroconversion Syndrome: Early HIV infection can present with lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms; however, the negative HIV test results reduce this likelihood.\n8. Acute Viral Hepatitis: Considered due to systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy, though normal liver function tests make this less likely.\n9. Inguinal Lymphogranuloma Venereum (LGV): Although rare in this context, LGV can present with inguinal lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms.\n10. Endocarditis: Persistent fever, weight loss, and a history of intravenous drug use or cardiac conditions would warrant consideration, though not indicated in this specific case context."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Carolina Chiou Ophthalmology: A 78-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of a rash on the forehead and frontal scalp and edema of the left eyelids. The patient had been well until 3 days before presentation, when pressurelike pain developed in the left side of the forehead and frontal scalp and the bilateral maxillary sinuses and upper jaws. He described the pain as similar to previous episodes of sinusitis. He was evaluated in the primary care clinic of another hospital, and treatment with oral clindamycin was started for a presumed diagnosis of sinusitis. Two days before presentation, the patient noted erythema and small reddish-brown skin lesions on the left side of the forehead and frontal scalp. His barber had pointed out a similar spot on the top of his scalp 2 weeks earlier. The skin lesions were not painful or itchy, and he did not seek medical evaluation. On the day of presentation, the patient awoke from sleep and noted redness and swelling of the left eyelids. The skin lesions on the left side of the forehead and frontal scalp had increased in number, and some were covered with hemorrhagic crust. There was pain with movement of the left eye and blurry vision. Over the course of several hours, the swelling of the left eyelids worsened and the patient was unable to fully open the left eye. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported no ocular or nasal discharge, no changes in taste or hearing, and no jaw claudication. He had not recently changed his shampoo or been in a pool or hot tub. He had a history of recurrent sinus infection, allergic rhinitis, depression, benign prostatic hyperplasia, hypogonadism, and restless legs syndrome. He had received a diagnosis of rectal cancer 15 years earlier, which had led to partial colectomy, as well as a diagnosis of testicular cancer 50 years earlier, which had led to orchiectomy and radiation therapy. His ocular history included bilateral mild ptosis; he had undergone bilateral cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation. Medications included finasteride, tamsu-losin, carbidopalevodopa, nasal azelastine and fluticasone, and topical testosterone. Levofloxacin, cefaclor, and sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim had caused a rash. The patient was a retired engineer and lived with his wife in a coastal community of New England. He had previously smoked a pipe but had quit 30 years earlier. He drank a quarter glass of wine daily. His family history included skin cancer in his maternal grandmother and macular degeneration in his sister. On examination, the temperature was 38.1C, the blood pressure 122/58 mm Hg, and the heart rate 74 beats per minute. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 31.9. Visual acuity without glasses was 2040 in the right eye and 2050 in the left eye. Results of Ishihara color testing were normal. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light; there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular movements were full. There was complete ptosis of the left upper eyelid, along with erythema and edema of left upper and lower lids. There was mild ptosis of the right upper lid. There was no proptosis. The intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg in both eyes. Slit-lamp examination revealed diffuse con-junctival injection and inferior chemosis in the left eye. The corneas were clear, and no cells were visualized in the anterior chambers. Results of dilated fundoscopic examination were normal. There was prominent erythema affecting the forehead, left side of the anterior scalp, and left eyelids. Multiple coalescing erosions covered with hemorrhagic and serous crust were seen at sites of erythema, mainly affecting the left side of the forehead and extending to the midline, the frontal scalp, and the left upper eyelid. Erosions and erythema affected the right side of the forehead, as well, but to a much lesser extent. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory evaluation revealed a blood sodium level of 125 mmol per liter reference range, 135 to 145. Results of kidney- and liver-function tests were normal. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Hillary R. Kelly: Computed tomography CT of the head and face Fig. 1, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed marked swelling affecting the soft tissue over the left orbit and frontal sinus and extending superiorly along the superficial soft tissue of the frontal scalp, predominantly on the left side. The globe, orbit, and retrobulbar soft tissue were normal. The right maxillary sinus showed nearly complete opacification with wall thickening and sclerosis, findings consistent with chronic inflammation and sinusitis. There was a defect in the medial wall of the right maxillary sinus that was consistent with previous sinus surgery. The other paranasal sinuses, including the left maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinuses, and sphenoid sinuses, were well aerated. Dr. Chiou: Empirical treatment with valacyclo-vir, amoxicillinclavulanate, and topical bacitra-cinpolymyxin B was started. The next day, the edema and erythema of the left eyelids worsened, and there was new edema and erythema of the right eyelids. The patient was unable to open his eyes. He began to have visual hallucinations, and his wife noted that he was confused. The skin lesions on the left side of the forehead were unchanged, and new round punched-out erosions with overlying hemorrhagic crust were present on the right side of the forehead Fig. 2. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and acyclovir was started. A diagnostic test was performed.

Acute Sinusitis with Orbital Involvement: Given his history and CT findings, sinusitis could cause orbital symptoms due to adjacent inflammation or infection spread.\n4. Erysipelas: An acute bacterial skin infection involving the upper dermis and superficial lymphatics commonly caused by Streptococcus, which could present as a well-demarcated erythematous rash.\n5. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome: The presence of extensive erythema, coalescing erosions, and past sensitivities to antibiotics raises the possibility of a severe drug reaction.\n6. Allergic Contact Dermatitis: Though less likely given the systemic involvement, recent changes in skincare products or medications could incite an allergic skin reaction.\n7. Seborrheic Dermatitis: The location of the rash on the forehead and scalp could point towards a chronic form of dermatitis, which can flare under stress or illness.\n8. Orbital Cellulitis: The symptoms of worsening eyelid edema, erythema, and visual disturbances suggest a possible severe infection involving the eye orbit.\n9. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE): Though less likely, given the rash, and systemic symptoms including new confusion, this autoimmune condition could be a differential.\n10.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Katherine A. Sparger: A newborn girl was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of this hospital after a planned delivery by cesarean section because of a neck mass. During pregnancy, the patients mother was 41 years old gravida 3, para 1 and received prenatal care at another hospital. At 7 weeks of gestation, vaginal bleeding occurred because of a subchorionic hematoma. At 10 weeks of gestation, the mothers blood thyrotropin level was 0.01 U per milliliter reference range, 0.40 to 5.00; levels of free thyroxine free T4 and total triiodothyronine total T3 were not obtained. At 19 weeks of gestation, the thyrotropin level was 0.44 U per milliliter and an ultrasonographic survey of the fetal anatomy was normal. During the third trimester, gestational diabetes was diagnosed; glycemic control was maintained with dietary changes. Four weeks before delivery, at 34 weeks 6 days of gestation, a routine transvaginal ultrasonographic survey of fetal growth revealed a new mass on the right side of the fetuss neck that measured 2.6 cm by 3.4 cm by 3.0 cm. The mother was referred to the obstetrics clinic of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Dr. Randheer Shailam: At 35 weeks 6 days of gestation, obstetrical ultrasonography performed at this hospital Fig. 1A confirmed the presence of a 4.6cm mass on the right side of the neck. The mass was hyperechoic and well circumscribed and had internal vascularity; the remainder of the survey of fetal anatomy was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the fetus, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material Fig. 1B, 1C, and 1D, revealed displacement of the trachea without compression. Dr. Sparger: For multiple weeks, the fetal biophysical profile score was 8 out of 8, indicating normal breathing motion, movement, tone, and amniotic fluid volume. The mother met with providers from MaternalFetal Medicine, Pediatric Surgery, Pediatric Otolaryngology, and Neonatology to discuss the plan for delivery and neonatal airway management at birth, including the possibility of an ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure. The mother initially had a preference for a vaginal delivery, given her history of a successful vaginal delivery with a previous pregnancy. However, after conversations with Maternal–Fetal Medicine providers, the decision was made to proceed with a scheduled cesarean section at 39 weeks of gestation to minimize the risks of labor dystocia and asynclitism due to fetal neck position and any associated birth trauma, as well as to allow for controlled timing of the delivery with multidisciplinary team members present. The mother had a history of anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and known mutations in both copies of the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Eleven years earlier, her first pregnancy had ended at full term with a vaginal delivery. Three years earlier, her second pregnancy had ended at 13 weeks of gestation with elective termination because of the diagnosis of pentalogy of Cantrell (a syndrome of midline abdominal and chest wall defects, including ectopia cordis and omphalocele). During her current pregnancy, she had taken prenatal vitamins, cholecalciferol, and pyridoxine, as well as lorazepam as needed for anxiety. Prenatal screening tests were negative for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis B; equivocal for immunity to rubella; and positive for group B streptococcal colonization. The patient (baby) had a healthy father and sister. Her family history included hypothyroidism in her maternal grandmother, sleep apnea in her paternal grandfather, and diabetes in her paternal grandmother. In addition, her maternal aunt had thyrotoxicosis, a paternal uncle had diabetes, and another paternal uncle had blindness, deafness, and cognitive developmental delay. At 39 weeks of gestation, the baby was delivered by cesarean section. The birth weight was 3060 g (35th percentile), the length 48 cm (26th percentile), and the head circumference 34.5 cm (60th percentile). She had a spontaneous cry, decreased tone, and spontaneous respirations. There was a large firm mass on the right side of the neck. The 1-minute Apgar score was 6. At 3 minutes of life, increased work of breathing developed; treatment with continuous positive airway pressure of 5 cm of water was administered. At 5 minutes of life, the Apgar score was 7 but the increased work of breathing worsened, with nasal flaring, grunting, and subcostal retractions; the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) was increased to 100%. At 10 minutes of life, the Apgar score was 8. Direct laryngoscopy revealed deviation of the trachea, larynx, subglottis, and right piriform sinus. Tracheal intubation was performed with rigid bronchoscopy; because of clinically significant airway obstruction, tracheostomy was performed. At 8 hours of life, the blood hemoglobin level was 10.0 g per deciliter (reference range for neonates, 13.5 to 19.5), the thyrotropin level 3.82 μU per milliliter, the alpha-fetoprotein level 107,048.0 ng per milliliter (reference range, <7.9), and the beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level 7.3 IU per milliliter (reference range, <50.0). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Shailam: On ultrasonography of the head and neck (Figure 2A), the mass on the right side of the neck measured 3.7 cm by 3.8 cm by 3.1 cm and was markedly hypervascular, with lateral displacement of the internal jugular vein and carotid artery. On MRI and magnetic resonance angiography of the neck, performed with and without the intravenous administration of contrast material (Figure 2B and 2C), the mass appeared to arise from the sympathetic chain. Dr. Sparger: During the first week of life, the vital signs remained normal, except for intermittent oxygen desaturation events while the patient was breathing through a humidified tracheostomy mask (Fio2, 21%); these desaturations resolved rapidly without intervention. The weight increased along the 30th percentile. A diagnostic procedure was performed. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Nodular follicular thyroid neoplasm with a so­matic NRAS mutation. ", "prediction": "1. Congenital Cervical Teratoma: The large, firm, hyperechoic mass with internal vascularity found on ultrasonography and MRI of the neck is consistent with the presentation of a teratoma, a common neck mass in neonates.\n2. Neuroblastoma: The mass arising from the sympathetic chain and the presence of elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels could suggest a neuroblastoma, a malignant tumor commonly affecting infants.\n3. Lymphatic Malformation (Cystic Hygroma): A well-circumscribed, cystic, and hypervascular mass in the neck could indicate a lymphatic malformation which often presents prenatally or at birth.\n4. Congenital Goiter: Given the family history of thyroid dysfunction and the identified mass, a congenital goiter due to thyroid dysgenesis or dyshormonogenesis is a possibility.\n5. Hemangioma: The hypervascular nature of the mass and the rapid postnatal growth could be indicative of a hemangioma, a benign vascular tumor commonly seen in the head and neck region of infants.\n6. Thyroglossal Duct Cyst: A midline neck mass that causes displacement of the trachea, increasing work of breathing, and airway obstruction might involve a thyroglossal duct cyst.\n7. Branchial Cleft Cyst: A congenital neck mass that is well-circumscribed and hypervascular could be a branchial cleft cyst, resulting from incomplete obliteration of branchial clefts.\n8. Rhabdomyosarcoma: The hypervascular nature and location of the mass could also suggest rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare malignant tumor arising from embryonic mesenchymal cells.\n9. Infantile Myofibromatosis: The firm consistency and vascular characteristics of the mass could be consistent with infantile myofibromatosis, a benign tumor of fibrous tissue.\n10. Cervical Lymphadenopathy: Although less likely, a markedly hypervascular and enlarged lymph node due to an infectious or inflammatory process must be considered, given the presentation and family history."}

Miller Medicine: A 64-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital in early winter with fever and pancytopenia. The patient, who had multiple sclerosis, had been in her usual state of health until 7 months before admission, when nausea and fatigue developed. Over the next 2 months, these symptoms worsened, and in the context of severe nausea, two episodes of vasovagal syncope occurred. During an evaluation for syncope, anemia was noted. Five months before admission, the patient was evaluated by her primary care provider at another hospital. The weight was 87.6 kg, and the results of physical examination were normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, cobala-min, folate, iron, iron saturation, and total iron-binding capacity were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Iron supplementation was prescribed. Nausea and fatigue persisted. Three months before admission, the patient was again evaluated by her primary care provider at the other hospital. The weight was 84.4 kg; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed cholelithiasis and splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 17 cm in the craniocaudal dimension normal value, 12 cm. Two and a half months before admission, the patient was evaluated in a hematology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. She reported persistent nausea and fatigue, poor appetite with reduced oral intake, and 2 weeks of dyspnea on exertion. There was no orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The weight was 83.2 kg, and the spleen tip was palpable four fingerbreadths below the costal margin; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. A bone marrow biopsy was performed, and examination of the bone marrow specimen revealed mildly hypercel-lular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and mild dyserythropoiesis. Treatment with prednisone and folic acid was begun. Ocrelizumab infusions for multiple sclerosis were stopped. Nausea and fatigue persisted, and fevers and sweats developed. After 3 weeks of treatment with prednisone, the anemia had not abated and the patient had temperatures as high as 39.0C. Testing for influenza A and B viruses was negative. Two units of packed red cells were transfused. The course of prednisone was tapered off over the next 18 days, and the patient was referred to a hematologist affiliated with this hospital. In the hematology clinic, the patient reported that the fevers had resolved but the fatigue, weakness, and poor appetite had worsened. She felt too fatigued to walk, and she had recently had a fall without loss of consciousness. The weight was 82.4 kg; splenomegaly was present, and the remainder of the examination was unchanged. The patient was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. In addition to relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis, there was a history of trigeminal neuralgia, restless legs syndrome, vasovagal syncope when blood samples were obtained, and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level for 1 year without a clear cause. Medications included oxcar-bazepine, gabapentin, ropinirole, folic acid, and cholecalciferol. There were no known drug allergies. The patient had quit smoking 20 years earlier and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She lived in a suburban area of New England with her adult son and pet cat and dog. Her backyard adjoined a large wooded area where deer were often seen. She worked in health care administration. Her family history included diabetes in her mother, lung cancer in her father, and multiple sclerosis in her sister. On examination, the patient appeared pale but not unwell. The temperature was 38.3C, the blood pressure 90/54 mm Hg, the heart rate 93 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93 while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 79.8 kg and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 32.2. The conjunctivae were pale. The heart rate was regular, with normal first and second heart sounds S1 and S2 and a soft systolic murmur. There was edema in the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of homocysteine, methylmalonic acid, arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury were normal, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis and coagulation tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Two units of packed red cells were transfused, and one dose of intravenous furosemide was administered. Intravenous methylprednisolone was administered daily for 3 days, and the patient reported a decrease in weakness and fatigue. Dr. Dexter P. Mendoza: On hospital day 4, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis Fig. 1A revealed splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 19 cm in the craniocaudal dimension. Concurrent positron-emission tomography with injection of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Fig. 1B revealed intense uptake in the spleen and diffuse uptake in the bone marrow throughout the axial and appen-dicular skeleton. Dr. Miller: On hospital day 5, the patient reported a recurrence of severe fatigue and generalized weakness. The temperature was 39.0C and the heart rate 130 beats per minute.

Medford: A 76-year-old woman with heart failure and type 2 diabetes mel-litus was admitted to this hospital with nausea, diarrhea, and acute kidney failure. The patient normally lived independently, but she had been staying in a skilled nursing facility for the past several weeks to recover from a recent humeral fracture. During her stay, nausea, abdominal cramps, and nonbloody diarrhea developed. The next day, the symptoms persisted, and she was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital. Approximately 3 months before the current admission, the patient was admitted to this hospital with respiratory failure due to an exacerbation of heart failure and pneumonia. She was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline for 5 days, and diuretic agents were adjusted during a 3-week hospitalization. Nine weeks before the current admission, the patients condition returned to baseline, and she was discharged home with instructions to continue a diuretic regimen of torsemide and spironolactone. The patients dry weight was 127 kg. Laboratory test results at the time of discharge are shown in Table 1. Four weeks before the current admission, the patient lost her balance while walking and fell onto her right side. She had no loss of consciousness, chest pain, or other symptoms. She was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital and reported pain in her right arm. On examination, there were abrasions and bruising over the right elbow, with tenderness on palpation; the weight was 123 kg. The right radial pulse was normal, and sensation was intact in the arm and hand. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Radiography of the right arm showed a mild transcondylar fracture of the right distal humerus. A splint was placed, and the patient was advised not to bear weight with the right arm. She was discharged to a skilled nursing facility for increased support with daily activities while she was recovering. Two weeks before the current admission, while the patient was staying in the skilled nursing facility, edema developed in both legs, and her weight increased by 5 kg. She attributed the weight gain to increased salt intake. Nine days before the current admission, oral metolazone was added to her diuretic regimen, and the leg edema resolved. At the time of the current admission, the patient reported nausea and abdominal cramps. She reported no fever, chills, cough, dyspnea, dysuria, flank pain, or vomiting. She had no known sick contacts. Her medical history included hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obstructive sleep apnea, for which nightly treatment with continuous positive airway pressure had been prescribed. Medications included allopurinol, amiodarone, aspirin, atorvastatin, cyclobenzap-rine, enoxaparin, fluticasone, glipizide, loratadine, lorazepam, metformin, metolazone, metoprolol, sertraline, spironolactone, torsemide, warfarin, and zolpidem. The last doses of metolazone, spironolactone, and torsemide were taken more than 24 hours before admission. There were no known drug allergies. Before the recent humeral fracture, the patient had been living alone in an urban area of New England; she required assistance from home health services for bathing and chores and used a walker for ambulation. She did not smoke tobacco or drink alcohol. She had no recent history of travel, and her family history was unremarkable. On examination, the patient appeared well, without respiratory distress. The temperature was 36.7C, the blood pressure 137/63 mm Hg, the heart rate 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 126 kg. The oral mucous membranes were dry. The heart sounds were normal, as were the breath sounds throughout both lung fields. There was no edema in the lower legs. The right arm was in a splint. The blood level of creatinine was 7.66 mg per deciliter 677 mol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter 53 to 133 mol per liter, and the level of lactic acid was 7.4 mmol per liter 67 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter 4.5 to 18 mg per deciliter. Urinalysis by dipstick showed a pH of 5.0 reference range, 5.0 to 9.0 and a specific gravity of 1.012 reference range, 1.001 to 1.035, and no protein, blood, nitrites, leukocyte esterase, glucose, or ketones were present. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiography revealed mild pulmonary interstitial edema. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and urinary tract revealed simple cysts in the left kidney, with no evidence of hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis. Intravenous fluids were administered, and a diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Lactic acidosis due to toxic effects from metfor-min use. ", "prediction": "1.

Acute tubular necrosis: The elevated lactic acid level and recent history of hypotension from her fall and fracture raise suspicion for ATN as a possible diagnosis.\n4. Heart failure exacerbation: The history of heart failure, recent weight gain, and mild pulmonary interstitial edema on radiography suggest fluid overload from an exacerbation of heart failure.\n5. Gastroenteritis: Nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps in a patient recently staying in a skilled nursing facility point towards an infectious etiology for gastrointestinal symptoms.\n6. Drug-induced nephrotoxicity: The combination of ceftriaxone, spironolactone, and other medications may contribute to acute renal impairment through nephrotoxicity.\n7. Clostridium difficile infection: A recent antibiotic treatment and nonbloody diarrhea raise concerns for C. difficile colitis, especially in a nursing facility setting.\n8. Lactic acidosis: Elevated lactic acid levels could be due to metformin use, especially in the context of acute kidney injury or dehydration.\n9. Urinary tract infection: Although the patient has no dysuria or fever, the patient's immobility and altered mental status can still render them susceptible to UTIs.\n10. Hyperkalemia: With the patient's use of spironolactone and potential acute kidney injury, there is a risk of developing hyperkalemia, which should be monitored closely."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Adam Tanious Surgery: A 37-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of abdominal pain and aortic dilatation. The patient had been well until 3 weeks before the current admission, when she began to have pain in the right side of the abdomen that radiated to the back. She also had nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills. Approximately 2 weeks before the current admission, she sought evaluation at the emergency department of another hospital. Physical examination was notable for pain with palpation of all four quadrants. The pulses were normal, and the blood pressure did not differ substantially between the two arms or between the two legs. The white-cell count was 9800 per microliter reference range at the other hospital, 4800 to 10,000, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 41 mm per hour reference range, 0 to 20, and the C-reactive protein level 44.0 mg per liter reference range, 0 to 10.0. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood specimens were obtained for two sets of bacterial cultures, with each set consisting of an aerobic bottle and an anaerobic bottle. Dr. Patrick D. Sutphin: Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed soft-tissue density adjacent to the infrarenal abdominal aorta and mild-to-moderate associated periaortic fat stranding Fig. 1A and 1B. These findings prompted CT angiography, performed 1 hour later, which more clearly delineated infrarenal abdominal aortic wall thickening at the level of the inferior mesenteric artery, with an aortic diameter of 2.3 cm Fig. 1C. Dr. Tanious: The patient was discharged from the emergency department of the other hospital on the same day, with a referral to the rheumatology clinic of that hospital and instructions to start treatment with prednisone. One day after discharge, one of the four culture bottles grew gram-positive bacilli, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital for investigation. After an evaluation, the positive culture was presumed to be contaminated. Additional blood specimens were obtained for culture, and the patient was discharged home on the second hospital day. The fever and chills resolved, and the abdominal pain abated initially but then gradually worsened. Eight days after discharge and 3 days before the current admission, the patient returned to the emergency department of the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.8C, the pulse 50 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 146/78 mm Hg. Physical examination was notable for diffuse abdominal tenderness, which was worse with deep palpation in all four quadrants. The white-cell count was 32,800 per microliter, the platelet count 565,000 per micro-liter reference range, 140,000 to 440,000, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 18 mm per hour, and the C-reactive protein level 110.0 mg per liter. The urinalysis was normal; urine toxicologic screening was positive for amphetamines, canna-binoids, and opiates. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Sutphin: CT angiography revealed progression of aortic wall thickening and periaortic fat stranding and interval narrowing of the proximal segment of the inferior mesenteric artery, with an increase in the aortic diameter to 3.1 cm. Dr. Tanious: The patient was admitted to the other hospital for a second time. Intravenous fluids, methylprednisolone, and heparin were administered, as was empirical treatment with vancomycin and piperacillintazobactam. During the next 3 days, the patient remained afebrile. Consultations with the rheumatology, infectious diseases, and vascular surgery departments were requested. Dr. Sutphin: On the second hospital day, magnetic resonance angiography of the abdomen revealed an increase in aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta aortic diameter, 3.6 cm with enhancement of the aortic wall. On the fourth hospital day, CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a further increase in aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta aortic diameter, 3.9 cm with increasing luminal irregularity and periaortic fat stranding. Dr. Tanious: The patient was transferred to this hospital for additional treatment. On evaluation, she reported abdominal pain that was worst in the right upper quadrant and radiated to the right lower quadrant, back, and chest. She rated the pain as 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. She also reported nausea but had not had fevers or chills since before the initial presentation. A review of systems was notable for the absence of fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, myalgias, joint pain, and rash; blue fingertips occurred with exposure to cold. Dr. Sutphin: CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed evidence of continued aneu-rysmal enlargement and increased luminal irregularity Fig. 1D, 1E, and 1F. Dr. Tanious: The patient had a history of poly-cystic ovary syndrome, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficithyperactivity disorder, asthma, and Chiari I malformation, which had led to suboccipital craniectomy 3 years earlier. She had undergone cesarean section 5 years earlier. Medications included prednisone, cloni-dine, promethazine, dicyclomine, and inhaled albuterol; latex had caused a rash. The patient was White, lived in an urban area of New England, and had recently been homeless. She had injected heroin for the past 5 years; her last injection had been 3 weeks earlier. She had a history of marijuana use and reported no methamphetamine use. Sexual history was not obtained. She drank four alcoholic beverages and smoked one pack of cigarettes daily. Her sister had rheumatoid arthritis, her grandmother had tuberculosis, and several family members had hypermobility of the joints. On examination, the patient was uncomfortable because of the abdominal pain. The abdomen was soft, with diffuse tenderness that was worst in the right upper quadrant and both lower quadrants. She did not have any ulcers, rash, lymphadenopathy, or warmth, redness, or swelling of the joints; the elbows and metacar-pophalangeal joints were hyperextensible. The white-cell count was 27,710 per microliter reference range at this hospital, 4500 to 11,000, the platelet count 576,000 per microliter reference range, 150,000 to 400,000, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 57 mm per hour reference range, 0 to 20, and the C-reactive protein level 60.6 mg per liter reference range, 0 to 8.0. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 was negative. Serologic testing for hepatitis C virus was positive. The blood-culture isolate detected at the other hospital was identified as bacillus species, and all other blood cultures performed at the other hospital showed no growth. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Management decisions were made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and infection of a vascular graft. ", "prediction": "1. Infectious aortitis: Given the patient's history of intravenous drug use, fever, marked inflammatory markers, and progressive dilation of the abdominal aorta, infectious aortitis, potentially from a gram-positive bacillus, is highly likely.\n2. Takayasu arteritis: The presence of aortic thickening, systemic symptoms, elevated inflammatory markers, and pulse differences without substantial blood pressure discrepancies suggests this large-vessel vasculitis.\n3. Syphilitic aortitis: Although less common, tertiary syphilis can lead to aortic aneurysms and should be considered given the patient's risk factors and findings.\n4. Aortic aneurysm development secondary to atherosclerosis: The patient's smoking history and evidence of progressive aneurysmal dilation might indicate this common cause of aortic aneurysm.\n5. Polymyalgia rheumatica: The patient's symptoms, elevated inflammatory markers, and recent prednisone usage could align with this diagnosis, particularly in the context of a heightened ESR and CRP.\n6. Abdominal tuberculosis involving the aorta: The family history of tuberculosis, as well as the patient's high inflammatory markers and abdominal symptoms, makes this a consideration.\n7. Marfan syndrome or other connective tissue disorders: Given the family history of joint hypermobility and the patient's aortic involvement, a connective tissue disorder causing aortic dilation is possible.\n8. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Heritable connective tissue disorders, which run in families and involve joint hypermobility and vascular complications, are possible diagnoses given the family history.\n9. Infected emboli from hepatobiliary sources: Considering the liver's proximity and the presence of the aortic pathology, embolic phenomena secondary to an infected focus, e.g., hepatic abscess, might be involved.\n10. Inflammatory bowel disease: Given the systemic signs of inflammation and gastrointestinal symptoms, an undiagnosed or atypical presentation of an inflammatory bowel disease could be considered."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Vishwajith Sridharan Medicine: An 82-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital with pain, swelling, and ecchymosis of the left arm. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 4 days before admission, when she awoke from sleep with swelling and discoloration of the skin of the left arm above the elbow. There was no history of trauma to the arm. Over the next 2 days, the swelling and discoloration spread to the elbow and forearm and pain developed. The patient presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 36.9C, the blood pressure 153/65 mm Hg, the pulse 59 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while she was breathing ambient air. Ecchymosis extended from above the left elbow to the left wrist, and there was pain with palpation of the left forearm. The radial pulse was normal, as was range of motion in the left elbow and wrist. Radiographs of the left forearm showed diffuse osteopenia and degenerative changes of the wrist joint, without fractures or bone lesions. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Ibuprofen was administered, and the patient was given a shoulder sling for comfort and discharged home. Over the next 2 days, the pain in the left arm worsened and the ecchymosis spread to the left hand and digits. The pain did not abate with the use of ice packs or acetaminophen or with elevation of the arm. The patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported pain in the left arm that occurred with supination or while she was making a fist. There was no numbness or tingling in the arm or hand or history of hemarthrosis, prolonged bleeding with dental procedures, or menorrhagia. The medical history was notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, carotid artery stenosis, osteoporo-sis, chronic kidney disease, and obesity, as well as an episode of deep venous thrombosis 40 years earlier. Medications included aspirin, ator-vastatin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and meto-prolol. The patient had smoked tobacco for 40 years but had quit 22 years earlier. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She was widowed and lived alone but visited with her grown children regularly. Her father had had coronary artery disease. On examination, the temperature was 36.1C, the blood pressure 169/77 mm Hg, the pulse 76 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 72.5 kg and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 32.3. There was discoloration of the left arm with sharp demarcation in the middle of the upper arm, proximal to the elbow, and uniform extension to the metacarpophalan-geal joints Fig. 1. There was tenderness with palpation of the forearm and dorsal wrist, passive range of motion of the wrist and elbow, and diffuse swelling and mild firmness of the forearm, without induration. Sensation to light touch was intact throughout the arm and hand. The radial pulse was normal, and the fingers were warm, with brisk capillary refill in all the digits. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of kidney- and liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Patrick D. Sutphin: Computed tomography CT of the left arm, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed disproportionate enlargement of the brachiora-dialis muscle, a finding suggestive of intramuscular hematoma. There was hyperdense strand-ing in the subcutaneous fat centered over the elbow and forearm, a finding consistent with hemorrhage Fig. 2. CT angiography of the arteries revealed heavy, partially calcified plaque throughout the thoracic aorta. Focal heavy plaque in the left subclavian artery proximal to the vertebral artery resulted in approximately 70 to 80 stenosis Fig. 3. The arteries in the left arm were otherwise patent. There were no signs of active hemorrhage on arterial or delayed-phase images or findings that could lead to localization of an arterial injury, such as pseudoaneurysm or dissection. In addition, an enhancing mass was not identified. The visualized superficial and deep veins were patent on delayed-phase images. Dr. Sridharan: A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Acquired factor VIII inhibitor. ", "prediction": "1. Intramuscular hematoma: Given the disproportionate enlargement of the brachioradialis muscle and findings on CT, the most likely diagnosis is an intramuscular hematoma, possibly related to underlying vascular pathology or medication.\n2. Spontaneous soft tissue hemorrhage: The ecchymosis and pain without trauma history, coupled with use of aspirin, suggest a high likelihood of soft tissue hemorrhage secondary to anticoagulant usage.\n3. Venous insufficiency: The patient's history of peripheral vascular disease and deep vein thrombosis increases the probability of venous insufficiency contributing to the symptoms.\n4. Ischemic muscle injury: Focal heavy plaque in the left subclavian artery leading to significant stenosis suggests a potential ischemic etiology contributing to muscle injury in the left arm.\n5. Thrombophlebitis: Given the patient's history of peripheral vascular disease and clinical findings, thrombophlebitis should be considered as a potential cause.\n6. Compartment syndrome: The presentation of increasing pain and swelling in the forearm, despite normal pulses, raises concern for compartment syndrome.\n7. Brachial plexus injury: A localized vascular pathology could lead to brachial plexus involvement resulting in pain and swelling.\n8. Infection/cellulitis: Though there's no fever or systemic signs, an underlying infection or cellulitis must be ruled out due to the skin changes and tenderness.\n9. Osteomyelitis: Given the patient's osteoporosis and bone integrity findings on radiographs, osteomyelitis, although less likely without systemic signs, remains a differential.\n10. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) recurrence: Despite the patent veins on imaging, a high index of suspicion remains warranted due to the patient's history of DVT."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Matthew J. Emmett Medicine: An 81-year-old man was admitted to this hospital with fever, cough, and shortness of breath during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 3 days before this admission, when fever and cough developed. On the morning of admission, he noted an abrupt onset of shortness of breath at rest and dyspnea on exertion. There was also substernal chest pain on the left side that worsened with deep breaths and when he lay down. The patients son called emergency medical services, and the patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient described ongoing chest pain and shortness of breath. The son reported that the patient had fallen at home 2 days before admission, but the patient did not remember falling and the son was not able to provide details about the nature or circumstances of the fall. The patient reported no pain in his abdomen, arms, legs, or groin and no headache. The patient had a history of hypertension. During a previous evaluation for cough, he was reportedly told that he had a lung disease that had caused the lung tissue to harden. Before the onset of his most recent symptoms, he had walked outside on a daily basis without limitation from shortness of breath. He took an unknown medication for hypertension. The patient did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. He lived in an apartment with his wife. On examination, the temperature was 37.9C, the blood pressure 157/95 mm Hg, the pulse 112 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The respiratory rate decreased to 28 breaths per minute and the oxygen saturation improved to 96 with the administration of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 22.8. Retractions were noted in the supraclavicular areas. Inspiratory crackles could be heard at the lung bases. The heart sounds were regular, with tachycardia but no murmur. There was no tenderness on palpation of the chest wall and no edema in the legs. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Reece J. Goiffon: A single-view portable an-teroposterior radiograph of the chest showed bilateral patchy airspace opacities that were more extensive in the left lung than in the right lung, with predominance in the peripheral lower lung zones and with relative sparing of the peri-hilar regions Fig. 1. These opacities were superimposed on mild apical and bibasilar bron-chiectasis and bibasilar reticular opacities. A radiograph of the pelvis showed no fracture. Dr. Emmett: An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Blood samples were obtained for culture, and a nasopharyngeal swab was submitted to test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Azithromycin and ceftriaxone were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On arrival at the medical floor, the patient was in respiratory distress, with a respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 86 while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The patient was restless and appeared uncomfortable, moving around in the bed and attempting to sit up; he reported severe pleuritic chest pain. The oxygen flow rate was adjusted to 5 liters per minute, and morphine was administered intravenously. A repeat electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Pneumonia associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and acute pulmonary embolism. ", "prediction": "1. COVID-19 pneumonia: Given the history of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and bilateral patchy airspace opacities on chest radiograph amid the pandemic, COVID-19 pneumonia is highly likely.\n2. Acute bacterial pneumonia: The rapid onset of symptoms and the patient's older age, coupled with bilateral patchy opacities and response to antibiotics, suggest bacterial pneumonia as a differential.\n3. Pulmonary embolism: The sudden onset of shortness of breath, tachycardia, and pleuritic chest pain, especially post-fall, raises the possibility of a pulmonary embolism.\n4. Exacerbation of chronic lung disease: The patient's history of lung disease with hardened lung tissue implies that exacerbation could present with severe respiratory distress and crackles on examination.\n5. Congestive heart failure: Tachycardia, retractions, and bilateral lung opacities, in the context of an elevated respiratory rate and peripheral edema, may indicate an exacerbation of congestive heart failure.\n6. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The rapid progression of respiratory distress and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates are consistent with ARDS, which could be secondary to infection or another precipitating event.\n7. Interstitial lung disease: The presence of bibasilar reticular opacities and a history of a lung disease causing tissue hardening could point towards an interstitial lung disease exacerbation.\n8. Pleural effusion: Severe pleuritic chest pain worsening with deep breaths and lying down, along with signs of respiratory distress, could suggest the presence of a pleural effusion.\n9. Myocardial infarction: Despite a lack of classical risk factors other than hypertension, the pleuritic chest pain and tachycardia necessitate consideration of a myocardial infarction.\n10. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the sudden onset of symptoms after a reported fall and unknown circumstances of the fall, aspiration leading to pneumonia is a potential diagnosis."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. David P. Bullis Behavioral Medicine, NewtonWellesley Hospital, Newton, MA: A 54-year-old man was evaluated by the neuropsychology service of this hospital because of irritability, confusion, and odd behaviors. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 months before the current evaluation, when he received a diagnosis of squamous-cell carcinoma of the tongue that had metastasized to the cervical lymph nodes. He underwent surgical dissection of the neck and resection of the tongue base on the right side, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy, which resulted in cancer remission. After treatment, neck pain and shoulder weakness developed and was attributed to postoperative neuropathy involving the right spinal accessory nerve. In the context of this illness and persistent pain, the patient sought care at the cancer center behavioral medicine clinic of this hospital and received a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety. During the next 8 months, the patient was seen for psychotherapy approximately every 2 weeks. Treatment for the pain included physical therapy, occupational therapy, massage therapy, acupuncture, trigger-point injections, and the use of a scapular elevation brace. Therapy with oxycodone, methadone, gabapentin, tizanidine, and duloxetine was started. Four months before the current evaluation, a sural nerve graft was placed in the right spinal accessory nerve from the proximal, functioning portion to the distal portion, but the pain and weakness did not abate. Six weeks before the current evaluation, the patient did not respond to telephone calls for 24 hours. The police were called and found the patient unresponsive with prescription medication bottles nearby. Emergency medical services personnel arrived, and the initial evaluation, in the patients home, was notable for a severely decreased respiratory rate. Naloxone was administered, the trachea was intubated, and the patient was taken to a local hospital. In the emergency department, the patient was pulseless with ongoing electrocardiographic activity. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, and epinephrine was administered; after 4 minutes, spontaneous circulation was restored. The dose of methadone was decreased, and therapy with oxycodone, gaba-pentin, and tizanidine was stopped. During the subsequent 6 days, septic shock, aspiration pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and delirium occurred. When these problems resolved, the patient was discharged home. Five weeks before the current evaluation, the patient participated in a video follow-up evaluation at the behavioral medicine clinic. He expressed embarrassment and frustration related to his apparent accidental overdose. He described persistent depression, increased anxiety, and no other new symptoms. Two weeks before the current evaluation, the patient missed a routine video follow-up evaluation at the behavioral medicine clinic, and his family was called. For the preceding 2 weeks, they had noticed that the patient was uncharacteristically agitated, irritable, talking loudly, and verbally abusive. Odd behaviors were reported. The patient had gotten lost while driving to a friends house that he visited frequently, had been pulled over by police for driving erratically with normal results on a breathalyzer test, and on another occasion, had been found walking along the highway under an overpass. He called family members repeatedly in the middle of the night, and he would not answer when the calls were returned. When the family requested a police wellness check of the patient, the patient retaliated by requesting a police wellness check of the family members. After this incident, the family was advised to take the patient to a local hospital for admission. At the local hospital, the patient reported no symptoms and noted that he had stopped taking methadone because he was concerned about a medication overdose. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 19, indicating cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function.1 Computed tomography CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nonspecific hypodensity in the centrum semiovale on the left side. The patient was told he had mild dementia. Visiting nurse services were arranged, and the patient was discharged home. One week before the current evaluation, the patients family reported that he had increased confusion and odd behaviors. He was unable to recall details of conversations that had happened minutes before. He could not operate the telephone or remote control and had emptied the trash can into the toilet. He had asked for his clothes to be cut off because he felt uncomfortable. Family members had been staying with the patient every night since his recent discharge because they were concerned about his safety. A neuropsychological evaluation was requested. Dr. Michael W. Parsons: The evaluation was conducted by the cancer center neuropsychology service of this hospital with the use of videoconferencing technology to reduce the risk of exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19. The patient acknowledged only minimal cognitive changes and was dismissive of the familys concerns. A review of systems was notable for fatigue, moderate depression, mild anxiety, and difficulty sleeping and keeping track of time. Additional history obtained from the patients family included insomnia, lumbar disk herniation, olecranon bursitis, and an inguinal hernia that had led to surgical repair in early adulthood. He had had multiple concussions as a teenager, as well as a brief loss of consciousness during a motor vehicle collision 3 years earlier. After the collision, fatigue, headaches, difficulty concentrating, and impaired memory occurred; during the subsequent 2 years, occupational therapy was provided, and the symptoms gradually resolved. Medications at the time of evaluation included ibuprofen, acetaminophen, duloxetine, trazo-done, melatonin, polyethylene glycol, and multivitamins. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England with family members nearby. He had completed a masters degree and had had a successful career; he had taken a leave of absence from work 9 months earlier in anticipation of cancer treatment. After cancer treatment, he had been unable to return to work because of pain. He was athletic, walked 3 miles daily, and enjoyed golfing. He rarely drank alcohol and had never smoked tobacco or used illicit drugs. His family history included breast cancer and dementia in his mother, hearing loss and hypertension in his father, metastatic cancer with an unknown primary source in his paternal grandfather, glaucoma and alcohol use disorder in his maternal grandmother, and a brain tumor in a more distant relative. On video neuropsychological examination, the patient was in no distress and was adequately groomed, with normal-appearing hygiene. His affect was irritable, and the fact that he reported no symptoms suggested limited insight. His spontaneous speech was fluent and well articulated. His thoughts were tangential, and he was frequently forgetful and easily distracted; his information processing speed was slow. A formal neuropsychological assessment revealed impaired executive functioning, marked by disin-hibition and poor working memory, as well as deficits in recent memory, verbal fluency, and information processing speed. Dr. Bullis: A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Delayed posthypoxic leukoencephalopathy. ", "prediction": "1. Medication-Induced Delirium: The patient's recent cognitive changes and erratic behaviors may be attributed to the side effects or withdrawal from his complex medication regimen, especially post-overdose.\n2. Post-Anoxic Encephalopathy: The patient's prolonged period of hypoxia following his overdose episode could result in brain injury, leading to cognitive and behavioral changes.\n3.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Claudio M. de Gusmao: A 69-year-old man was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital because of progressively worsening ataxia. The patient had been well until 9 years before this evaluation, when abnormal gait and impaired coordination developed. He was unable to walk in a straight line; he bumped into walls when walking down a hallway. He also had difficulty reading traffic signs while driving and noted a change in the quality of his voice. The patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of another hospital and began physical therapy. During the next several years, symptoms gradually worsened despite physical therapy. The patient was no longer able to drive or play golf, and he intermittently used a walker because of unsteadiness. He had frequent falls, including one that led to fractures in six ribs. His speech changes worsened, such that he could no longer sing. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital for evaluation. In the neurology clinic, the patient reported frequent bowel movements, approximately 10 per day. He had no vertigo, lightheadedness, hearing loss, tremor, erectile dysfunction, disturbance of sleep, or urinary incontinence. He reported a sense of visual disorientation with head movement and with changes in the direction of gaze. He had a history of hyperlipidemia. Medications included atorvastatin, cetirizine, and a multivitamin; there were no known drug allergies. The patient had recently moved from an urban area in the southeastern United States to a suburban area of New England. He drank one glass of wine nightly; additional alcohol use caused worsening of ataxia and dysarthria. He had previously smoked five cigarettes daily but had quit smoking 30 years before this evaluation; he did not use illicit drugs. The patients mother had died of heart failure at an elderly age, and his father had died after a stroke and myocardial infarction at 70 years of age. The patient had two adult children, who were healthy. His two brothers and one of his sisters had celiac disease; the sister also reportedly had a shuffling gait. The sisters daughter had received a diagnosis of Turners syndrome and had been seen by a neurologist for a balance disturbance. A brothers grandson also had celiac disease and a gait disturbance Fig. 1. The temperature was 36.6C, the blood pressure 136/88 mm Hg, and the pulse 72 beats per minute. The patient was alert, oriented, and attentive and provided a detailed history. He had moderate dysarthria, with impairment in the rate, rhythm, and clarity of speech. An oculomotor examination revealed complete and conjugate gaze in all directions; he had intact smooth pursuit movements but had slow, dysmetric saccades. Results of a head impulse test were abnormal, with corrective saccades noted bilaterally. Normal tone and full strength were present in all major muscle groups of the arms and legs. Reflexes were 2 and symmetric at the knees but absent at the ankles. Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. Rapid tapping of the index fingers on the thumbs was dysrhythmic and uncoordinated. Fingernosefinger testing revealed mild intention tremor. Heel-to-shin testing revealed symmetric jerking movements with lateral movements across the shins. Vibration and joint-position senses in the legs were profoundly decreased: the patient was unable to sense vibration at the toes, had a decreased ability to sense vibration at the knees, and had difficulty discerning the position of his big toe with his eyes closed. There was sway in his stance, regardless of whether his eyes were open, and he could not stand with the feet together. The patient walked without support. He had a wide-based gait with considerable staggering and jerky, stiff movements of the legs. He was unable to maintain balance in a tandem stance or to walk with a tandem gait. The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were test results for kidney, liver, and thyroid function; antibodies to thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin were not detected. Blood levels of cyanocobalamin, methyl-malonic acid, vitamin E, and glycated hemoglobin were normal; antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies and tissue transglutaminase antibodies were not detected. Results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. Genetic testing revealed no mutations in genes associated with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8. Clinical testing of otolith function revealed abnormal vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials on the left side. Nerve-conduction studies revealed absent or barely detectable responses in the bilateral sural nerves, left superficial peroneal nerve, left median nerve, left ulnar nerve, and right radial nerve. Results of motor nerve-conduction studies were normal, as were results of a modified barium-swallow evaluation. A previous workup at another hospital for chronic diarrhea had reportedly been normal, with no evidence of malabsorption. Dr. McKinley Glover: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head Fig. 2, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed mild diffuse parenchymal volume loss and prominent cerebellar volume loss, most notably involving the vermis and superior cerebellar hemispheres. There was mild flattening of the superior margin of the midbrain, and the ratio of midbrain to ventral pons was mildly reduced at 0.51 reference range, 0.52.1 The anteroposterior diameter of the midbrain was 8.90 mm reference range, 9.35.1 There was no abnormal signal in the pons, and the middle cerebellar peduncles were normal. There was a chronic lacunar infarct of the right thalamus. Dr. de Gusmao: Additional history was obtained, and a diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome due to a biallelic expansion in RFC1. ", "prediction": "1. Multiple System Atrophy (MSA): The combination of progressively worsening ataxia, dysarthria, and autonomic dysfunction (e.g., frequent bowel movements) is consistent with Multiple System Atrophy.\n2. Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA): Despite the absence of specific gene mutations, the presence of a family history of gait disturbances and ataxia suggests a hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia might still be a possibility with a less common gene mutation.\n3. Idiopathic Late-Onset Cerebellar Ataxia: Given the age of onset and progressive cerebellar symptoms, idiopathic late-onset cerebellar ataxia could be an explanation though the etiology remains unclear.\n4. Cerebellar Ataxia with Neuropathy and Vestibular Areflexia Syndrome (CANVAS): The presence of cerebellar atrophy, sensory neuropathy, and vestibular deficits aligns with the characteristic triad seen in CANVAS.\n5. Chronic Alcoholic Cerebellar Degeneration: Although the patient’s alcohol use is limited, the chronic alcohol exposure could contribute to the progressive cerebellar degeneration observed.\n6. Paraneoplastic Cerebellar Degeneration: The progressive ataxia and cerebellar volume loss may be secondary to an undiagnosed malignancy causing paraneoplastic neurological syndrome.\n7. Vitamin E Deficiency: Despite normal current levels, a history of prolonged subclinical deficiency could lead to cerebellar degeneration manifesting as ataxia.\n8. Mitochondrial Myopathy: Given the multisystem involvement, including neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms, a mitochondrial myopathy remains a consideration.\n9. Vascular Cerebellar Insufficiency: Chronic lacunar infarcts and potential cerebrovascular incidents might explain the cerebellar atrophy and ataxia, particularly with the noted midbrain changes.\n10.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Kathy M. Tran: A 33-year-old pregnant woman with ulcerative colitis was admitted to this hospital during the summer at 10 weeks of gestation because of fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and tenderness, and headache. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 days before this admission, when fever, rigors, nausea, and vomiting developed. During the next 3 days, the symptoms worsened; the patient was unable to eat, drink, or take medications. She reported abdominal pain and cramping on the left side that she described as being similar to previous flares of ulcerative colitis; she also had nonbloody diarrhea. The patient called the obstetrics clinic and was instructed to seek evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital. A review of systems was notable for fatigue, mild headache, neck pain, and photophobia. The patient reported no hematochezia, pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, dysuria, or joint pain. Ulcerative colitis had been diagnosed 11 years earlier; at the time of the diagnosis, she began treatment with azathioprine but stopped after 1 year because of severe fatigue. The patient had taken mesalamine and sulfasalazine intermittently for disease flares but typically stopped after a few months of treatment. Exacerbations of ulcerative colitis occurred approximately every year and were associated with fevers, rigors, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea. Nine months before this admission, Clostridioides difficile colitis developed, and the patient was successfully treated with oral vancomycin. Three weeks before the current admission, she was admitted to this hospital for a flare of ulcerative colitis; intravenous methylprednisolone, hydromorphone, and ondansetron were administered, and mesalamine was restarted. Flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed mild erythema and friable mucosa with a decreased vascular pattern in the sigmoid colon. Dr. Craig R. Audin: A transvaginal ultrasound image obtained during that admission showed a single viable intrauterine pregnancy at 7 weeks of gestation and trace subchorionic hemorrhage. Dr. Tran: The patient was discharged after 7 days once most of the symptoms had abated, although nausea persisted. The patient had had two previous successful pregnancies that had resulted in cesarean deliveries at full term. The patient reported that she had received all the usual child-hood immunizations. Routine prenatal serologic screening during the current pregnancy showed immunity to varicella but not to rubella. Tests for syphilis, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and human immunodeficiency virus HIV were negative. Other history included anemia, chronic back pain, migraines, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety. At the time of the current admission, medications included prednisone, mesalamine, omepra-zole, ondansetron, hydromorphone, tramadol, cyclobenzaprine, sumatriptan, gabapentin, loraze-pam, sertraline, pyridoxine, cholecalciferol, and prenatal vitamins. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in an urban area of New England with her male partner, with whom she was monogamous, as well as her two children. She worked as an administrator. She did not eat sushi or rare or raw meat, and she did not consume unpasteurized milk or cheese. She had no known sick contacts or exposure to animals. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit substances. Her mother had coronary artery disease, her father inflammatory bowel disease, and her sister depression. Her brother and two children were well. On examination, the temperature was 38.2C, the blood pressure 118/61 mm Hg, the pulse 116 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared tired and uncomfortable. The abdominal examination was remarkable for a healed surgical scar; there was diffuse tenderness that was most painful in the lower quadrants. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hemoglobin level was 7.7 g per deciliter reference range, 12.0 to 16.0, which was similar to the patients baseline level. Urinalysis was normal. Blood specimens were obtained for micro-biologic culture. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Audin: Color Doppler ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed mild fullness in the pelvi-calyceal system on the right side Fig. 1A that is probably a physiologic finding in pregnancy. There was trace fluid in the right lower quadrant; however, the appendix was not visualized Fig. 1B. Dr. Tran: Intravenous fluids, ondansetron, acetaminophen, and hydromorphone were adminis-tered; mesalamine was continued, and a tapering of the prednisone dose was begun. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and care. The next day, the abdominal pain persisted and was most severe in the right upper and right lower quadrants. The headache had increased in severity; it was pulsating in quality and was worst in the frontal region, with radiation to the occipital region and posterior neck. There was mild photophobia but no neck stiffness or limitation in the range of motion in the neck. Empirical treatment with intravenous ampicillin sulbactam and prophylaxis with oral vancomycin were started. On the third hospital day, the systolic blood pressure declined to 70 mm Hg; after intravenous fluids were administered, the systolic blood pressure increased to 100 mm Hg. Ultrasound images of the uterus obtained at the bedside confirmed a fetal heartbeat. A lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid CSF was clear and colorless, with a glucose level of 63 mg per deciliter 3.5 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter 2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter and a protein level of 17 mg per deciliter reference range, 5 to 55. There were 0 nucleated cells per microliter reference range, 0 to 5. Grams staining of the CSF revealed no neutro-phils and very few mononuclear cells; no organisms were identified. Dr. Audin: Three days later, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging MRI Fig. 1C through 1F, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a normal gravid uterus. On T2-weighted imaging, there were rounded areas of myometrial thickening with low signal intensity that were consistent with focal myometrial contractions, as well as a thin band of low signal intensity surrounding the fetus that was consistent with chorioamniotic separation; both of these findings were considered to be normal in the first trimester. The appendix was normal, without wall thickening, dilatation, or adjacent inflammatory changes. Although evaluation of the bowel was limited in the absence of oral and intravenous contrast material, the rectum also appeared normal, without obvious signs of active or chronic inflammation. A diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Listeria monocytogenes bacteremia resulting in loss of fetus. ", "prediction": "1. Ulcerative colitis flare: The patient’s history of ulcerative colitis, combined with abdominal pain, cramping, and nonbloody diarrhea, suggests a flare despite recent treatment.\n2. Clostridioides difficile infection: Given the history of prior C. difficile colitis and recent exacerbation of symptoms, a recurrent infection is possible even in the absence of bloody diarrhea.\n3. Pregnancy-related hyperemesis gravidarum: The symptoms of nausea and vomiting in the context of the first trimester of pregnancy might indicate severe pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting.\n4. Pyelonephritis: New-onset fever, rigors, and flank pain observed on ultrasonography hint at a possible urinary tract infection that could have ascended to the kidneys.\n5. Enteric infection: Gastroenteritis from viral or bacterial sources could manifest with fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in a patient with a weakened immune system.\n6. Pre-eclampsia with severe features: Although early in pregnancy, the headache, photophobia, and elevated blood pressure at one point suggest monitoring for pre-eclampsia.\n7. Sepsis: The hypotension and persistent fever along with an ongoing infection might be indicative of systemic infection requiring prompt intervention.\n8. Appendicitis: Despite normal ultrasound findings, clinical worsening of right-sided abdominal pain should not rule out appendicitis entirely.\n9. Small bowel obstruction: Abdominal pain and vomit in association with a complex medical history may point towards a mechanical or functional bowel obstruction.\n10. Inflammatory bowel disease-associated arthritis: The patient's history and abdominal symptoms, alongside new neck pain, may be related to an extra-intestinal manifestation of her ulcerative colitis, although joint pain is typically symmetric and migratory."}

Manzano Neurology: A 64-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital with cognitive impairment, headache, and memory loss. The patient had been well until 6 weeks before admission, when respiratory symptoms developed. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative. At around the same time, coworkers observed a decline in the patients performance at work. The patient noticed that she was having difficulty operating computers and was forgetting her personal passwords. The patient was evaluated at another hospital. Although she reported recent confusion and changes in cognitive performance, the examination at that time  including a neurologic examination with assessment of orientation, speech, and memory recall after 5 and 20 minutes  was unremarkable. The patient was referred for an outpatient neurologic evaluation. One week later 5 weeks before admission, severe headache developed suddenly, along with blurred vision, dizziness, and nausea. After the administration of ondansetron, the blurred vision, dizziness, and nausea resolved; after the administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, the headache became less severe, with mild pain and intermittent episodes of more severe pain. Three weeks before admission, the patient was seen in a neurology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. She had difficulty recalling the history of her symptoms. On examination, she was oriented to place and person only and was unable to perform serial sevens calculations or to spell world backward. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. The complete blood count with differential count and test results for liver and kidney function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, thiamine, and cobalamin. Tests for syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus infection were negative; other labora-tory test results are shown in Table 1. An electroencephalogram EEG showed no distinct epileptiform activity. Topiramate was prescribed for a working diagnosis of complex migraine. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head was performed. T2weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR images showed diffusely scattered hy-perintensities in the periventricular, subcortical, and deep white matter and leptomeningeal enhancement. In addition, there was evidence of frontal superficial siderosis and a few scattered microhemorrhages. Dr. Manzano: Lumbar puncture was also performed. On cerebrospinal fluid CSF analysis, the white-cell count was 46 per microliter reference range, 0 to 5, with a lymphocyte count of 99 reference range, 40 to 80, the red-cell count was 35 per microliter reference value, 0, and the protein level was 221 mg per deciliter reference range, 13 to 40; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of the CSF were negative. The administration of topiramate was stopped; treatment with oral doxycycline was started but then was stopped after 5 days, when results of a test for Borrelia burgdorferi were interpreted as negative. Over the next 3 weeks, intermittent headache persisted and cognitive impairment worsened. The patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital. She was unable to provide a history. According to the patients husband, the patient had stopped working and was no longer able to effectively care for herself, requiring assistance with daily activities such as bathing, dressing, and eating. She had difficulty planning and was unable to put on clothes in the correct sequence or to turn on the shower. Memory impairment persisted, conversation was tangential, and visual hallucinations frequently occurred. The patient had lost 6.8 kg in the past month. There was no fever, rash, or joint pain. The patient had a history of poliomyelitis in childhood, with residual mild weakness in the left leg; vitamin B12 deficiency, which had been corrected; and hypothyroidism. Medications included atorvastatin, levothyroxine, sertraline, vitamin B12, and cholecalciferol. She had a known allergy to amoxicillinclavulanate with an unknown reaction. She was a former smoker with a 40 pack-year history, and she had consumed four alcoholic beverages per week before the onset of the current illness. The patient worked in a health care clinic and lived with her husband in a suburban area of New England. She had not traveled outside the United States. She was an avid gardener; she had a dog but no other animal exposures. Her father had received a diagnosis of Alzheimers disease at 62 years of age. On examination, the patient was alert and interactive. The temperature was 36.7C, the blood pressure 105/51 mm Hg, the heart rate 56 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 32.4. The patient was oriented to time, place, and person. Her speech was fluent, with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. She had impaired abstraction and mildly impaired attention. She was unable to recall three objects after a delay. Intermittently during the examination, she had visual hallucinations that she knew were not real. Cranial nerve examination was unremarkable. Strength was 55 throughout, except in the left leg 45. Reflexes were brisk throughout, including 3 reflexes in the arms and the right lower leg; pectoralis reflexes and a jaw jerk were present. No ankle clonus was noted. Examinations for tone, sensation, and cerebellar function were unremarkable. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Gonzalez: MRI of the head was performed Fig. 1. FLAIR images showed slight progression of the diffuse subarachnoid hyperintensi-ties and leptomeningeal enhancement. Susceptibility-weighted images showed frontal superficial siderosis and scattered lobar microhemorrhages. Computed tomographic CT angiography of the head revealed patent cranial vessels, without evidence of aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or thrombosis. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen, obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. Dr. Manzano: Lumbar puncture was performed. On CSF analysis, the nucleated-cell count was 28 per microliter reference range, 0 to 5, the lymphocyte count 85, the red-cell count 53 per microliter, and the protein level 280 mg per deciliter. CSF was sent for culture and cytologic studies; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An EEG was normal. The patient was admitted to this hospital, and intravenous ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and meth-ylprednisolone were administered. During the first 48 hours, the patient was agitated and impulsive. Visual hallucinations worsened, and olanzapine was administered. The CSF culture was negative, and the CSF cytologic studies showed no malignant cells. A diagnostic test was performed.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Matthew B. Roberts: A 41-year-old woman who had undergone renal transplantation was admitted to this hospital because of bloody stools and thrombocytopenia. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 weeks before this admission, when mild rectal discomfort and nonbloody diarrhea developed. The episodes of diarrhea occurred several times a day and were not associated with fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. Two weeks before this admission, the patient sought evaluation at this hospital. The abdominal and rectal examinations were normal. The hemoglobin level was 11.0 g per deciliter reference range, 14.0 to 18.0 and the platelet count 129,000 per microliter reference range, 150,000 to 450,000. Stool cultures and tests of the stool for Clostridioides difficile antigen and toxin and Shiga toxin were negative, as was examination of the stool for ova and parasites. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with docusate was stopped, treatment with topical rectal hydrocortisone cream was started, and a recommendation was made to increase the amount of fiber in the diet. During the next week, the episodes of diarrhea decreased in frequency to once a day; however, the rectal pain persisted. One week before this admission, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician because the rectal pain had worsened; she was unable to sit down, and new tenesmus was present. A rectal examination revealed mild tenderness and thin yellow-brown liquid stool, with no evidence of blood or an external anal injury. A radiograph of the abdomen was normal. Docusate, senna, and topical lidocaine jelly were prescribed. Three days before this admission, bowel movements with tarry black and loose maroon stools and dark clots began to occur multiple times a day. When the episodes increased in frequency to every hour and there was bright-red blood per rectum, the patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported severe rectal pain and burn-ing, as well as fatigue, dizziness, and weakness. She did not report fever, chills, abdominal pain, hematemesis, hemoptysis, epistaxis, rash, bruising, hematuria, or menorrhagia. The patient was congenitally deaf. She had received a diagnosis of kidney disease 12 years earlier, when proteinuria and hypertension developed during pregnancy and did not resolve postpartum. Pathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen had reportedly revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The patient was presumed to have Alports syndrome; no genetic testing had been performed. Ten years before the current evaluation, the patient had discontinued all prescribed medications, including prednisone and labetalol, without talking to her doctors; 3 years later, she presented to this hospital with dyspnea on exertion and end-stage renal failure. Hemodialysis was started and continued until a deceased-donor renal transplantation was performed 6 months before the current evaluation. Routine pretransplantation serologic testing of the patient revealed IgG antibodies to Epstein Barr virus EBV and no antibodies to cytomega-lovirus CMV. Serologic testing of the donor also revealed IgG antibodies to EBV and no antibodies to CMV. Induction immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin, belatacept, predni-sone, and everolimus was initiated; famciclovir was administered for 3 months after transplantation. Treatment with prednisone was stopped 2 months after transplantation, when diabetes developed. At the time of the current evaluation, medications included aspirin, linagliptin, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, and omeprazole, as well as cholecalciferol, docusate, senna, topical hydro-cortisone cream, and topical lidocaine jelly. The dose of everolimus had been decreased 1 month before this evaluation; belatacept had last been infused 2 weeks earlier. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her male partner and young son in an urban area of New England. She had not traveled recently. She had previously worked part-time as a teacher. There had been no exposure to animals other than two pet dogs. She had never smoked tobacco and did not drink alcohol. Her sister was deaf and had a history of renal failure that had led to renal transplanta-tion. Her father had a history of diabetes and renal failure that required hemodialysis. On examination, the temperature was 37.2C, the blood pressure 85/46 mm Hg, the pulse 130 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared pale and unwell. There was no jaundice or lymphadenopathy. There were palatal petechiae and sublingual ecchymoses, but there was no bleeding from the gums or nose. There was a healed surgical incision in the right lower abdomen and no tenderness over the renal allo-graft. A rectal examination revealed tenderness and dark blood with clots. The hemoglobin level was 6.0 g per deciliter and the platelet count 0 per microliter. A peripheral-blood smear showed red cells that were generally normal in size and morphology, with few hypochromic cells and rare pencil cells; there were no schistocytes or platelets. A direct antiglobulin test was negative. Blood cultures were obtained. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Onofrio A. Catalano: Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no bowel-wall thickening or distention. The spleen and liver were normal in size. The renal allograft was visible in the right lower quadrant Fig. 1. The transplanted kidney was enlarged and surrounded by extensive peri-nephric fat stranding. A small amount of free fluid was also present. There was moderate hydroureteronephrosis that extended up to the ureterovesical anastomosis. The renal collecting system, pelvis, and ureter contained spontaneously hyperdense material that was suggestive of blood breakdown products. No obstructing calculi were seen. Dr. Roberts: Intravenous fluids were administered, and the blood pressure increased to 97/53 mm Hg. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and treatment with everolimus and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole was stopped. During the next 24 hours, 4 units of packed red cells and 5 units of pooled platelets were transfused. On the second hospital day, the hemoglobin level was 11.0 g per deciliter and the platelet count 4 per microliter. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Cytomegalovirus-induced immune thrombocy-topenia. ", "prediction": "1. Gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to anticoagulant use: Given the patient’s recent renal transplant, she is likely on anticoagulant therapy which could increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.\n2. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): Post-transplantation patients are at risk for GVHD, which can present with gastrointestinal bleeding and thrombocytopenia.\n3. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): The acute presentation of severe thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia can be indicative of TTP.\n4. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis: The patient’s immunosuppressive state post-transplant increases her risk for CMV infection, which can cause colitis and gastrointestinal bleeding.\n5. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD): Given the presence of EBV antibodies, PTLD is a plausible diagnosis, particularly with gastrointestinal involvement and thrombocytopenia.\n6. Sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The combination of thrombocytopenia, anemia, and hypotension raises the suspicion for DIC secondary to septicemia.\n7. Acute gastrointestinal malignancy: Sudden onset of gastrointestinal bleeding in the post-transplant period could suggest an underlying malignancy, such as colorectal cancer.\n8. Peptic ulcer disease: The patient’s use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and stress from recent medical conditions could lead to peptic ulcers causing gastrointestinal bleeding.\n9. Infection with Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile): Although initial tests were negative, false negatives can occur, and C. difficile colitis can lead to significant bleeding and diarrhea.\n10. Hemorrhoidal bleeding: The patient’s rectal pain and tenesmus, combined with bright-red blood per rectum, could indicate bleeding hemorrhoids, a common and benign cause of rectal bleeding."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Jonathan R. Wing: A 48-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of fatigue and swelling in both legs. The patient had been well until 8 months before the current admission, when fatigue and lethargy developed. He thought the fatigue was associated with alcohol consumption and reduced his intake to 12 beers weekly; before this, he had consumed 24 beers weekly for 15 years. Three months before the current admission, the patients weight had decreased by 9.1 kg. However, 3 weeks before this admission, the weight had increased by 9.6 kg and swelling developed in both legs. He thought the weight gain was related to diet changes, including consumption of pizza, pasta, and soup, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. One week before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. He was instructed to elevate his legs, wear compression stockings, and decrease dietary sodium to 2 g daily. On the day of the current admission, the leg swelling had not abated and new abdominal distention occurred. He called the primary care clinic and was instructed to seek evaluation at the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation, a review of systems was notable for fatigue, lethargy, decreased appetite, abdominal bloating, constipation, penile swelling, decreased libido, intolerance of cold temperatures, and ankle and knee pain in both legs that was worse when the patient was climbing stairs. There was no fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, or hematochezia. Sixteen months before the current evaluation, the patient had been admitted to this hospital with pneumonia involving the right upper and middle lobes that was due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae. During that admission, he received diagnoses of diabetes and normocytic anemia. After discharge from the hospital, laboratory evaluation revealed a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.1 reference range, 4.3 to 6.4. Metformin was prescribed, and follow-up evaluation was recommended; however, the patient had not returned to the primary care clinic before the current illness. CME The patient had not started taking metformin until 3 weeks before the current evaluation; he took no other medications and had no known drug allergies. He lived with his wife and two children in an urban area of New England. He did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother had Parkinsons disease and dementia; he did not know the health of his father or paternal half-siblings. On examination, the temperature was 36.6C, the blood pressure 98/54 mm Hg, the heart rate 64 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 27.3. The patient did not have jaundice, scleral icterus, or spider angiomas. He had jugular venous distention and an S3 gallop; there were no rales. The abdomen was distended, with dullness on percussion of the flanks; there was no hepatosplenomegaly. There was 2 symmetric pitting edema in the lower legs up to the knees. Mild palmar erythema was present; there was no asterixis. The blood glucose level was 402 mg per deciliter 22.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter 3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter; the glycated hemoglobin level was 11.6. The platelet count was 82,000 per microliter reference range, 150,000 to 400,000. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Reece J. Goiffon: Radiography of the chest revealed new elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and atelectasis in the lower lobes. Ultrasonogra-phy with Doppler analysis of the abdomen revealed mild thickening of the gallbladder wall, coarsened liver echotexture, moderate ascites, and mild splenomegaly; the portal veins were patent. Duplex ultrasonography revealed nonocclusive deep-vein thrombosis of the right popliteal vein. Dr. Wing: Paracentesis was performed with ultrasonographic guidance, and 50 ml of peritoneal fluid was drained. Results of peritoneal fluid analysis are shown in Table 1; cytologic examination of the fluid revealed no malignant cells. Electrocardiography revealed normal sinus rhythm with occasional premature atrial complexes, left axis deviation, and T-wave inversions in leads I and aVL. Insulin and enoxaparin were administered subcutaneously, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. A diagnostic test was performed.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Reuben A. Hendler Psychiatry: A 37-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of fever, shortness of breath, and suicidal ideation in March 2020, during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19. Ten days before this admission, fever, fatigue, sore throat, cough, and myalgias developed. The symptoms did not abate after the patient took aspirin and acetaminophen. Five days before this admission, she sought evaluation at the urgent care clinic of this hospital because Covid-19 had been diagnosed in two coworkers. A test for Covid-19 was not performed because of limited test availability; tests for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus were not performed because of a statewide shortage of nasopharyngeal swabs. The patient was instructed to quarantine at home. During the next 5 days, the patient quarantined in a room in her apartment. Her husband periodically brought food to the door of the room. The fever, fatigue, sore throat, cough, and myalgias persisted; new shortness of breath and anosmia developed. She had decreased appetite, and she consumed minimal food and drink. One day before this admission, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea developed, and the patient sought evaluation at the emergency department of another hospital. Intravenous fluid, ondansetron, and ketorolac were administered, and she was discharged home with instructions to continue to quarantine. On the day of admission, the patient had dizziness while standing, as well as shortness of breath, and she returned to the urgent care clinic of this hospital. The temperature was 38.7C, the heart rate 127 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 38 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was anxious and tearful. The lungs were clear on auscultation. Intravenous fluid, ondansetron, and oral acetaminophen were administered. The dizziness resolved, and the fever, shortness of breath, and anxiety decreased. The patient was advised to return home to quarantine; however, she disclosed that if she were sent home, she planned to overdose on medications to die by suicide because of her anxiety and feelings of sadness and loneliness. Owing to concern about the patients risk of harming herself, an order authorizing temporary involuntary hospitalization was implemented. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was brought to the emergency department. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported anxiety, palpitations, and shortness of breath and noted that her anxiety and feelings of isolation and loneliness had developed during quarantine. She also reported poor sleep, decreased energy, and anhedonia. The patient described that she felt like a burden to her husband and was terrified that she would transmit severe acute respiratory syndrome coro-navirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 to her children, including her 4-year-old son, who had been born prematurely and had a congenital pulmonary condition. In addition, the patient reported a 1-week history of new, recurring nightmares in which she would see herself playing with her own severed body parts; these nightmares occurred more frequently during periods of high fever. She intermittently had the sensation that someone was in the room with her while she was awake, even though she was aware that she was alone. She disclosed that, on the previous day, she had had new suicidal ideation associated with fear of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to her family and that she had taken five aspirinparacetamolcaffeine pills at once. There had been no history of suicidal ideation or attempt, self-harm, or homicidal ideation. The patient had a history of depression and panic attacks when she was a teenager and had been treated for less than 1 year with a medication that she could not recall; the symptoms had resolved by 19 years of age, and there had been no mental health follow-up. She also had a history of migraines, which occurred four times per week. She took aspirin, acetaminophen, and aspirinparacetamolcaffeine as needed; there were no known drug allergies. The patient was born in Central America and had been living in the United States for 19 years. She lived with her husband, four children, and mother-in-law in an urban area of New England in a community that was predominantly Latinx and that had a high rate of Covid-19related infections and deaths. The patient did not complete high school while she was living in Central America and was currently employed full time in a food-production factory. She reported that she enjoyed her job but that she had been reluctant to work during the Covid-19 pandemic because of concern about becoming ill; however, she described that she felt obligated to work to support her family. The patient did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had died from cancer. On examination, the temperature was 38.2C, the blood pressure 148/84 mm Hg, the heart rate 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared well-groomed and fatigued, and she was tearful with a depressed and dysphoric mood. Her behavior was described as sullen, and there was limited eye contact and reduced psychomotor activity. Her speech, in Spanish, was fluent but was slow and mumbling, with reduced prosody. She had no derailment of thought, delusions, or obsessions, but she ruminated on her nightmares. She stated that she had no current suicidal ideation but that she might attempt suicide if she had to return to her children and expose them to SARS-CoV-2 again. Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was positive. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Radiography of the chest revealed ground-glass opacities in the right middle and lower lobes and in the left lower lobe. Intravenous ceftriaxone, oral azithromycin, atorvastatin, and hydroxychlo-roquine were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Management decisions were made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Fear associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), causing suicidal ideation. ", "prediction": "1.

Materne Pediatrics: A 12-month-old boy with Hirschsprungs disease was admitted to this hospital because of fever. Fifteen days before the current admission, the patient had a temperature of 39.7C. His parents noticed that he was fussy and less active than usual and that he had a decreased appetite along with several episodes of spitting up; there was no vomiting or diarrhea. During the next 5 days, fever occurred daily and abated with the administration of acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Ten days before the current admission, a bowel movement with watery, nonbloody, foul-smelling, mustard-yellow stool occurred. The patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. On examination, the patient was irritable. The abdomen was soft and non-tender. There were well-circumscribed, erythematous, edematous plaques on the abdomen, legs, feet, and forearms. The alanine aminotransferase level was 131 U per liter reference range, 10 to 55, the aspartate aminotransferase level 250 U per liter reference range, 9 to 80, the ferritin level 3826 g per liter reference range, 30 to 300, and the d-dimer level 3218 ng per milliliter reference range, 500. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 40 mm per hour reference range, 0 to 15; the white-cell count was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A radiograph of the abdomen showed gas-filled loops of bowel. The rectum was irrigated, and intravenous piperacillintazobactam was administered. On the third hospital day, the patient was afebrile and able to take formula, and the diarrhea abated. He was discharged home with a prescription for a course of metro-nidazole. During the next 2 days, the patient had no fever or diarrhea. However, 4 days before the current admission, a day-care worker observed that the patient appeared tired. During the subsequent 3 days at home, fever again developed, with chills and a decreased appetite. The day before the current admission, the patient cried through the night. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The parents reported that the patient was fussy and had poor sleep and generalized weakness; there was no diarrhea or new rash. The parents did not think that the patient was in pain. Additional history was obtained from the parents. The patient had met developmental milestones until 1 month earlier, when he had stopped crawling. He had previously been able to pull his body into a standing position, but he no longer attempted this maneuver. If he was placed in a standing position, he collapsed; if he was placed in a sitting position, he was able to stay upright. He had previously passed objects from hand to hand, but he had a new preference of holding objects with the left hand. Two days before this evaluation, the parents had noticed that the patient no longer walked with support; he seemed to dislike having his hands held. The patient had cornea plana and a history of Hirschsprungs disease, for which he had undergone laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy and an anal pull-through procedure at 2 months of age. Four months before the current evaluation, an intermittent diffuse rash on the trunk, arms, and legs had developed. The rash was characterized by purplish and pinkish plaques that appeared and varied in intensity of color throughout the day; it did not seem to be itchy or painful and usually resolved within 24 hours without treatment. Immunizations were up to date. Medications included metronidazole, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and cetirizine, as well as carboxymethylcel-lulose eye drops; there were no known allergies to medications. The patient lived with his mother, father, and pet dog in a small town in New England, and he attended day care 5 days per week. His mother was healthy, and his father had irritable bowel syndrome and Poland syndrome congenital aplasia of unilateral chest-wall muscles. His paternal grandmother had hypothyroidism, his maternal great-grandfather had had pancreatic cancer, his paternal great-grandfather had had breast cancer, a maternal second cousin had autism, and multiple maternal family members had Raynauds phenomenon. On examination, the temperature was 38.3C, the blood pressure 113/52 mm Hg, the heart rate 166 beats per minute normal range for age, 80 to 160, and the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute normal range for age, 30 to 60. The patient was diaphoretic and irritable, and he cried during the examination. He had rhinorrhea. The abdomen was not distended or tender. There was limited extension of the wrists and knees, as well as limited inversion and eversion of the feet. The ankles were mildly stiff, and the feet were mildly swollen. There were erythematous plaques on the abdomen, back, arms, and legs Fig. 1. The ferritin and d-dimer levels remained elevated, and the aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 75 mm per hour, the white-cell count 26,820 per microliter reference range, 6000 to 17,500, and the platelet count 682,000 per microliter reference range, 150,000 to 400,000. Blood cultures and urinalysis were normal. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coro-navirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Randheer Shailam: A radiograph of the chest and abdomen was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed cholelithiasis and prominent lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed a small amount of joint fluid in the hips and knees Fig. 2; the amount of fluid appeared to be within the normal range. Computed tomography CT of the abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder, without gallbladder distention. There were a few prominent lymph nodes in the paraaortic, iliac, and inguinal regions Fig. 2. Transtho-racic echocardiography showed normal coronary arteries. Dr. Materne: The empirical administration of intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and metroni-dazole was begun. During the next 3 days, the fever continued and the white-cell count remained elevated. On the seventh hospital day, the fever, leukocytosis, and elevation in levels of inflammatory markers persisted. The administration of antibiotic agents was stopped. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. ", "prediction": "1. Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C): Elevated inflammatory markers, high fever, and multisystem involvement including gastrointestinal symptoms, skin rash, and abnormalities in liver function tests suggest MIS-C.\n2.

Bacterial Sepsis: Despite negative blood cultures, the patient’s persistent fever, high white-cell count, and elevated inflammatory markers could still be indicative of bacterial sepsis, especially given the patient's immunosuppressive condition post-Hirschsprung's surgery.\n4. Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA): The recurring fever, rash, and elevated ferritin level are typical features of sJIA, which could also explain the joint involvement.\n5. Viral Infection: Although SARS-CoV-2 was excluded, other viral infections can present with fever, irritability, and elevated liver enzymes.\n6. Acute Cholecystitis: Identified cholelithiasis and gallbladder involvement could point toward acute cholecystitis, explaining recurrent fever and elevated inflammatory markers.\n7. Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH): Markedly elevated ferritin and persistent fever raise the suspicion of HLH, a severe hyperinflammatory syndrome.\n8. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): Given family history and the patient's previous GI symptoms, an exacerbation of IBD could be considered, explaining recurrent fever and elevated inflammatory markers.\n9. Drug Reaction: The various medications the patient is on, particularly metronidazole or ibuprofen, might cause drug fever and rash, presenting with elevated inflammatory markers.\n10. Malignancy (e.g., Leukemia): An underlying malignancy such as leukemia might present with fever, high white-cell count, elevated inflammatory markers, and multisystem involvement."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. David M. Dudzinski: A 47-year-old right-handed man was evaluated at this hospital because of pain on the left side of the head and neck. Six years before the current evaluation, the patient was admitted to this hospital with 1 week of headache, pain on the left side of the neck, numbness on the left side of the face, and dizziness. The pain was not relieved with the use of ibuprofen and had previously been evaluated and treated by a chiropractor. A neu-rologic examination revealed a slight decrease in taste and in sensation to touch and temperature on the left side of the face; a gait evaluation revealed a subtle leftward sway. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Byung C. Yoon: Computed tomography CT of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed subtle foci of hypoden-sity in the left cerebellum, a finding suggestive of infarction. There was no evidence of arterial dissection, aneurysm, stenosis, or thrombotic occlusion. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, confirmed the presence of a left medial cerebellar infarct and a small left lateral medullary infarct Fig. 1A, 1B, and 1C. Dr. Dudzinski: The patient had normal results on cerebrospinal fluid CSF analysis, echocardiography, and a hypercoagulability panel, except for a mildly elevated level of anticardiolipin IgM 18.9 IgM phospholipid units; reference range, 0 to 15. During the hospital admission, lesions with a vesicular appearance developed on the left side of the lips and oral cavity, and the patient was treated with famciclo-vir. He was discharged home while receiving aspirin, with a follow-up visit scheduled in the neurology clinic. One month later in the neurology clinic, the patient reported partial resolution of headache, persistent neck pain and ear pain with balance difficulty, and perioral paresthesia. There was diminished sensation on the left side of the face similar to that observed during the previous examination. No oropharyngeal lesions were visible. An evaluation of gait and balance was normal. Dr. Yoon: Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed expected evolution of the left cerebellar infarct and no new infarction. The left posterior inferior cerebellar artery was not visualized, possibly because of occlusion or slow blood flow. Dr. Dudzinski: Repeat CSF analysis showed normal protein and glucose levels and 14 white cells per microliter reference range, 0 to 5, of which 94 were lymphocytes. Grams staining showed no organisms. CSF tests for borrelia and varicella DNA and for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus antibodies were negative. Two days later, cerebral angiography revealed mild narrowing of the origin of the left vertebral artery. Tests for antinuclear antibodies, antineutro-phil cytoplasmic antibodies, and anti-La and anti-Ro antibodies were negative, as was a rapid plasma reagin test. The patient received follow-up care at another hospital until the current evaluation, when he presented to the emergency department of this hospital with 3 days of severe pain on exertion that affected the left side of the neck and left temporo-occipital region. The symptoms were similar to those he had reported in the past and were not relieved with the use of ibuprofen or marijuana. The head pain was described as pulsating and pounding, and it worsened when he was in the supine position. The patient reported right flank pain; the onset of this pain had occurred with lifting of a heavy object and had just preceded the onset of headache. He also reported a tendency to bruise. The review of systems was otherwise normal. His medical history was notable for dyslipidemia. He had undergone repair of meniscus tears in both knees and repair of a traumatic dislocation of the right shoulder. Medications included rosu-vastatin and gemfibrozil, as well as acetaminophen as needed. There were no known adverse reactions to medications. The patient was a self-employed laborer and lived with his wife and children in a suburb of Boston. He smoked cigars and marijuana occasionally, and he drank up to eight beers per day on weekends. His family history was notable for hypertension and dyslipid-emia in both of his parents, as well as early-onset dementia in his father. The temperature was 36.7C, the blood pressure 1761/19 mm Hg in both arms, the heart rate 72 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air. A neurologic examination revealed a mild decrease in coordination in the left hand but was otherwise normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, troponin T, C-reactive protein, lipoproteina, and glycated hemoglobin were normal, as were the prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and results of renal function tests. Urinalysis was also normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Yoon: CT angiography of the head and neck, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed dissection of the left vertebral artery, extending from the origin of the artery to the proximal V3 upper cervical segment, with a 2-mm pseudoaneurysm at the C2C3 level Fig. 1D and 1E. There was no evidence of acute ischemia. MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, did not reveal any evidence of infarction or a perfusion abnormality. However, a T1-weighted image showed a focus of intrinsic hyperintensity along the left vertebral artery, a finding consistent with hemorrhage within the vessel wall from the dissection Fig. 1F. Dr. Dudzinski: The patient was admitted to the neurology service. Control of the blood pressure required multiple medications. Echocardiography showed no cardiac, valvular, or aortic structural abnormality. Right flank pain recurred. Urinalysis showed 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field but was otherwise normal. Dr. Yoon: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed dissection of the right renal artery, extending from the origin of the artery to subsegmental renal arteries. Perinephric fat stranding was present on the right side, and there were areas of diminished enhancement in the right kidney. These findings were suggestive of infarction Fig. 2. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. ", "prediction": "1. Vertebral Artery Dissection: The CT angiography revealing dissection of the left vertebral artery, along with the pseudoaneurysm and intrinsic hyperintensity on T1-weighted MRI, indicates hemorrhage within the vessel wall.\n\n2. Cerebellar Infarct: History and MRI findings of the left cerebellar and lateral medullary infarcts, combined with symptoms like coordination issues and gait imbalance, suggest recurrent cerebellar infarction.\n\n3. Right Renal Artery Dissection: The CT findings of dissection extending from the origin to subsegmental arteries with accompanying infarction and fat stranding in the right kidney are indicative of renal artery dissection.\n\n4. Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS): The mildly elevated anticardiolipin IgM levels and history of multiple infarcts suggest a possible underlying APS, which could explain the patient's thrombotic events.\n\n5. Herpes Zoster (Shingles): The development of vesicular lesions on the left side of the lips and oral cavity during a prior hospital stay and treatment with famciclovir suggest a possible reactivation of varicella-zoster virus.\n\n6. Hypertensive Encephalopathy: The patient's severe headache that worsens in the supine position, high blood pressure, and need for multiple medications for blood pressure control may indicate hypertensive encephalopathy.\n\n7. Dyslipidemia-induced Vascular Disease: Given the patient's history of dyslipidemia, treated with rosuvastatin and gemfibrozil, along with familial history, it remains a strong risk factor for vascular complications.\n\n8. Migraine: The description of the pounding, pulsating nature of the head pain, and its exacerbation when lying down are consistent with migraine, particularly given the chronicity of headaches.\n\n9. Traumatic Injury: The temporal relationship of the patient's right flank pain with heavy lifting and subsequent onset of headache, coupled with his history as a self-employed laborer, raises the possibility of trauma-related exacerbation of symptoms.\n\n10. Alcohol-related Headache: The patient's substantial alcohol intake, up to eight beers per day on weekends, could contribute to his headache symptoms, particularly considering the typical pattern of alcohol-induced headache."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Philippe-Antoine Bilodeau Medicine: A 21-year-old man presented to this hospital with a sore throat, epistaxis, and petechiae of the oropharynx. One week before the current presentation, blood-filled blisters developed inside the patients mouth, on the buccal mucosa. He had occasional bleeding from the mouth that resolved spontaneously. He consulted with his dentist, who was concerned about the possibility of impacted wisdom teeth. Two days before the current presentation, a sore throat developed. There was no difficulty with swallowing. On the day of the current presentation, epistaxis developed and did not resolve over a period of 2 hours. The patient presented to another hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 37.1C, the blood pressure 142/76 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while he was breathing ambient air. He had blood in the nares and petechiae on the soft palate. There was a large ecchymosis on the left forearm that the patient attributed to carrying heavy boxes several days earlier. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory testing revealed a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g per deciliter reference range, 13.5 to 17.5, a platelet count of 1000 per microliter reference range, 150,000 to 450,000, and a white-cell count of 670 per microliter reference range, 4000 to 11,000. The absolute neutrophil count was 50 per micro-liter reference range, 1800 to 7000. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of tests for coagulation, renal function, and liver function. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The nose was packed to control the bleeding, and 1 unit of platelets was transfused. The patient was transferred to this hospital for additional evaluation and treatment. In the emergency department of this hospital, the patient reported a mild sore throat but no other symptoms; epistaxis had resolved with nasal packing. There was no fever, weight loss, rash, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The patient had a history of sickle cell trait. He took no medications and had no known allergies. He had been living with his parents and younger brother since he had left his col-lege campus at the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19 pandemic. He worked in a grocery store, and his only known sick contact was his mother, who had been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 2 months earlier. She had been isolated in a room in their home during her illness. The patient did not have any symptoms associated with Covid-19 and had never been tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. His father and brother had been well. The family lived adjacent to a wooded region, and the patient had been hiking in northern New England 2 months before the current presentation. He had not noticed any tick bites. He had no animal contacts. The patient was born in Central America and had moved to a suburban region of New England at 3 years of age. He had previously traveled to Mexico and Canada. He was sexually active with female partners only. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His father had hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and paternal family members had sickle cell disease. On examination, the patient appeared well. There were petechiae on the soft palate Fig. 1. There was no scleral icterus, lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly. A large ecchymosis was present on the left forearm. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of folate and cobalamin were normal, as were results of serum protein electrophoresis and the ratio of free kappa to lambda light chains. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A radio-graph of the chest and an ultrasound image of the upper abdomen were normal, without sple-nomegaly. Testing of a specimen obtained from the nasopharynx was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA; the patient was admitted to the hospital and placed in enhanced isolation. Examination of thick and thin peripheral-blood smears for babesia was negative. A second unit of platelets was transfused, and a diagnostic test was performed.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: CME Dr. Austin Be Surgery: A 14-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of swelling of the left jaw. The patient had been well until 6 weeks before this admission, when she noticed a lump in the left lower jaw; there was no pain, tenderness, or discomfort in the jaw. She was evaluated in a primary care clinic of another hospital and was told that a salivary gland may be obstructed. Treatment with sialagogues, increased oral hydration, warm compresses, and massage of the salivary glands were recommended. During the next 3 weeks, the lump in the left jaw increased in size, and swelling of the left side of the face and neck developed. Three weeks before this admission, she returned to the primary care clinic; treatment with cephalexin was started. Eighteen days before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the otolaryngol-ogy clinic of the other hospital. The temperature was 37.2C, the blood pressure 132/90 mm Hg, the heart rate 86 beats per minute, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 21.0. There was swelling in the left mandibular and submandibular areas, with no erythema, fluc-tuance, or palpable salivary stones. Dr. Hillary R. Kelly: Computed tomography CT of the face and neck was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. CT of the face Fig. 1 revealed a 3.7-cm mass in the left mandibular body, with lytic and expansile features and numerous internal wavy septations. Areas of marked thinning and obliteration were noted in the buccal and lingual cortexes of the mandible, and extension of the mass among the roots of the first molar, second molar, and premolar was observed. No fluidfluid or bloodfluid levels were seen within the lesion. There was no lymphadenopathy. The patient was referred to the otolaryngol-ogy clinic at this hospital. Dr. Be: Fifteen days before this admission, the patient reported numbness and tingling in the lower lip and chin on the left side. She had had no fatigue, fever, chills, or redness and no pain in her face, jaw, or neck. On examination, she appeared well but had obvious facial asymmetry with swelling of the left mandible Fig. 2. There was a firm, mildly tender mass in the body of the left man-dible that extended to the mandibular angle. Orthodontic braces were in place and dentition and jaw occlusion were normal. The remainder of the ear, nose, and throat examination was normal. The overlying skin was normal, and no anterior or posterior submandibular or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy was present. The blood levels of sodium, potassium, and chloride were normal, as were the complete blood count and the results of tests of coagulation and renal function. The calcium level was 11.8 mg per deciliter 3.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter 2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter, and the albumin level was 4.1 g per deciliter reference range, 3.3 to 5.0. Radiography of the chest was normal. Dr. Vania Nose: An intraoral biopsy of the left mandibular mass was performed. Pathological examination Fig. 3C of the biopsy specimen revealed that the lesion was partially surrounded by reactive bone trabeculae, was hemorrhagic, and contained numerous osteoclast-type giant cells around extravasated red cells, findings that were consistent with a central giant-cell lesion or a central giant-cell granuloma. Dr. Be: Ten days before this admission, the patient was seen in the oral and maxillofacial surgical clinic of this hospital, and admission for the excision of the left mandibular mass was planned. On admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The patient had normal growth and development and had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. She had finished the prescribed course of cephalexin and had taken no other medications; penicillin had caused fever and hives early in childhood. She lived in a suburban area of New England with her mother, stepfather, and two cats; she frequently stayed in another suburban area of New England with her father. The patient performed well in high school and participated in theater. She did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. Her mother had hypothyroidism; her father had obstructive sleep apnea. Her maternal grandmother had a history of hypothyroidism, parathyroid ad-enoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer; her paternal grandfather had died from colon cancer. The temperature was 36.6C, the blood pressure 128/85 mm Hg, and the heart rate 111 beats per minute. The physical examination was unchanged. The left mandibular mass was excised. Pathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed abundant giant cells. On the second hospital day, the calcium level was 12.6 mg per deciliter 3.2 mmol per liter and the parathyroid hormone PTH level was 396 pg per milliliter reference range, 10 to 60. A diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Primary hyperparathyroidism and brown tumor. ", "prediction": "1. Central Giant Cell Granuloma: This diagnosis is highly likely given the presence of a mandibular mass with giant cells, consistent with findings from the biopsy and pathological examination.\n2. Hyperparathyroidism: Elevated calcium and parathyroid hormone levels suggest a possible parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia, contributing to the jaw mass.\n3. Brown Tumor of Hyperparathyroidism: This condition could present as a lytic bone lesion due to prolonged hyperparathyroidism, characterized by osteoclastic activity and giant cells.\n4. Osteosarcoma: Although less likely, a lytic and expansile lesion with cortical involvement and a rapidly enlarging mass could indicate a malignant bone tumor like osteosarcoma.\n5. Cherubism: This rare genetic disorder presents with bilateral jaw swelling and may mimic the described presentation, particularly in younger patients.\n6. Aneurysmal Bone Cyst: The radiological appearance of an expansile lesion with internal septations could be due to an aneurysmal bone cyst.\n7. Fibrous Dysplasia: This condition can present with bone expansion and a lytic lesion with fibro-osseous features, potentially including giant cells.\n8. Eosinophilic Granuloma: A solitary lytic bone lesion in a young patient could indicate this form of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, although rare.\n9. Infectious Sialadenitis: Even though less consistent with a giant cell granuloma, chronic infection could cause swelling that mimics the described mass.\n10. Metastatic Bone Disease: Unlikely but possible, especially given the family history of various cancers, although typically such metastases would be an uncommon cause in this age group."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: CME Dr. Ian D. Cooley Medicine: A 68-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of painful mouth ulcers and weight loss. The patient had been well until 6 weeks before the current admission, when painful mouth ulcers and neck pain developed. He was evaluated at an urgent care center. He had reduced range of motion of the neck due to pain with flexion, extension, and rotation, but there was no spinal tenderness. There were small ulcers on the lower lip and gingivae. Cyclobenzaprine and acyclovir were prescribed. Five weeks before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician in a clinic at this hospital. He reported that neck pain on the right side and oral ulcers had persisted and that several new oral ulcers had developed. He had no rash, eye pain, joint pain or swelling, dysuria or genital lesions, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. The examination was notable for several large ulcers on the lips and tongue Fig. 1A. Treatment with acyclovir was continued. A direct immunofluorescence assay of a swab of an oral ulcer was negative for herpes simplex virus HSV types 1 and 2 and for varicellazoster virus. Blood tests were negative for human immunodeficiency virus HIV types 1 and 2 and for syphilis; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was referred to the dermatology clinic for further evaluation of the oral ulcers. Before the patient could be evaluated in the dermatology clinic, his mouth ulcers and pain worsened. Four weeks before the current admission, he presented to the emergency department of this hospital. Erythema and watering of the left eye had developed, as had new skin lesions on the trunk and upper face. The examination revealed multiple ulcers on the lips and tongue Fig. 1B and two pink crusted papules with hemorrhage on the right temple. There were scattered pustules on the lower back and right flank. An ophthalmologic examination revealed a pinguecula on the nasal side of the right eye with mild surrounding inflammation but was otherwise normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of kidney- and liver-function tests. HLA typing was positive for the HLA-B51 allele; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was evaluated by the rheumatol-ogy and dermatology services. The decision was made to pursue a skin biopsy before an oral biopsy. A biopsy of a pustule on the patients back was performed, and examination of the specimen revealed mild spongiosis, neutrophilic granulomatous inflammation, and a superficial perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with neutrophils and occasional eosinophils. Colchi-cine was prescribed, along with oxycodone and lidocaine oral solution, for the treatment of a working diagnosis of Behcets disease. Outpatient follow-up with the rheumatology service was arranged. Three days after discharge from the emergency department, the patient reported that the oral ulcers had not abated. Treatment with predni-sone was started, and colchicine was continued. Two weeks before the current admission, the patient was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. Prednisone treatment had led to only transient healing of the oral ulcers. The patient had pain with eating and speaking and had lost 10 kg of body weight in 3 weeks. The neck pain, the eye watering, and several skin lesions had resolved. The examination revealed extensive ulceration of the upper and lower labial mucosa and of the ventrolateral surface of the tongue on both sides, as well as two focal ulcerations, measuring 0.5 cm in diameter, involving the soft palate on the left side Fig. 1C and 1D. There were multiple purple-red, scaly papules involving the skin of the arms and lower legs. There was no evidence of a joint abnormality. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Prednisone was switched to oral methylpredniso-lone, and treatment with amoxicillinclavulanate was started for possible bowel-associated derma-tosisarthritis syndrome. Omeprazole, which the patient had taken for many years, was stopped because of peripheral eosinophilia. An evaluation in the oral medicine clinic at an affiliated hospital was arranged, with plans for oral and skin biopsies. One week before the current admission, a biopsy of lower labial mucosa revealed squamous mucosa and parenchyma of the minor salivary glands, with mild nonspecific chronic inflammation. A skin biopsy was notable for epidermal ulceration with impetiginization and associated folliculitis. Dexamethasone oral rinses were prescribed, as was trimethoprimsulfamethoxa-zole for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci infection. During the next 7 days, the ulcers worsened and the patient had ongoing pain that was unresponsive to oxycodone. He was unable to eat and was admitted to this hospital for pain control and further evaluation. The patients medical history included gastro-esophageal reflux disease. Medications included methylprednisolone, colchicine, amoxicillin clavulanate, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, lorazepam, and oxycodone, as well as dexa-methasone oral rinses. The patient was allergic to clarithromycin, which had caused a rash. He had quit smoking 30 years earlier, and he consumed 10 alcoholic drinks per week. There was no illicit drug use. The patient lived with his wife in a suburban area of New England. He had traveled to Western Europe, Mexico, and the Caribbean. He was employed part-time as a contractor. His family history included prostate cancer in his father and type 2 diabetes mellitus in his mother. On examination, the temperature was 35.8C, the blood pressure 134/56 mm Hg, the heart rate 70 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 26.4. The patient looked uncomfortable, with an edematous tongue and multiple oral ulcers. There was no cervical lymphadenopa-thy or joint abnormality. Skin examination revealed a slightly raised pustule, measuring 2 mm in diameter, on the anterior aspect of the thigh. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Markus Y. Wu: Computed tomography CT of chest and abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed subtle centrilobular ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes of the lungs, as well as prominent right hilar and left supraclavicular lymph nodes, each measuring 1 cm in diameter Fig. 2.

Stevens Emergency Medicine: A 38-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of altered mental status and a seizure. The patient had been in his usual state of health until the night before the current evaluation. His wife reported that he fell out of bed at approximately 4 a.m. and was on the floor shaking. He appeared confused and was speaking gibberish. Police were called to the patients apartment, and emergency medical services were activated. On evaluation at the patients home, a fingerstick blood glucose measurement was 110 mg per deciliter 6.1 mmol per liter. The patient was combative and disoriented, and he actively resisted being placed in the ambulance. On arrival at the emergency department, he had a witnessed generalized tonicclonic seizure, lasting 2 minutes, for which lorazepam was administered intravenously. A limited history was obtained from the patients wife, brother, and sister-in-law. The patient had not been ill recently and had no history of seizures or cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or neurologic disorders. His medical history was notable for a laparoscopic appendectomy. The patient took no medications and had no known adverse reactions to medications. He worked in environmental maintenance at a local business. He lived with his wife, daughter, and son. He had immigrated to Boston from a rural area of Guatemala approximately 20 years earlier. He rarely drank alcohol and did not use tobacco or illicit drugs. There was no known family history of seizure disorder or other neurologic disease. The temperature was 36.4C, the heart rate 120 beats per minute, the blood pressure 171/90 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95 while the patient was using a nonrebreather mask. His eyes were open, and an involuntary upward gaze was noted; the pupils were 4 mm, symmetric, and reactive to light. He did not verbally respond to questions or follow commands. Gag and cough reflexes were normal. He withdrew his arms and legs in response to pain, and a jerking motion of the head was noted. The score on the Glasgow Coma Scale was 6 on a scale of 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating greater alteration of consciousness. The neck was supple. Peripheral reflexes were normal. The toes were downgoing bilaterally. Scant blood was observed in the mouth, without visible lacerations. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of albumin, globulin, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, lipase, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, and troponin T were normal, as were the prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and results of liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A blood specimen was obtained to test for strongyloides antibodies. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 114 beats per minute but was otherwise normal. Seven minutes after the first dose, a second dose of lorazepam was administered intravenously for suspected continued seizure activity. The patient remained confused and agitated, and an endotracheal tube was placed for airway protection. A chest radiograph was normal, with the endotracheal tube in an appropriate position. A diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Seizure from neurocysticercosis. ", "prediction": "1.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Mubeen A. Shakir Medicine: A 50-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of pain in the left upper quadrant and hypoxemia. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 1 year before this admission, when fatigue and weight loss developed and she had abnormal results on liver-function tests after undergoing cholecystectomy for presumed acalculous cholecystitis. Computed tomography CT of the abdomen, which was performed as part of the evaluation to determine the cause of the abnormal liver-function test results, revealed hepatosplenomegaly Fig. 1A. Seven months before this admission, a submandibular mass and swelling developed; 1 month later, examination of a biopsy specimen of the mass revealed granulomatous sialadenitis. A liver biopsy was performed to investigate the patients abdominal distention, poor appetite, and persistently abnormal liver-function test results, which were suggestive of cholestasis. The liver-biopsy specimen showed evidence of granulomatous hepatitis; portal and periportal nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation that was associated with multinucleated giant cells, lymphocytes, and some plasma cells; and stage 1 to 2 portal and periportal fibrosis. Special stains for organisms acid-fast and Grocott methenaminesilver stains were negative. CT of the chest revealed minimal bibasilar atelectasis and a trace left pleural effusion. An interferon- release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Tests for histoplasma species, blastomyces species, cryptococcus species, coccidioides species, the human immunodeficiency virus HIV, and hepatitis A, B, and C viruses were all negative, as was testing for antinuclear antibodies, antimitochondrial antibodies, and antismooth muscle antibodies. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made on the basis of the biopsy results of the submandibular gland and liver and the presence of hypercalcemia and an elevated angiotensin-convertingenzyme level. Four months before this admission, prednisone therapy was initiated at a dose of 40 mg per day; subsequently, there was a marked reduction in the patients abdominal distention and marked improvement in her appetite. Liver-function test results also improved. Methotrexate therapy was started at a dose of 15 mg per week, with plans to taper the dose of prednisone. Three months before this admission, the patient stopped prednisone therapy because of irritability and insomnia. One month later, routine monitoring of the patients liver function revealed worsening liver-function test results in a cholestatic pattern. This finding was attributed to undertreatment of sarcoidosis, but the patient declined to restart prednisone; the dose of metho-trexate was increased to 25 mg per week. During the next month, the patient noted fatigue, slowly progressive dyspnea on exertion, and cough, without fever or chills. She was evaluated by her primary care physician 1 month before this admission, and a chest radiograph showed bilateral, perihilar, diffuse, symmetric ground-glass opacities with scattered patchy opacities at the lung bases Fig. 1B and 1C. Levo-floxacin was administered. Three weeks before this admission, CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed worsening hepato-splenomegaly. Prednisone therapy was started at a dose of 20 mg per day. On the morning of admission, the patient was awakened from sleep by severe, sharp pain in the left upper quadrant. The pain was not worse with eating, and she reported no nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Because of persistent pain throughout the day, she presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported progressive dyspnea on exertion and being unable to climb stairs in her home. There was no chest pain, edema in the legs, weight gain, or orthopnea. She had a cough that was productive of clear sputum but had no fevers or chills. The patient had a history of preeclampsia, Helicobacter pylori infection, cholecystectomy, and papillary thyroid cancer for which she had undergone hemithyroidectomy 9 years before this admission. In addition to methotrexate and pred-nisone, her medications included omeprazole and trazodone. Her father had hypertension and hy-perlipidemia, and one son had ulcerative colitis. Both maternal grandparents had had tuberculosis, but the patient had not had contact with them; her mother had latent tuberculosis. The patient had no known drug allergies. She worked as an administrative assistant and lived with her husband and children in a suburb of Boston. She had never smoked tobacco, did not use illicit drugs, and previously drank one glass of wine per week before her diagnosis of sarcoidosis. She had not traveled outside the United States in the past 5 years. On examination, the temperature was 36.7C, the blood pressure 112/56 mm Hg, the pulse 128 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 85 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 21. The patient was awake and alert but appeared fatigued. The first and second heart sounds S1 and S2 were normal, without murmurs; the jugular venous pressure, which was measured from the approximate midpoint of the right atrium, was 6 cm of water. Crackles were present in the middle and lower lung fields bilaterally. Normal bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft and nondistended, with tenderness in the left upper quadrant. The liver edge was palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin; the spleen tip was also palpable. There was no edema in the legs. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 93. The blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and lactate were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The level of alanine aminotrans-ferase was 38 IU per liter reference range, 7 to 33, and the levels of aspartate aminotransferase and total bilirubin were normal. The blood level of alkaline phosphatase was 268 IU per liter reference range, 30 to 100. Streptococcus pneu-moniae and Legionella pneumophila antigens were not detected in the urine. The blood level of 1,3--d-glucan was less than 31 pg per milliliter reference value, 60; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Victorine V. Muse: CT of the abdomen and pelvis Fig. 2A and 2B, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed hepatosplenomegaly with a hypodense wedge-shaped region in the midpole of the spleen. A portable anteroposterior chest radio-graph Fig. 2C showed progressive coalescing consolidations in the middle and lower lobes with diffuse ground-glass opacities. CT of the chest Fig. 2D, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy and confirmed the presence of multifocal confluent areas of airspace consolidation, with a background of diffuse ground-glass opacities. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism or pleural effusions. Dr. Shakir: The patient was admitted to the hospital. Treatment with prednisone, methotrex-ate, and omeprazole was stopped, and trazodone was continued. On hospital day 2, the temperature rose to 39.1C, the respiratory rate increased to 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation decreased to 89 while she was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute. Supplemental oxygen was increased to a rate of 5 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 93. Cultures of the blood were obtained. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. ", "prediction": "1. Sarcoidosis relapse: The discontinuation of prednisone might have led to a relapse of sarcoidosis, causing worsening pulmonary and hepatic symptoms as well as hypoxemia.\n2. Drug-induced pneumonitis: Methotrexate, a medication known to cause lung toxicity, could explain the patient's progressive dyspnea, cough, and ground-glass opacities on imaging.\n3. Pulmonary infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to methotrexate and recent prednisone use raises the possibility of an atypical or opportunistic lung infection.\n4. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: Exposure to an environmental antigen may result in an immune-mediated lung reaction, presenting with dyspnea, ground-glass opacities, and lung crackles.\n5. Pulmonary embolism: Though not evident on CT, the patient's hypoxemia and sudden left upper quadrant pain warrant considering pulmonary embolism.\n6. Heart failure: Although there is no clear cardiac history, the patient's tachycardia, hypoxemia, and crackles could suggest heart failure exacerbation.\n7. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis: This vasculitis can present with granulomatous inflammation, respiratory symptoms, and abnormal liver tests, similar to the patient's presentation.\n8. Lymphoma: The new mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, along with systemic symptoms and organomegaly, could indicate a hematologic malignancy.\n9. Tuberculosis: Despite negative initial tests, her family history and the presence of granulomatous inflammation suggest a re-evaluation for tuberculosis.\n10.

Winkler: A 22-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of pain and rapidly spreading erythema of the left hand. The patient had been well until the day of admission, when he awoke with pain and swelling of the left hand that involved the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger. Over a period of several hours, the pain progressed and bullae began to form. He began to have pain with movement of the second and fourth fingers, and the bullae turned dark purple; these changes prompted the patient to present to the emergency department of this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient reported pain of the left hand that worsened with movement of the second and fourth fingers. There was no lethargy, fatigue, headache, dyspnea, cough, or pain elsewhere. The patient had no notable medical history and had been well before the day of presentation. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 38.6C, the blood pressure 126/63 mm Hg, the heart rate 101 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while he was breathing ambient air. There were two violaceous, tender bullae on the dorsal aspect of the left hand  one on the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and one on the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger, each measuring 7 mm by 3 mm Fig. 1. In addition, there was nontender, streaking erythema spreading across the dorsal aspect of the left hand, the volar aspect of the left forearm, and the medial aspect of the left upper arm into the axilla. There was no axillary lymphadenopathy. On further examination of the left arm, the soft-tissue compartments were soft and compressible, without evidence of crepitus. Finger flexion and extension were intact but limited by pain and swelling in the second and fourth fingers. Results of motor and sensory examinations were normal. The hand was warm. The radial pulse was palpable, and the capillary refill was brisk. The remainder of the overall physical examination was unremarkable. A blood specimen was obtained for cul-ture, a complete blood count, and a metabolic panel. Initial laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Arvin Kheterpal: Computed tomography CT of the left hand and arm, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed focal soft-tissue swelling overlying the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger on the dorsal aspect of the left hand Fig. 2. There was no evidence of osseous erosion, periosteal reaction, fracture, joint effusion, fluid collection, or subcutaneous air. The left forearm had a normal appearance on imaging. Dr. Winkler: While the patient was in the emergency department, additional history was obtained. The patient was not taking any medications and had no known allergies to medications. He had recently graduated from college and was seeking employment. He lived with his parents in a suburban area of New England. There was no history of recent travel or sick contacts. He rarely drank alcohol and did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs. There was no notable family history. The patient had recently begun practicing taxidermy as a new hobby. Four days before presentation, he received a frozen deer hide from a friend, which he began to prepare for tanning. When he first received the deer hide, he scraped the skin and fur to remove numerous ticks. On the day before presentation, he kneaded the hide with his hands and massaged into it a mixture of deer brain and tap water that had been prepared the day before and left to stand overnight. While the patient was working with the animal hide, he did not wear protective clothing or gloves. His mother had assisted in part of the process but remained well. Intravenous fluid, ceftriaxone, and vancomy-cin were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Consultants from the orthopedic hand service, dermatology, and infectious diseases evaluated the patient. A diagnostic test was performed.

Cellulitis: The rapidly spreading erythema and pain in the left hand, along with the presence of bullae, are indicative of a severe bacterial skin infection, possibly due to the Streptococcus or Staphylococcus species.\n2. Necrotizing fasciitis: The rapid progression of symptoms including pain, swelling, and purple bullae can suggest a more severe soft tissue infection involving the fascia, requiring urgent intervention.\n3. Vibrio vulnificus infection: The patient's exposure to a deer hide and the presence of violaceous bullae suggest an infection by this bacteria, which is known for causing severe skin and soft-tissue infections.\n4. Herpetic whitlow: The bullae formation and significant pain, although less common, can be caused by a herpes simplex virus infection.\n5. Tularemia: Given the patient’s exposure to an animal hide, Francisella tularensis infection should be considered, as it can cause skin ulceration and regional lymphadenopathy.\n6. Anthrax: Bacillus anthracis infection should be considered due to the patient’s handling of animal hides and the severe cutaneous symptoms.\n7. Erysipelas: A superficial but rapidly spreading skin infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes could present with redness and swelling similar to the patient's symptoms.\n8. Sporotrichosis: The exposure to organic matter and animal hide, along with the cutaneous presentation, is consistent with an infection by Sporothrix schenckii, a type of fungal infection.\n9. Lyme disease: The patient’s direct contact with ticks from the deer hide raises the possibility of Borrelia burgdorferi infection, which can sometimes present with localized skin changes and inflammation.\n10.

Memel Medicine: A 60-year-old man presented to this hospital because of fevers, fatigue, arthralgias, a mouth ulcer, and a rash. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 1 month before the current presentation, when sore throat, fever, and fatigue developed while he was visiting relatives in the Southwest region of the United States. The symptoms persisted despite regular use of acetaminophen. Two weeks before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of a local hospital in the Southwest, where a test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coro-navirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 was reportedly negative. Oral amoxicillinclavulanic acid and doxycycline were prescribed, and the patient was discharged home. Ten days before the current presentation, a tongue ulcer developed, along with dry scaly nodules on the face and hands and migratory arthralgias in the wrists, fingers, elbows, and shoulders. Because of worsening symptoms, the patient returned home to Boston by airplane. When he landed in Boston, the patient felt too weak to stand, and an ambulance was called to transport him to this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing fevers, fatigue, arthralgias, and sore throat. He had lost 4.5 kg over a 1-month period. He had no eye redness or pain, genital ulcers, shortness of breath, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or headache. There was no notable medical history, and the patient had not been taking any regular medications before this illness. He had completed a course of oral amoxicillinclavulanic acid and doxycycline the day before presentation, and he had been taking acetaminophen for the past month. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was born in China and had immigrated to the United States 20 years earlier. He lived with his wife in Boston. He had not traveled internationally for more than 10 years. The patient had previously worked in environmental maintenance but was retired. He had no history of exposure to animals or fresh water and no sick contacts. He had not been sexually active for several years. He was a smoker with a 30-pack-year history, and he drank alcohol socially; there was no injection-drug use. His family history included colon cancer in his father, lung cancer in his mother, pancreatic cancer in his sister, and hepa-tocellular carcinoma in his brother. On examination, the temperature was 37.8C, the blood pressure 118/69 mm Hg, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 59 kg and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 19.2. The patient appeared unwell. There was no conjunctival injection. Oral mucous membranes were dry. There was a circular shallow ulcer on the lateral aspect of the tongue on the left side, as well as white plaque on the dorsal aspect of the tongue. There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The abdomen was soft and nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly. Strength was 45 in both shoulders. The remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. There were several small scaly nodules with a rim of patchy erythema on the fingers, an erosion with serosanguineous crust on the left elbow, and two erythematous and mildly violaceous nodules on the forehead Fig. 1. There were no genital lesions. Testing of a nasopharyngeal specimen for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative. The ferritin level was 3089 g per liter reference range, 20 to 300 and the creatine kinase level 505 U per liter reference range, 60 to 400. Urinalysis showed 2 ketones and 1 protein. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Karen Rodriguez: Chest radiography performed in the emergency department revealed bibasilar patchy opacities. Computed tomography CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed dependent reticular opacities throughout the lower lobes of the lungs Fig. 2. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a left adrenal nodule, measuring 1.2 cm in diameter. Dr. Memel: The patient was admitted to the hospital. Intravenous fluid and oral fluconazole were administered. Biopsies of skin lesions on the left elbow and left side of the forehead were performed. During the next 5 days, the fatigue, arthralgias, skin lesions, and mouth pain continued, and daily fevers with temperatures of up to 38.8C were recorded. The mouth lesion did not abate with the use of fluconazole, which was being administered for presumptive oral candi-diasis, and the agent was discontinued. Dr. Samantha N. Champion: Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen of the forehead lesion revealed vacuolar interface dermatitis with hyperkeratosis, dyskeratosis, pigment incontinence, and sparse perivascular chronic inflammation. Similar findings were observed on histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen of the elbow lesion. Dr. Memel: Cough developed, and pain in the left shoulder increased. On the fifth hospital day, the creatine kinase level was 906 U per liter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The next day, imaging studies of the left shoulder were obtained. Dr. Rodriguez: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the left shoulder, performed on hospital day 6, revealed patchy mild intramuscular edema that was most pronounced in the trape-zius and deltoid, a finding compatible with myo-sitis Fig. 2. There was no focal or organized fluid collection. Dr. Memel: On hospital day 10, biopsy of the left deltoid was performed with the patient under general anesthesia. In the 24 hours after the muscle biopsy, hypoxemia developed, and the patient received 3 liters of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula to maintain an oxygen saturation of more than 93. The next day, the patient received 8 liters of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies of the chest were obtained. Dr. Rodriguez: Repeat chest radiography revealed progressive patchy opacities at the lung bases. Repeat CT of the chest revealed progressive peribronchovascular and peripheral ground-glass and consolidative opacities predominantly involving the lower lobes, a finding consistent with organizing pneumonia Fig. 2. In addition, new small left and trace right pleural effusions were present. Dr. Memel: A diagnostic test was performed.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: CME at NEJM.org Dr. Gabrielle K. Bromberg: A 76-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain, anorexia, weight loss, memory impairment, and suicidal ideation. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 2 months before this admission, when she began having epigastric pain and anorexia associated with new constipation. Findings on upper and lower endoscopy were reportedly normal, as were the results of serologic testing for celiac disease. Fifteen days before this admission, the abdominal pain worsened. Ten days before this admission, the patient was admitted to another hospital because of diffuse abdominal pain associated with nausea and poor oral intake. On examination, the patient appeared pale. The abdomen was soft and nontender. The patient was alert and oriented to time, place, and person but had difficulty with word finding. Initial laboratory test results were notable for normocytic anemia and an elevated bilirubin level; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Ryan Chung: On admission to the other hospital, computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis Fig. 1A and 1B was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. There was evidence of a previous cholecys-tectomy, the common bile duct measured 7 mm in diameter reference range, 10 mm after cholecystectomy, and there was mild anasarca with diffuse mesenteric edema. On magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography Fig. 1C and 1D, the common bile duct again measured 7 mm in diameter; findings were otherwise normal. Dr. Bromberg: After admission to the other hospital, 1 unit of packed red cells was transfused, and the hemoglobin level remained stable thereafter. On the third hospital day, the patient could eat small amounts of food. On further questioning, the patient expressed suicidal ideation and reported a history of prolonged domestic abuse; she was evaluated by the psychiatry service. A diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder was made, and lorazepam was administered. The suicidal ideation resolved, but she was noted to need substantial assistance with self-care. While plans were being made for the patients discharge to an assisted-living facility, the constipation worsened, and her oral intake decreased. On the seventh hospital day, vomiting developed, and the laboratory evaluation was notable for hyponatremia, with a blood sodium level of 120 mmol per liter reference range, 135 to 145. A nasogastric tube was placed, and 3 hypertonic saline was administered intravenously. On the eighth day at the other hospital, additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Chung: Repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis Fig. 1E and 1F, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple dilated, fluid-filled loops of small bowel that measured up to 4 cm in diameter and the presence of airfluid levels and an abrupt transition point in the right lower quadrant. Dr. Bromberg: Urine specimens had been sent for measurement of urinary porphyrin levels at the time of admission to the other hospital; the resulting levels were elevated Table 1, and the patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation. On admission to this hospital, the patient reported persistent abdominal pain, constipation, and anorexia. The vomiting had resolved after insertion of the nasogastric tube. She reported weight loss of 18 kg over the course of the previous 4 months while she was following a limited diet. In an effort to improve the patients overall health, the patients daughter had provided her with supplements and recommended a ketogenic diet consisting of protein and cooked vegetables. The patient also reported that she had been having difficulty with memory for 2 months before this admission. The patient had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and glaucoma. Her surgical history included remote cholecystectomy and hysterectomy. Medications included panto-prazole, ondansetron, and calcium carbonate in combination with cholecalciferol. The patient was allergic to ampicillin, penicillin, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, tetracycline, eryth-romycin, nitrofurantoin, and nortriptyline  all with unknown reactions. She lived with her sister in suburban New England and reported that she was recently separated from her husband owing to long-standing domestic abuse. The patient had two children. She did not have contact with her son, and her daughter lived in India but visited regularly. Her mother had died from breast cancer. Her father and son both had bipolar affective disorder. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. On examination, the temperature was 36.1C, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the blood pressure 125/55 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 18.5. The patient appeared cachec-tic. There was a nasogastric tube in place. The conjunctivae were pale. The abdomen was soft and diffusely tender, without guarding, rigidity, or rebound tenderness. There was no rash. The patient was alert but inconsistently oriented to time, place, and person. Her speech was tangential, and she was unable to recite days of the week backward. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hemoglobin level was 9.1 g per deciliter reference range, 12.0 to 16.0. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A peripheral-blood smear showed normochromic red cells with occasional burr cells and no schistocytes. Reticulocytes, basophilic stippling, and rare nucleated red cells were present; there were no blasts, and the white cells were morphologically normal. Dr. Chung: Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant revealed mildly increased echogenicity and mild coarsening of the liver parenchyma Fig. 2. The common bile duct measured 5 mm in diameter. Dr. Bromberg: Intravenous fluids and hemin were administered. On the third hospital day, the volume of output from the nasogastric tube remained elevated. The patient underwent surgical exploration for possible small-bowel obstruction. Dilated loops of small bowel with a transition point near the terminal ileum were observed; there was a loop of small bowel tethered underneath an adhesion band around which the cecum had volvulized. The adhesion was lysed, and the loop of small bowel released. There was no mass or stricture. A diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Lead poisoning. ", "prediction": "1. Acute Intermittent Porphyria: The elevated urinary porphyrin levels, abdominal pain, constipation, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and family history of bipolar disorder strongly suggest an acute porphyria.\n2. Small Bowel Obstruction: The imaging findings of dilated, fluid-filled loops of small bowel with an abrupt transition point are highly indicative of a small bowel obstruction.\n3. Hypovitaminosis B12: The patient's memory impairment, pallor, and tangential speech may be due to vitamin B12 deficiency, especially given her limited diet.\n4. Pancreatic Insufficiency: The weight loss, malnutrition, and abdominal pain along with diffuse mesenteric edema may indicate pancreatic insufficiency, more so since the patient is on a ketogenic diet with limited food intake.\n5. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): The documented history of prolonged domestic abuse and recent suicidal ideation are consistent with PTSD, contributing to some of her diverse symptoms.\n6. Hyponatremia: The extremely low blood sodium level and corresponding symptoms like confusion and poor oral intake suggest complications secondary to hyponatremia.\n7. Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia: Significant weight loss, anorexia, and abdominal pain exacerbated by eating could indicate chronic mesenteric ischemia.\n8. Major Depressive Disorder: The patient's reported history of memory loss, weight loss, and suicidal ideation could also be indicative of major depressive disorder.\n9. Medication-induced Effects: The varied symptoms might also be due to adverse effects from her multiple medications, including pantoprazole and ondansetron, exacerbated by her advanced age and comorbidities.\n10. Celiac Disease: Despite normal serologic testing, the nonspecific symptoms of gastrointestinal distress and weight loss warrant reconsideration of celiac disease, given its variable presentation."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: CME at NEJM.org Dr. Viral S. Shah: A 26-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of respiratory failure and altered mental status. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 days before the current admission, when she underwent elective abdominoplasty and liposuction at an ambulatory surgery center. During the procedure, anesthetic agents included intravenous propofol, fentanyl, midazolam, and ketamine, as well as local lidocaine injections. During recovery after the procedure, medications included intravenous cefazolin, enoxaparin, and ondansetron; oral oxycodone, tramadol, and gabapen-tin; and transdermal scopolamine. The patient was lethargic after the procedure but was able to be discharged home after a period of observation. Later that day, the patient was instructed by telephone to take a lower dose of postoperative oxycodone. The next day, on evaluation at the surgical center, she was found to be somnolent but arousable and able to answer questions with effort; the scopolamine patch was removed. Several hours after the patient returned home, her family noticed that she had increased respiratory effort and minimal responsiveness. She was taken by ambulance to the emergency department of a local hospital. In the emergency department, the temperature was 37.7C, the heart rate 130 beats per minute, the blood pressure 121/77 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 83 while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was lethargic, moaned intermittently, and responded with one-word answers; symmetric movement in the arms and legs was observed. Intravenous naloxone was administered, with minor improvement in her condition. Levels of electrolytes and results of kidney- and liver-function tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, rightward axis deviation, and nonspecific STT-wave changes. Dr. Dexter P. Mendoza: A chest radiograph showed diffuse confluent opacities in both lungs Fig. 1A. Computed tomography CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material as part of a pulmonary-embolism protocol, ruled out pulmonary embolism but revealed diffuse mixed ground-glass and consolidative opacities involving all lobes of the lungs, with relative sparing of the subpleural lung Fig. 1B. CT of the abdomen revealed postoperative changes. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed mild effacement of the cerebral sulci and cisterns on both sides, a finding suggestive of mild diffuse cerebral edema Fig. 1C and 1D. There was also a small hypodensity in the left globus pal-lidus, a finding suggestive of infarction. Dr. Shah: Noninvasive bilevel positive airway pressure was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit ICU at the other hospital. Intravenous vancomycin, piperacil-lintazobactam, levofloxacin, and oseltamivir were administered empirically, and a triple-lumen central venous catheter was inserted. The next morning, the findings on a repeat chest radiograph appeared to be unchanged, but the patient had progressive lethargy, so intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Pink frothy secretions were noted. Intravenous methylprednisolone, propofol, and norepinephrine were administered. A nucleic acid test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coro-navirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 was negative. The tropo-nin I level increased to 4.31 ng per milliliter reference range, 0.029. The thyrotropin, car-boxyhemoglobin, and lipase levels were normal, and tests for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigens were negative. Later that afternoon, the patient was transferred to the ICU at this hospital. A review of systems was unavailable because intubation was performed on arrival. Medical history that was obtained from family members included iron-deficiency anemia, anxiety disorder, insomnia, and two normal spontaneous vaginal deliveries. Regular medications included lorazepam as needed for sleep; postoperative medications included tramadol, gabapentin, and oxycodone as needed for pain. There were no known adverse reactions to medication. The patient had attended college and worked in an office. She lived with her husband and children. She drank alcohol intermittently and did not use tobacco or other substances. There was no family history of cardiopulmonary or neurologic disorders. The temperature was 36.6C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 118/78 mm Hg while the patient was receiving norepinephrine at a rate of 8 g per minute. The height was 168 cm and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 27.8. The oxygen saturation was 99 while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator in volume-control mode tidal volume, 320 ml; positive end-expiratory pressure, 12 cm of water; respiratory rate, 18 breaths per minute; fraction of inspired oxygen, 1.0. The pupils were 2 mm and symmetrically reactive. The lung sounds were coarse. The abdominal incision was well approximated and without drainage; abdominal drains were in place on both sides. A neurologic examination with interruption of sedation showed spontaneous eye-opening but an inability to visually track and to follow commands. Brain-stem reflexes were intact. The legs withdrew equally and briskly in response to pain. The remainder of the examination was normal. A chest radiograph showed diffuse opacities in both lungs. Levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, alanine aminotransfer-ase, bilirubin, creatine kinase, lipase, and ammonia were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable. Urine toxico-logic screening was negative except for the presence of opiates. Specimens of blood and urine were obtained for microbiologic culture. An electrocardiogram including posterior leads showed sinus rhythm, rightward axis deviation, diminutive Q waves, and minor nonspecific STT-wave abnormalities. An abdominal radiograph showed a nonspecific bowel gas pattern, subcutaneous emphysema, and surgical drains over the pelvis. On bedside cardiac ultrasonography, the left ventricle could not be visualized clearly, but right ventricular dilatation did not appear to be present. Intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and metroni-dazole were administered. Dr. Mendoza: CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed hypodensities in the left basal ganglia and right cerebellum that were suggestive of infarcts; the previously described cerebral edema had reduced slightly. A CT angiogram of the head and neck was normal. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a reduction in ground-glass opacities but an increase in consolidations, particularly in the lower lobes. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a small anterior abdominal hematoma and diffuse subcutaneous emphysema. Dr. Shah: A neurology consultation was obtained; aspirin and atorvastatin were administered. On hospital day 2, the findings on neuro-logic examination worsened, with only sluggish eye-opening and no motor responses to noxious stimuli. Intravenous mannitol at a dose of 1 g per kilogram of body weight was administered. Dr. Mendoza: Repeat CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed a hypodensity in the left glo-bus pallidus that had not changed from the previous study, as well as a hypodensity in the right cerebellum that was not definitive and was probably an artifact. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head showed infarcts within the globi pallidi and smaller punctate infarcts in the cerebral white matter. There were also innumerable diffuse microhemorrhagic foci affecting the cerebral white matter, including the corpus cal-losum Fig. 2. Dr. Shah: Bronchoscopy revealed bloody mucus in the distal trachea Fig. 3. Serial bronchoal-veolar lavage BAL performed in the right upper lobe revealed increasingly erythematous effluent. Lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies were not detected. Levels of C3 and C4 were normal. Tests for antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Tests for legionella, streptococcus, and galactomannan urinary antigens and antitrepo-nemal antibodies were negative, as was a repeat nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2. Dr. Yasmin Aghajan: On hospital day 3, the pa-tient underwent continuous electroencephalographic monitoring. The study was abnormal because of generalized rhythmic delta activity at a frequency of 1 Hz, which occasionally evolved to generalized periodic discharges superimposed on a disorganized background with irregular delta and theta slowing. There were no epilepti-form abnormalities. Although generalized rhythmic delta activity and generalized periodic discharges are on the ictalinterictal continuum, there were no features suggestive of seizures. The electroencephalographic findings were consistent with encephalopathy and the effects of propofol. A diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Fat embolism syndrome. ", "prediction": "1. **Postoperative Drug Overdose**: The patient's symptoms of altered mental status and respiratory failure following the use of multiple sedatives and analgesics (including opioids) raise suspicion for a drug overdose or interaction.\n2. **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)**: The bilateral diffuse pulmonary opacities, need for high oxygen supplementation, and pink frothy secretions are indicative of ARDS, possibly secondary to the surgical procedure or sepsis.\n3. **Sepsis/Septic Shock**: The patient’s tachycardia, high respiratory rate, use of norepinephrine, and need for broad-spectrum antibiotics such as vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole suggest a severe systemic infection leading to sepsis.\n4. **Fat Embolism Syndrome**: Post-abdominoplasty and liposuction, the findings of petechial rash, neurologic alterations, and hypoxemia are consistent with fat embolism syndrome.\n5. **Pulmonary Edema**: The presence of bilateral lung opacities and pink frothy sputum suggests non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema possibly due to acute lung injury.\n6. **Toxic Metabolic Encephalopathy**: The patient’s presentation with altered mental status, EEG abnormalities, and systemic metabolic derangements point towards toxic metabolic encephalopathy, potentially from drug toxicity or sepsis.\n7. **Cerebral Infarction/Stroke**: The CT and MRI findings of hypodensities in the brain regions including globus pallidus and basal ganglia are consistent with the possibility of cerebral infarction or stroke.\n8. **Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)**: The MRI findings of diffuse microhemorrhagic foci and white matter infarcts could suggest a post-infectious or post-vaccination inflammatory process like ADEM.\n9. **Pulmonary Hemorrhage**: Bronchoscopic findings of bloody mucus and erythematous effluent indicate potential pulmonary hemorrhage which could be linked to systemic conditions or coagulopathies.\n10. **Meningoencephalitis**: Although no direct evidence of infection was found, the generalized EEG slowing and altered mental status might suggest an underlying infectious or autoimmune meningoencephalitis."}

Raju Pediatrics: A 9-year-old boy was transferred to this hospital because of transient weakness and facial droop on the left side and slurred speech. The patient had been well until 5 hours before this evaluation, when his parents observed that he had a facial droop on the left side and slurred speech. In addition, the patient noticed that his left arm and leg felt limp. When he moved to get out of his bed, he could not stand on his own or grip using the left hand. There was no confusion, loss of consciousness, shaking in the arms or legs, urinary or fecal incontinence, headache, nausea, vomiting, recent illness, or trauma. The symptoms lasted approximately 2 minutes and then resolved completely. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital. At the other hospital, the physical examination was reportedly normal. The complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and troponin were normal, as were the results of tests of renal, liver, and thyroid function. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation. On arrival at this hospital, additional history was obtained from the patients parents. Earlier in the day, the patient had become upset while visiting his grandfather, who was dying of esophageal cancer. He then played a game of hockey with a sibling; no falls or head trauma occurred. At the time that his parents observed the new neurologic symptoms, he had been lying in bed and crying profusely and inconsolably for an extended period. His parents noticed that he was gasping for air and hiccupping while crying. The patient had been born by normal spontaneous vaginal delivery at full term. He had met normal developmental milestones and had received routine childhood vaccinations. He had chronic gastrointestinal upset that had been attributed to anxiety. Two years earlier, he had been evaluated at the neurology clinic of another hospital because of episodes of shaking in the arms and legs, which occurred multiple times a day. The shaking occurred more frequently when the patient was excited or emotional. He was aware of the shaking; he felt an urge before each episode, and the urge was relieved after the shaking occurred. His parents were told that the shaking was stereotypy, and no diagnostic tests were performed. The patient took no medications and had no known drug allergies. He lived with his parents and two siblings in a suburban area of New England. He attended elementary school and performed well academically, although he received tutoring for mild difficulties with reading and phonology. In addition to the history of esophageal cancer in his paternal grandfather, his father had ulcerative colitis, his mother had received a diagnosis of large-B-cell lymphoma in childhood, his sister had asthma, and his maternal grandfather had died of acute coronary syndrome at 30 years of age. On evaluation, the patient appeared well developed and mildly anxious. The temperature was 37.2C, the blood pressure 116/64 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while he was breathing ambient air. The face was symmetric, with normal forehead wrinkling, blinking, smiling, and cheek puffing. An evaluation of other cranial-nerve functions, sensation, power, bulk, tone, coordination, and gait was normal. A diagnostic test result was reviewed, and a diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Moyamoya disease. ", "prediction": "1. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA): A TIA can present with sudden, transient neurologic deficits such as weakness, facial droop, and slurred speech, which match the patient's symptoms.\n2. Hemiplegic Migraine: This type of migraine can cause temporary weakness or paralysis on one side of the body, along with slurred speech, without associated headache in some pediatric patients.\n3. Conversion Disorder: The presence of neurological symptoms triggered by emotional distress, as seen with the patient's crying and gasping episode, can point to a conversion disorder.\n4. Seizure Disorder: Although the current episode did not include shaking, the patient's history of arm and leg shaking points to a potential seizure disorder, which can sometimes manifest with focal neurological symptoms.\n5. Bell’s Palsy: Although less likely given the transient and fully resolving nature of the symptoms, Bell’s Palsy could present with facial droop, though usually it is not that short-lived.\n6. Anxiety Attack with Hyperventilation: Severe anxiety can cause hyperventilation leading to transient neurologic symptoms such as limb weakness and facial droop, possibly through hyperventilation-induced respiratory alkalosis.\n7. Pediatric Stroke: Despite the normal imaging and evaluation, pediatric stroke remains a possible yet rare cause of sudden neurological deficits.\n8. Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder: Given the history of symptoms in stressful situations and normal test results, functional neurological symptom disorder is a consideration.\n9. Hypoglycemia: Although unlikely given the normal blood glucose level on evaluation, transient neurological symptoms such as weakness and slurred speech could occur with fluctuating sugar levels.\n10.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Suma Babu: A 67-year-old man was evaluated in the sleep clinic at this hospital because of odd behaviors during sleep, daytime sleepiness, and apnea detected on a home sleep study. Three years before the current evaluation, the patients wife noticed that the patient had vocalizations, including talking and yelling, while sleeping. He also had thrashing movements while sleeping; he fell out of bed more than once and inadvertently hit his wife during these movements. Two years before the current evaluation, the patients wife noticed that the patient had prolonged episodes of daytime sleepiness. During the episodes, he appeared to fall asleep while sitting up and was unresponsive to shaking and loud voices; several hours later, he returned to normal interaction without any intervention. The daytime sleepiness was intermittent and fluctuated in severity. Four months before the current evaluation, the patient fell asleep while washing dishes. This resulted in a fall and unstable C1 spinal fracture, which required urgent surgical repair. After the surgical repair, melatonin and trazodone were prescribed for insomnia, and abnormal movements during sleep abated. However, vocalizations during sleep  including singing, talking, and expression of fear and anger in the context of upsetting dreams  continued and were most prominent in the early morning hours. The patient also had a motor neurologic syndrome that had started before the onset of sleep symptoms, approximately 3.5 years before the current evaluation. Symptoms included progressive gait imbalance with falls, hand clumsiness, hoarse voice, and dysphagia. Serial neurologic examinations, performed over a 3-year period by multiple neuromuscular specialists, revealed slow progression of generalized fasciculations and the development of bulbar hyperreflexia, postural instability, and hypophonia, although strength in the arms and legs remained intact. Serial electromyography revealed progressive and widespread involvement of muscles showing chronic reinnervation changes, including eventual involvement of craniobulbar muscles tongue and masseter muscles. CME at NEJM.org Dr. Brian Zhao: One year before the current evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the cervical spine revealed moderate neural foraminal narrowing at the level of C3C4 bilaterally and no central canal stenosis. Four months before the current evaluation, MRI of the head revealed a punctate subacute infarct in the left posterior centrum semiovale, chronic infarcts in the left middle frontal gyrus and right cerebellum, and nonspecific moderate-to-severe white-matter changes Fig. 1. Dr. Babu: Blood tests for paraneoplastic, nutritional, and paraproteinemic causes of the patients neurologic syndrome were unrevealing. A diagnosis of slowly progressive motor neuron disease was made, and therapy with riluzole was begun. A videofluoroscopic swallowing study revealed severe oropharyngeal dysphagia with laryngeal penetration and silent aspiration; a gastrostomy tube was placed, and tube feeding was initiated. The patient underwent a home sleep-apnea test, which showed sleep-disordered breathing with an apneahypopnea index of 20 events per hour; hypoxemia was present at rest while he was breathing ambient air. Severe oxygen de-saturation occurred with frequent respiratory events while he was asleep in the supine position. The patient was then referred to the sleep clinic for an initial evaluation. On evaluation in the sleep clinic, the patient reported that obstructive sleep apnea had been diagnosed on the basis of a home sleep study performed 1 year earlier. Multiple attempts at treatment with continuous positive airway pressure CPAP had been unsuccessful; there had been difficulty in finding a mask that fit comfortably. In addition to the sleep and motor neurologic syndrome described previously, the patients symptoms included snoring, difficulty with sleep initiation, forgetfulness, poor judgment regarding his ability to safely complete physical tasks, urinary urgency and frequency, and night sweats. He had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was well controlled with insulin and had been complicated by mild, stable, length-dependent sensory polyneuropathy; other history included hyperlipidemia, a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation, depression, orthostatic hypotension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included alprazolam, bupropion, fenofibrate, insulin, melatonin, metformin, riluzole, sertraline, and trazodone; there were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in New England with his wife. He was a retired engineer. He drank two alcoholic beverages per day. He did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother had died from an unknown cause at an elderly age; his father had died from trauma. One of his brothers had cerebrovascular disease, and another had schizophrenia. On examination, the temperature was 36.6C, the blood pressure 112/60 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 24.2. The patient was awake, alert, and oriented, although his attention was somewhat diminished. He could recall two words out of three. Naming and repetition were intact. The pupils were equally reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements were intact, and visual fields were full. Facial sensation and strength were normal. Speech was hypophonic and mildly slurred. Elevation of the palate was symmetric, and movement of the tongue was normal. Shoulder shrug was symmetric. Strength was 55 in all muscle groups. Deep-tendon reflexes were brisk in the arms, with mild spasticity in the legs. Plantar responses were normal. Vibratory sensation in the legs was mildly diminished. Results of finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing were normal. There were mild myoclonic movements in both hands. Alternating movements were mildly clumsy. Tone was slightly increased in the legs. The gait was on a narrow base and was unsteady; the patient was unable to walk with a tandem gait. The Rom-berg test showed truncal titubation. A sleep study to determine the appropriate positive airway pressure PAP therapy was performed. In CPAP mode, there was good control of respiratory events. Electromyographic signals revealed elevated muscle tone during rapid-eye-movement REM sleep, but there were no abnormal behaviors. Two weeks later, during a follow-up visit in the neuromuscular clinic, the patient became unresponsive to sternal rub; the vital signs and blood glucose level were normal. He was transported to the emergency department, where he returned to a normal level of consciousness without intervention. Electroencephalography EEG revealed frequent intermittent diffuse polymorphic delta slowing of the background, often with bifrontal predominance, but showed no epileptiform abnormalities. The patient was fitted with a mask for CPAP, and treatment was initiated. Several weeks after the initiation of treatment, download of CPAP data revealed good effectiveness and adherence. However, episodes of unresponsiveness increased in frequency and lasted up to 3 hours at a time. During the episodes, the patients wife was unable to arouse him despite performing a sternal rub. Modafinil was prescribed, but the episodes did not abate. The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for long-term monitoring and EEG. During the admission, two episodes of unresponsiveness occurred, during which the patient had a normal blood pressure, heart rate, and glucose level and EEG revealed findings consistent with sleep. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Anti-IgLON5 IgG–associated neurologic disorder. ", "prediction": "1.

Perugino: A 70-year-old man was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of a recurrent left pleural effusion. Five years before this presentation, the patient had pain in the shoulders and proximal muscles of the arms and legs. The pain was worse in the morning and was associated with fatigue. There was no associated stiffness. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein level were elevated. Prednisone was initiated for the treatment of a working diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica, and symptoms abated quickly. During the next year, attempts to discontinue predni-sone led to recurrent myalgias, as well as elevations in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein level. Three years before this presentation, swelling, erythema, and pain developed in the cartilaginous portion of the left ear, sparing the earlobe Fig. 1. There was no reduction in these symptoms after empirical antibacterial therapy was initiated for the treatment of presumed cellulitis. The dose of prednisone was increased, and the symptoms involving the ear resolved; however, they recurred when the dose of prednisone was tapered. Biopsy of the left auricle revealed perichondrial inflammation and degenerative changes in the cartilage. The dose of prednisone was increased for a presumed diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis. The symptoms involving the ear resolved, and weekly therapy with methotrexate was initiated. During the next 6 months, attempts to taper the prednisone dose were associated with worsening inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms, along with elevations in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein level. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was as high as 89 mm per hour reference range, 0 to 13 and the C-reactive protein level as high as 73.6 mg per liter reference value, 8.0. Two years before this presentation, the patient began treatment with tocilizu-mab for fatigue, markedly elevated C-reactive protein level, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, all of which persisted despite treatment with prednisone and methotrexate. The administration of tocilizumab allowed for the tapering of prednisone to a lower dose without causing an exacerbation of inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms. Two weeks after the patient began receiving tocilizumab therapy, and upon tapering of the prednisone dose, pain and swelling developed in the right leg; ultrasound examination revealed a distal deep-vein thrombosis in the right posterior tibial vein. Repeat ultrasonogra-phy of the leg performed 2 weeks later did not show propagation of the deep-vein thrombosis, and the pain and swelling resolved with the continued use of a compression stocking and elevation of the right leg. However, 2 months later, when further tapering of the prednisone dose was started, inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms recurred, and pain and swelling developed in the left leg. Ultrasound examination revealed deep-vein thromboses in the left popliteal and left calf veins and in the right femoral vein; therapy with rivaroxaban was initiated. The development of recurrent deep-vein thromboses was attributed to the underlying inflammatory disease. The dose of prednisone was increased, methotrexate was continued, and tocilizumab was replaced with infliximab therapy. During the next 6 months, the inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms worsened when attempts were made to taper the prednisone dose, and these conditions abated only when the dose of prednisone was increased. Blood tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ANCAs, rheumatoid factor, and anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were negative. Fifteen months before this presentation, treatment with rituxi-mab was initiated. However, after an attempt to taper the dose of prednisone, bilateral scleritis developed Fig. 1; the dose of prednisone was increased again, which resulted in resolution of the ocular pain and redness. During the next 3 months, attempts to taper the prednisone dose resulted in recurrent episodes of scleritis and inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms; additional rituximab treatment was not administered. One year before the current presentation, treatment with low-dose cyclophosphamide was initiated, but the use of this medication was complicated by severe neutropenia, which did not allow for the dose to be escalated. Nine months before this presentation, treatment with cyclophosphamide was stopped, and intravenous tocilizumab was restarted, given its previous efficacy in this patient. However, the use of tocilizu-mab also resulted in moderate but transient neutropenia after each infusion. Seven months before this presentation, pleu-ritic chest pain on the lower left side developed, along with dyspnea on exertion and a dry cough. Chest radiography revealed a moderate left pleural effusion Fig. 2A and 2B. Thoracentesis was performed, and 1 liter of straw-colored pleural fluid was removed; laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Grams staining of the pleural fluid revealed abundant polymorphonuclear cells but no organisms; bacterial, fungal, and myco-bacterial cultures were without growth. Cytologic examination of the pleural fluid revealed no malignant cells. Computed tomography CT of the chest performed after the pleural fluid was drained showed a small left pleural effusion, a trace right pleural effusion, and bibasilar dependent atelectasis without consolidation, nodules, or lymphadenopathy Fig. 2C. The pleural effusions were attributed to ongoing inflammatory disease. The dose of prednisone was increased, and the pleurisy and dyspnea resolved. Five months before this presentation, tocilizumab therapy was stopped, and tofacitinib was initiated. One week before this presentation, the patient had sudden onset of back pain on the left side. Imaging studies were performed. Dr. Vincent V. Dinculescu: CT of the chest and abdomen, performed 6 months after the first CT of the chest, revealed a small left pleural effusion that was larger than it had been on the first chest CT Fig. 2D. A punctate stone in the lower pole of the left kidney was also observed, with no evidence of hydronephrosis. Dr. Perugino: The patient presented to the rheu-matology clinic for further evaluation. He had no dyspnea, cough, or fever. On examination, the temperature was 36.7C, the heart rate 64 beats per minute, the blood pressure 145/75 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 29.2. There was no scleral redness or erythema of the helix of the ear. The heart sounds were regular. Breath sounds were decreased at the base of the left lung. There was no leg edema, joint swelling or tenderness, pur-pura, petechiae, or deficits in motor strength. The patient had a history of mucinous adeno-carcinoma of the cecum, which had been diagnosed 10 years before this presentation and had been treated with laparoscopic colectomy of the right side of the colon and with oxaliplatin therapy, without evidence of recurrence. Other history included peripheral neuropathy attributed to the oxaliplatin therapy, hypothyroidism, and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Macrocytic anemia had been present for 3 years before this presentation, with normal blood levels of cobalamin and folate. The patient also had a history of leukopenia and neutropenia; these conditions had occurred intermittently over the course of the 10 years preceding this presentation but were most pronounced after treatment with cyclophosphamide and tocilizumab. Medications included alendro-nate, atorvastatin, cholecalciferol, folic acid, levo-thyroxine, methotrexate, omeprazole, prednisone, rivaroxaban, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, and tofacitinib. The patient drank alcohol occasionally; he did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. He lived in New England and was retired. There was no family history of autoimmune disease. The blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. Testing for antinuclear antibodies was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic test was performed, and management decisions were made.

The patient had been well until 2 weeks before this admission, when fatigue and fever developed on his final day of summer camp. He was taken to the primary care clinic at another hospital and was told that he had a viral infection. Nine days before this admission, new mild sore throat developed, and the patient returned to the primary care clinic. A throat culture for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus was reportedly negative. The patient was told that he had possible sinusitis, and treatment with amoxicillinclavulanate was started. During the next 3 days, the sore throat abated, but fatigue and fever persisted. Six days before this admission, new pain in the right shoulder and left knee developed, and the patient again returned to the primary care clinic. The white-cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were reportedly elevated; a blood test for Lyme disease was performed. On the day of admission, the joint pain progressed to involve the shoulders and knees on both sides, and the temperature increased to 39.4C. The patient was given ibuprofen and brought to the emergency department at this hospital. On evaluation, the patient described aching pain in the shoulders and knees, which was worst in his right shoulder and left knee. He rated the pain at 7 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He had not noticed redness, swelling, or stiffness of the joints. A review of systems was notable for chills, intermittent night sweats, headache, myalgias, and lightheadedness when he stood up from a sitting position. He had no weight loss, rash, vision changes, or respiratory symptoms. He had mild abdominal cramping, decreased appetite, and intermittent nausea. During the past week, there had been a few episodes of nonbloody emesis and watery diarrhea. There had been no hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena. The patient had autism spectrum disorder, with an early delay in speech development that had resolved after speech therapy. He had met milestones for gross CME at NEJM.org and fine motor skills and growth. He had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. Other history included asthma, seasonal rhinosinusitis, and allergies to peanuts and tree nuts; there were no known drug allergies. He had undergone a tonsillectomy in early childhood. Medications included amoxicillinclavula-nate, inhaled fluticasone, and ibuprofen and inhaled albuterol as needed. At the time of admission, the patient was on his summer break before entering high school. Earlier in the summer, he had gone on vacation to a coastal area of New England. He had also attended camp in a rural area of New England, where he camped and hiked in wooded areas and swam in fresh water. He had seen a tick on his clothing but did not recall any bites. Two weeks before this admission, the patient had returned to his home in a suburban area of New England, where he lived with his mother who was a veterinarian, father, sister, and pet dog. His sister had recently had an acute gastrointestinal illness that resolved after several days. The patient was not sexually active and did not use alcohol, drugs, or tobacco. His mother had hypothyroidism, and his maternal uncle had rheumatoid arthritis; there was no other known family history of autoimmune diseases. On examination, the temperature was 36.1C, the blood pressure 128/58 mm Hg, the heart rate 107 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 27.2. The patient appeared to be well developed and well nourished, but he looked tired. The conjunctivae were normal. The mucous membranes were dry, and there was an aphthous ulcer on the right buccal mucosa. The lungs were clear on auscultation. There was tenderness on palpation of the epigastric and periumbilical abdomen. There was no erythema, warmth, swelling, or crepitus of the large and small joints. There was tenderness on palpation, as well as pain with movement, of the right shoulder and knees; range of motion in these joints was not decreased. The patient had no rash or lymph-adenopathy. The white-cell count was 12,950 per micro-liter reference range, 4500 to 13,000, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 48 mm per hour reference range, 0 to 13, the C-reactive protein level 207.6 mg per liter reference range, 0.0 to 8.0, and the lipase level 82 U per liter reference range, 13 to 60. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. While the patient was in the emergency department, the temperature increased to 39.2C. Intravenous fluids were administered, and empirical treatment with doxycycline was started. The patient was admitted to the hospital. During the next 2 days, the fever resolved, but the joint pain, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea worsened in severity. On the third hospital day, fever recurred. The white-cell count was 15,190 per microliter, the C-reactive protein level 178.3 mg per liter, and the lipase level 145 U per liter. A fecal occult blood test was positive. A plain film of the right shoulder was normal. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease).

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Mia Y. Bothwell Medicine: A 55-year-old man was evaluated in the rheumatol-ogy clinic of this hospital because of bilateral hearing loss and eye redness. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 weeks before the current evaluation, when a headache involving the left temple developed. A similar headache had occurred during an episode of shingles 15 years earlier. He received a prescription for a 1-week course of valacyclovir for the treatment of presumed shingles. No skin lesions developed, and the headache resolved. Four weeks before the current evaluation, hearing loss in the left ear developed during an airplane flight. The hearing loss persisted after the flight, and the patient began to have intermittent tinnitus in the left ear and redness in both eyes. He was evaluated by an otolaryngologist at a clinic affiliated with this hospital. He reported no vertigo, otorrhea, rhinitis, or sore throat. On examination, there was redness in both eyes. The right and left auricles and external auditory canals were normal, as was the right tympanic membrane. The left tympanic membrane was retracted; there was no middle-ear effusion. Results of the Weber test were inconsistent. The Rinne test was positive bilaterally, with air conduction greater than bone conduction. There was no sinus tenderness. Nasopharyngoscopy revealed midseptal deviation to the left; the posterior aspect of the nasopharynx was normal. The remainder of the examination, including a cranial nerve examination, was normal. An audiogram showed sloping mild-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss in both ears. Results were asymmetric at low frequencies, with more severe hearing loss in the left ear than in the right ear from 125 to 2000 Hz Fig. 1A. Word recognition was 96 with the right ear and 84 with the left ear reference range, 80 to 100. Results of tympanometry were normal in both ears. The patient received a prescription for a 12-day tapering course of oral prednisone. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no abnormal findings. CME at NEJM.org Four weeks later, the patient was evaluated by a different otolaryngologist at the clinic affiliated with this hospital. Hearing loss had progressed. Eye redness had initially decreased after prednisone therapy was started but had subsequently recurred after prednisone therapy was stopped. On examination, there was redness in both eyes. There was no spontaneous nystagmus or gait ataxia. Sinusoidal gaze tracking was normal. The head-thrust test to the left was positive, a finding that indicates vestibular hypofunction on the left side. Results of the Romberg test were normal. The Fukuda step test was positive, with the patient rotated to the left, a finding that also indicates vestibular hypo-function on the left side. A repeat audiogram showed worsening of sensorineural hearing loss and reduction of word recognition to 90 with the right ear and 64 with the left ear Fig. 1B. Results of tympanometry were normal. The patient was referred for an urgent rheumatologic evaluation. Three days later, in the rheumatology clinic at this hospital, the patient reported ongoing hearing loss in both ears and redness in both eyes, as well as the recent onset of imbalance. He also reported that he had had fatigue and intermittent body aches for 2 months and that he had lost 5 kg of weight over a 6-month period. There was no history of oral or genital lesions; 6 weeks earlier, a nonpruritic patchy rash had developed on his torso after he received the influenza vaccine and had rapidly resolved with the use of an oral antihistamine. There was a history of irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulosis, gastritis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. Medications included intranasal and inhaled fluticasone, vita-min B12, and omeprazole. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with his wife in an urban area of New England. For the past 12 years, he had been sexually active with his wife only. He was a retired construction worker. He was a nonsmoker, drank alcohol rarely, and did not use illicit drugs. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 36.9C, the blood pressure 115/79 mm Hg, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while he was breathing ambient air. There was redness in both eyes. The finger-rub test revealed grossly reduced hearing in both ears. The Romberg test was positive when the patients eyes were open, a finding that indicates vestibular or cerebellar hypofunction. The remainder of the examination, including skin, joint, and neurologic assessments, was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The complete blood count with differential count was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 55 mm per hour reference range, 0 to 13, and the C-reactive protein level 12.3 mg per liter reference value, 8.0. The patient was referred for an urgent ophthalmologic evaluation at this hospital, which was to take place on the same day. On ophthalmologic evaluation, the patient reported no blurred vision, floaters, eye pain, itching, or photophobia. He wore contact lenses, which he changed daily. On examination, visual acuity was normal in both eyes. The right cornea had trace pinpoint epithelial deposits, a peripheral ring of punctate epithelial erosions, and several small confluent areas of punctate epithelial erosions centrally, with no infiltrate. The left cornea had a peripheral ring of punctate epithelial erosions and several confluent areas of punctate epithelial erosions centrally, with no infiltrate. There was evidence of anterior uveitis, with 7 cells per high-power field in the right anterior chamber and 6 to 7 cells per high-power field in the left anterior chamber.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: CME Dr. Marina Avetisyan Neurology, Brigham and Womens Hospital: A 65-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of rapidly progressive weakness in the right arm and recurrent falls. Twelve years before this admission, the patient noted worsening gait and balance disturbance, which slowly progressed, and falls began to occur 5 years before this admission. Her medical history included measles encephalitis, which had been diagnosed when she was 6 years of age and had resulted in weakness on the left side, severe vision and hearing impairment, and gait and balance disturbance. After rehabilitation therapy, her balance and gait apparently normalized, but she had mild residual weakness on the left side, which resulted in a change from left-hand to right-hand dominance. Two years before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital. She reported difficulties with balance, which worsened with head turning. She reported no disequilibrium, vertigo, back pain, paresthesia, or numbness. On examination, her cognitive function was intact, and although her speech was dysarthric and hypophonic, these abnormalities could have been associated with her hearing loss. The cranial-nerve examination revealed abnormal eye movements, with square-wave jerks, saccadic pursuit, and bilateral horizontal nystagmus. The hearing and vision were severely reduced. The muscle bulk was decreased throughout, and tone was normal. Motor strength was full and symmetric in the arms and legs bilaterally, and contractures were present in the fingers of the left hand. Reflexes were reduced or absent throughout, and plantar reflexes were extensor bilaterally. Vibratory sensation was reduced at the great toes but was otherwise normal. The patient had appendicular dysmetria on both finger-to-nose testing and heel-to-shin testing that was greater on the left side than on the right side. Her gait was wide-based, and she was unable to walk with a tandem gait. The Romberg sign was present. Needle electromyographic findings and the results of nerve-conduction studies were normal, as were findings on magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material. MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine revealed mild multilevel degenerative disk disease without clinically significant spinal-canal steno-sis. A lumbar puncture was performed; analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid CSF showed 0 nucleated cells per microliter reference range, 0 to 5, and oligoclonal bands were absent. Tests of the CSF and serum for antibodies associated with autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalitis were negative Table 1. The patient underwent physical therapy, and her symptoms stabilized. Three months before this admission, weakness in the right hand and right arm developed. The patient initially attributed the weakness to fatigue, since it had occurred during a time of increased physical activity associated with moving to a different apartment. However, the weakness did not abate, and 2 months before this admission, she was again evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital. She noted difficulty with communicating in sign language and with holding objects in her right hand because of weakness and had started using her left hand to eat. She reported no neck, arm, or leg pain and no sensory loss. Her gait and balance were stable, with no recent falls. On examination, there was reduced facial expression and reduced muscle bulk and tone throughout. The right shoulder was dropped, with weakness in the right trapezius and reduced active shoulder abduction that was limited to 70 degrees, without pain on shoulder abduction. There was predominantly proximal weakness in the right arm; the muscle strength was 45 on shoulder abduction and external rotation, 45 on elbow flexion, and 45 on elbow extension, wrist extension, and abductor digiti minimi and finger extension. The strength in the right leg was normal. There was subtle weakness on the left side that involved wrist and finger extension and great toe extension. Deep-tendon reflexes were 2 at the right biceps and 1 at the left biceps and were otherwise areflexic throughout. Sensation was intact in the arms, but there was decreased vibratory sensation and proprioception at the great toes; sensation was otherwise normal. Moderate appendicular dys-metria was present in the arms and legs. The patients gait, which was assessed while she was using her white cane the type of cane commonly used by blind or visually impaired persons, was wide-based; she took excessively large steps and reached out once to touch the wall. Neurologic examination was otherwise unchanged from the examination performed 2 years earlier. Additional studies were obtained. Dr. Pamela W. Schaefer: MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was reported to be normal. MRI of the cervical spine was also performed without the administration of contrast material; T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR imaging showed signal hyperintensity in the suboccipital and paraspinal soft tissues that was consistent with edema. Areas of intrinsic hyperintense signal that were consistent with fatty atrophy were seen on T1-weighted imaging. There were diffuse degenerative changes with mild spinal-canal stenosis at C4C5, without cord compression. Dr. Avetisyan: Repeat needle electromyography revealed no recorded motor units in the right deltoid or infraspinatus muscles, with complex repetitive discharges in the right cervical para-spinal and deltoid muscles. Nerve-conduction studies revealed mild reduction in the amplitudes of the bilateral median and right ulnar sensory responses; the sensory responses of the right radial, bilateral antebrachial cutaneous, and bilateral medial antebrachial cutaneous nerves were normal, as were the motor responses of the right median and right ulnar nerves. During the ensuing 2 months, the weakness in the right arm progressed rapidly, which caused the patient to have difficulty ambulating with her white cane she was unable to walk with a standard cane, making walking unsafe after frequent falls and rendering her practically bedbound. She had no pain or numbness in her arm. She was ultimately unable to care for herself at home and was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation. Other medical history included hypercholes-terolemia and hypothyroidism. Medications included ascorbic acid, vitamin B complex, coen-zyme Q10, vitamin E, calcium carbonate and cholecalciferol, and levothyroxine. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone and worked for a nonprofit agency. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank four glasses of wine per week, and did not use illicit drugs. She reported that her father had died from Creutzfeldt Jakob disease when he was 71 years of age, 7 months after the onset of symptoms. Her mother had Alzheimers disease, which was diagnosed when she was in her 60s; she was currently living in a nursing home. The patient had four siblings; one had died at 46 years of age from an intracerebral hemorrhage, and her remaining three siblings were well. On examination, the temperature was 35.7C, the blood pressure 116/64 mm Hg, the pulse 61 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 15.8. The patient appeared emaciated but was able to sit up in a chair and hold her head up. Strength in her right arm had decreased to 25 on shoulder shrug, shoulder abduction, elbow flex-ion, and elbow extension, with 35 strength on wrist extension and finger flexion and extension. There was new proximal weakness in the right leg, with 45 strength on right hip flexion. The strength in the left arm was unchanged. Deep-tendon reflexes were 3 at the right biceps and 2 at the brachioradialis and were otherwise absent throughout. She had ataxia as well as occasional jerks that involved the legs with the left leg affected to a greater extent than the right leg and were possibly stimulus-induced. The remainder of the neurologic examination was unchanged from the last visit. Dr. Schaefer: MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a new linear signal on susceptibility-weighted imaging but also a marked decrease in subtle restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging and hyperintensity on FLAIR imaging identified in retrospect on the previous MRI in the left frontal and left parietal lobes Fig. 1. MRI of the whole spine, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was unchanged from previous imaging. Dr. Avetisyan: The creatine kinase level was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Genetic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. ", "prediction": "1. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS): The rapidly progressive weakness and fasciculations, combined with EMG findings of no motor units, suggest a classic presentation of ALS.\n2.

Myasthenia Gravis: The progressive weakness without pain and normal sensation, together with fluctuating symptoms and the fatigue-related initial presentation, might point toward myasthenia gravis.\n4. Spinal Cord Compression: Although imaging showed no significant stenosis, the findings and symptom progression necessitate considering a reversible compressive myelopathy.\n5. Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP): The long-standing progressive weakness, ataxia, and EMG findings might be indicative of CIDP, an immune-mediated neuropathy.\n6.

Paraneoplastic Syndrome: Given the patient’s history and progressive neurological symptoms without another clear cause, a paraneoplastic syndrome linked to an underlying malignancy should be considered.\n8. Cervical Radiculopathy: The weakness localized to the right arm with corresponding EMG abnormalities could be due to a nerve root compression or irritation at C4-C5 level.\n9. Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis: The patient's long-standing ataxia, dysarthria, hypophonia, and recent progression of muscle weakness meet some clinical criteria for primary progressive multiple sclerosis.\n10.

Six years before the current evaluation, the patient received a diagnosis of superficial spreading melanoma of the left shoulder. He was treated with a wide local excision; a biopsy of the sentinel lymph node was negative for melanoma. One year before the current evaluation, the patient began to have slurred speech and weakness in the left hand. Imaging revealed a mass lesion in the parietal lobe of the brain and another mass in the hilum of the left lung. Craniotomy with resection of the brain mass was performed; pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed findings consistent with melanoma, as did a biopsy of the lung mass. Seizures developed postoperatively, and treatment with levetiracetam was initiated. Further treatment included radiation therapy targeting the parietal resection cavity and the administration of pembrolizumab. Four months before the current evaluation, after seven cycles of pembrolizu-mab, the blood thyrotropin level was 9.4 IU per milliliter reference range, 0.4 to 5.0 and the free thyroxine level 0.9 ng per deciliter 12 pmol per liter; reference range, 0.9 to 1.8 ng per deciliter 12 to 23 pmol per liter; treatment with levothy-roxine was initiated. Three months before the current evaluation, after eight cycles of pembrolizumab, exertional angina developed, and the patient underwent coronary catheterization with placement of two drug-eluting stents. Pembrolizumab treatment was resumed 1 month later. When the patient presented to the oncology clinic for a planned infusion of pembrolizumab, he reported a 3-week history of fatigue and a 2-week history of increased thirst and nocturia, with a need to urinate as many as three times each night. Although there was no change in appetite or eating habits, he had lost 5 kg of weight in the previous 3 weeks. There was no headache or change in vision. On examination, the temperature was 36.4C, the heart rate 75 beats per minute, the blood pressure 128/66 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The CME at NEJM.org body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 29.0. Heart sounds were regular, with no murmur. Lung sounds were normal. There was no leg edema. Muscle bulk was normal, as was strength in the arms and legs. There was no rash, bruising, or change in skin tone. Other history included hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease. Medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, levetiracetam, levothyroxine, metoprolol, and pembrolizumab. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. The patient lived in New England and was a retired police officer. His father, sister, and brother had had melanoma. There was no family history of diabetes. A complete blood count, the results of liver-function tests, and the blood thyrotropin level were normal. The blood glucose level was 505 mg per deciliter 28.03 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter 3.89 to 6.11 mmol per liter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Diana L. Stern Psychiatry: A 65-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of depression, recurrent falls, and difficulty caring for herself. Four years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of depression that was precipitated by psychosocial stressors. She was treated with bupropion, citalopram, and cognitive behavioral therapy. The depression was well controlled until 1 year before the current admission, when she began to have an-hedonia, decreased energy, sadness, and poor concentration. She resumed cognitive behavioral therapy, but her symptoms worsened during the next 4 months, and she had suicidal ideation. The dose of bupropion was increased, and treatment with trazodone was started. Fourteen weeks before the current admission, the patient was in a motor vehicle accident that was attributed to her falling asleep while driving. After the accident, she reported increased sadness, low energy, and inability to perform her usual activities. One week later, she fell and struck her head, and she was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. She reported that, before her fall, she had been feeling unsteady because of weakness in the left leg. A physical examination was normal. Computed tomography CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed hypodensi-ties involving the subcortical and periventricular white matter, findings consistent with chronic small-vessel disease. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital and was discharged home. During the next week, the patient had balance difficulties and began using a walker. When she was evaluated in the neurology clinic, she reported imbalance and occasional nausea. On examination, she had a depressed affect. Strength was assessed as 55 in the proximal and distal muscles of the arms and legs. Reflexes were 1 and symmetric at the biceps, triceps, and patellar tendons and were CME at NEJM.org absent at the ankles, with downgoing toes. The gait was wide-based and unsteady, with mild dragging of the left leg. A diagnosis of post-concussive syndrome was considered, and treatment with ondansetron was started for nausea. Additional tests were performed. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed increased signal intensity in the pons and in a periventricu-lar distribution on T2-weighted imaging, without associated contrast enhancement. There was a region of decreased signal intensity in the right corona radiata on a map of the apparent diffusion coefficient. Results of electroencephalography were normal, as were results of electromyography and nerve-conduction studies of the left leg. Physical therapy was recommended, and repeat MRI was planned for 6 weeks later. Over the next 6-week period, during sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, the patient was noted to be less talkative, with slow processing, impaired recall, and mild inattention. Repeat MRI with angiography performed 6 weeks after the first study revealed patchy hyperintensity involving the centrum semiovale, corona radiata, internal capsule, and corticospinal tract bilaterally on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR imaging, without contrast enhancement; the cerebral vasculature was normal. The patient had recurrent falls without loss of consciousness and began using a wheelchair. She reported worsening sadness, anxiety, and anhedonia, and treatment with buspirone was started. On evaluation in the neurology clinic 6 weeks before the current admission, testing of leg strength yielded inconsistent results, but strength in both legs was assessed as 55 with maximum effort. Dragging of the left leg was also noted to be inconsistent. There were concerns that her depression might be contributing to her neurologic changes, and further follow-up with the psychiatric service was recommended. Five weeks before the current admission, the patients husband brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for an evaluation of worsening memory impairment, poor self-care, and frequent falls. The patient had stopped participating in physical therapy and was spending most of the day in bed. She reported that she had lost 14 kg during the previous 4 months. Other medical history included hypertension, diabetes, and osteoarthritis of the knees. There was a history of postpartum depression 27 years earlier that had lasted for several months. Medications included amlodipine, buspirone, bupro-pion, cholecalciferol, citalopram, metformin, and trazodone. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her husband in a suburb of Boston and worked as a teacher. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol only occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had a history of anxiety and depression in her seventh decade of life. Her sister had a history of stroke. On examination, the patient appeared tired and disheveled, with psychomotor retardation. Strength in both legs was assessed as 55. She had a monoplegic gait, with buckling of the left leg, when walking down a hallway, but she had a normal gait when walking on a treadmill. Her score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 25, indicating mild cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function. The complete blood count, results of liver-function and kidney-function tests, and blood levels of cobalamin, thyrotropin, and electrolytes were normal. Screening for syphilis, Lyme disease, and the human immunodeficiency virus was negative, as was urine toxicologic screening. After an evaluation by a neurology consultant, the patient was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit. While the patient was in the hospital, the dose of citalopram was tapered, and treatment with desvenlafaxine and amphetaminedextro-amphetamine was started; her levels of attention and wakefulness increased. She participated in group psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and occupational and physical therapy. She continued to have variable weakness in the left leg and had three witnessed falls, during which she reportedly had fatigue and lowered herself to the ground. On hospital day 11, the patient reported being unable to use her left arm because of weakness. Although her left arm rested across her chest for most of the day, she was observed holding her husbands hand with her left hand when saying goodbye. On evaluation by a neurology consultant, strength in the left arm was assessed as 55. The working diagnosis was functional neurologic disorder. On hospital day 12, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center. At the rehabilitation center, the patient received physical, occupational, and speech therapy, as well as medications to treat depression. During the first week, she made progress toward independence in bathing, toileting, and grooming but had limited attention, memory, and problem solving. During the second week, she became more withdrawn. There was a paucity of speech with hypophonia, decreased attention, and less eye contact with visitors who sat on her left side than with visitors who sat on her right side. During the third week, the patient stopped answering questions and following commands. She was evaluated again in the emergency department of this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.7C, the blood pressure 141/90 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was withdrawn and minimally interactive. She was able to state her name but not the date or location. She did not blink in response to threat on the left side and did not track the examiners finger past the midline to the left. There was flattening of the left nasolabial fold. The left arm was hypertonic and held in flexion; there was no spontaneous movement of the left arm or leg, and she declined to participate in a strength examination. She did not withdraw the left arm in response to nail-bed pressure; she withdrew the left foot with antigravity movement in response to tactile stimulation. The white-cell count was 12,940 per micro-liter reference range, 4500 to 11,000, with a normal differential count. The remainder of the complete blood count was normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests and blood levels of electrolytes. A diagnostic test was performed.

Parkinson's disease: The patient's balance difficulties, hypophonia, hypomimia (less eye contact), and cognitive impairment may be indicative of Parkinson's disease, although lack of tremor and rigidity makes this less likely.\n6. Multiple sclerosis: Bilateral involvement in the corticospinal tract and other findings on MRI suggest the possibility of multiple sclerosis, especially with fluctuating neurologic deficits.\n7. Normal pressure hydrocephalus: The combination of cognitive decline, gait disturbance (wide-based and unsteady gait), and urinary incontinence could suggest normal pressure hydrocephalus, although imaging findings would need further evaluation.\n8. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy: The patient’s history of a motor vehicle accident and subsequent head trauma could contribute to her progressive cognitive and mood disturbances.\n9. Mitochondrial disease: Given her chronic progressive symptoms, both psychiatric and neurological, and her family history, a mitochondrial disorder could be considered.\n10. Lyme disease-associated neuroborreliosis: Although she tested negative for Lyme disease, the geographic location and mix of cognitive and motor symptoms still make this a consideration given the variability and potential false negatives in serology testing."}

Phadke: A 54-year-old woman with a history of episodic swelling of the arms, hands, and feet was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Twenty-three years before the current presentation, swelling of the left hand developed after the patient sustained a human bite. The swelling was associated with mild pruritus, erythema, and warmth. The swelling was well demarcated, involved only the left hand, and resolved after 3 days without specific treatment. Twenty-two years before the current presentation, the patient had epigastric pain that radiated to her back, with associated nausea. Results of an upper gastrointestinal series, computed tomography CT of the abdomen, hepatobiliary scintig-raphy, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy were reportedly normal. The abdominal pain resolved, but two similar self-limited episodes occurred during the next year. No cause for the abdominal pain was identified. During the next 3 years, episodes of self-limited swelling occurred once per year; one episode involved the right foot, one the left hand, and one the right hand. There were no clear triggers for the episodes, although they tended to occur after exposure to cold or after minor trauma, such as scratching. Eighteen years before the current presentation, episodes of swelling of the hands and feet began to occur on a monthly basis, and the patient was evaluated at another hospital after an episode of swelling of the left hand. A skin-biopsy specimen reportedly showed sparse superficial dermal perivascular and interstitial mixed inflammatory infiltrate and stromal edema. Treatment with prednisone was initiated. The swelling of the left hand resolved after 3 days, and the patient was referred to the allergy clinic of this hospital. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnosis of acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency was made on the basis of low levels of C1 esterase inhibitor, C4, and C1q. Results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal, and tests for antinuclear antibodies were negative. The patient was evaluated in the allergy clinic of a third hospital, and treatment with CME at NEJM.org daily danazol was initiated. The episodes of swelling of the hands and feet resolved. Ten years before the current presentation, episodes of swelling of the eyelids and upper lip occurred with associated pruritus. The episodes began with a sensation of facial flushing, pruri-tus of the scalp, and a raised pruritic rash on the face and chest; at times, these episodes were accompanied by shortness of breath, chest tightness, itchy throat, and red eyes. The patient was evaluated in the allergy clinic of the third hospital. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The dose of danazol was increased, and the patient was instructed to take hydroxyzine as needed during episodes of swelling that were associated with pruritus. The swelling episodes associated with pruritus occurred with variable frequency several times per week to once every few months but resolved within 30 minutes after the administration of hydroxyzine. Cetirizine was substituted for hydroxyzine for acute episodes. Treatment with daily loratadine and ranitidine was initiated, and the episodes of swelling with pruritus decreased in frequency. Four months before the current presentation, swelling of the right arm developed after veni-puncture. There was no associated pruritus. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. Ultrasonography of the arm showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombo-sis, and the patient was discharged from the emergency department. The swelling resolved after 3 days. Two weeks before the current presentation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea developed. The patient attributed her symptoms to food poisoning, since her daughter had similar symptoms; the symptoms resolved after 3 days. One week before the current presentation, epigastric pain developed; the pain was burning in character, worsened with consumption of food, and abated with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs. The patient was evaluated at a fourth hospital, where CT of the abdomen reportedly revealed inflammation of the duodenum and jejunum. A proton-pump inhibitor was administered, and the abdominal pain decreased. The patient was instructed not to take NSAIDs and was discharged home. However, during the next week, abdominal pain recurred, along with new symptoms of poor appetite and early satiety. She presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further care. Other history included hypertension, low-back pain, and osteoporosis; she had undergone previous appendectomy and cesarean section. The patient also had a subepithelial duodenal mass, measuring 7 mm in diameter, that had been stable in size during the past 5 years; ultrasono-graphic images had shown that the mass was consistent with a benign stromal cell neoplasm. Medications included amlodipine, calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, omeprazole, ranitidine, loratadine, and danazol, as well as cetirizine as needed. The patient had no known medication allergies but was allergic to iodinated contrast material. She was originally from Bangladesh and now lived with her husband and two children in a suburban community in New England and worked as a teacher. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension. The patient reported no similar episodes of swelling in either of her parents. On examination, the temperature was 36.8C, the blood pressure 106/81 mm Hg, the pulse 74 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was mildly distended with normal bowel sounds and diffuse tenderness on palpation, without rebound or involuntary guarding. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The complete blood count was normal, as were blood levels of lipase, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, troponin, and thyrotropin. The alanine aminotransferase level was 49 IU per liter reference range, 7 to 33, and the aspartate aminotransferase level was 52 IU per liter reference range, 9 to 32. Dr. Ravi Gottumukkala: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of oral or intravenous contrast material, revealed long-segment marked circumferential thickening of the jejunal wall with associated mesen-teric edema and small-volume free intraperito-neal fluid.

Castle: A 56-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital in the spring of 2020, during the initial surge of the coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19 pandemic in Boston, because of fever, myalgias, diarrhea, and a dry cough. Six weeks before this admission, the patient had contact with a person with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 infection. At that time, she did not have any symptoms compatible with Covid-19 and was not tested for SARS-CoV-2. Four weeks before this admission, in accordance with statewide recommendations from the Department of Public Health, the patient began isolating at home with her teenage son, working from home, and having groceries delivered. Two weeks before this admission, she and her son left home for a few hours to eat outdoors and spend time in a wooded area; they otherwise remained at home. Six days before this admission, fever, chills, and myalgias developed. The next day, watery diarrhea occurred. The patients temperature measured at home was 38.3C; fever persisted despite the intermittent administration of acetaminophen. Three days before this admission, a frontal headache developed, along with a dry cough that was associated with a self-limited episode of chest pain. The patients son had had no symptoms, except for a self-limited episode of diarrhea 2 weeks before the patients symptoms developed. On the day of admission, the patient continued to have fever, so she presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing myalgias, headache, and cough. There was no nausea, vomiting, rash, shortness of breath, or anosmia. She had no notable medical history and took no medications. She was allergic to amoxicillin, with an unknown reaction. She did not smoke tobacco and drank alcohol rarely; she did not use illicit drugs. The patient lived in an urban area of New England and had traveled to Canada 6 months before this admission. She had a pet cat; there was no other animal contact. On examination, the patient appeared anxious, but breathing was unlabored. The temperature was 38.9C, the blood pressure 121/64 mm Hg, the heart rate 124 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95 at rest and 98 during ambulation, both while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and oriented to time, place, and person. There were no focal neurologic deficits. There was no meningism. The mucous membranes were dry. The first and second heart sounds were normal, without additional sounds or murmurs. There were vesicular breath sounds. The abdomen was soft and nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly. There was no rash. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Patrick P. Bourgouin: Chest radiography revealed low lung volumes, without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Dr. Castle: SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal specimen was negative, as was testing for adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1 through 4, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus and enterovirus, Bordetella pertussis, B. parapertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Blood cultures were negative. Urinalysis was negative for leukocyte esterase and nitrites. The procalcitonin level was 0.36 ng per milliliter reference range, 0.00 to 0.08. Intravenous fluids and acetaminophen were administered, and the heart rate decreased to 93 beats per minute. The patient was admitted to this hospital because of concerns that she had Covid-19. On the second hospital day, the patient had ongoing diarrhea, headache, and cough, along with fatigue. The temperature was 40.2C, the blood pressure 115/64 mm Hg, the heart rate 89 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while she was breathing ambient air. The administration of intravenous fluids was continued. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing of a second nasopharyngeal specimen was negative. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. On the third hospital day, the temperature was 38.7C. Dr. Bourgouin: Computed tomography CT of the chest, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed interlobular septal thickening, mild ground-glass opacities at the lung bases, and small bilateral pleural effusions Fig. 1. Dr. Castle: During the next 3 days, the patient had ongoing myalgias, headache, and cough. Fever persisted, and the oxygen saturation remained normal. Urine antigen testing for legion-ella and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens was negative, as was screening for human immunodeficiency virus HIV types 1 and 2 and nucleic acid testing of a blood specimen for cytomega-lovirus and EpsteinBarr virus. Blood cultures remained negative. On the seventh hospital day, diarrhea resolved, but fever, myalgias, headache, and cough persisted. The physical examination was unchanged, with a normal oxygen saturation during ambulation. Dr. Bourgouin: Chest radiography revealed no evidence of pneumonia. Dr. Castle: The procalcitonin level was 0.57 ng per milliliter; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Levofloxacin was administered.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: CME at NEJM.org Dr. David M. Dudzinski: A 78-year-old man was evaluated in the cardiology clinic of this hospital because of biventricular myocardial wall thickening, progressive mi-tral regurgitation, and ventricular arrhythmias. The patient had been a distinguished multisport athlete in high school and college. However, in his 20s, he found that he was unable to perform competitively, and he noticed that he did not sweat as much as his teammates. After an episode of sports-related exertional dizziness, he was evaluated by a physician, and a diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was considered. Twenty-five years before the current evaluation, a transthoracic echocardiogram TTE reportedly showed a symmetric left ventricular wall thickness of 19 mm reference value, 11, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 74 reference range, 50 to 75, mitral valve thickening, and trace mitral regurgitation, with no left ventricular outflow gradient. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, incomplete right bundle-branch block, precordial J-point elevation, and QRS voltage that met the electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy Fig. 1A. The patients blood pressure was 160/90 mm Hg, and he started treatment with meto-prolol succinate and then also with amlodipine for elevated blood pressure. During the next 10 years, the patient had intermittent chest discomfort, exer-tional dyspnea, and leg edema. The chest discomfort and exertional dyspnea were most likely to occur when he was walking or after he had eaten a meal. He was evaluated by three cardiologists; treatment with metoprolol succinate and amlo-dipine was continued, treatment with enalapril was started, and triamterene hydrochlorothiazide was administered as needed for leg edema. A repeat TTE reportedly showed a symmetric left ventricular wall thickness of 20 mm, a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, right ventricular wall thickening, left atrial enlargement, mitral valve thickening, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, aortic valve thickening, and mild ascending aortic dilatation 39 mm, with no evidence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and no evidence of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. An exercise stress test followed by imaging performed with the use of sestamibi (known as a sestamibi stress test) revealed left ventricular wall thickening, with no perfusion defects. Coronary angiography revealed evidence of chronic total occlusion of the distal left anterior descending artery, with collateral flow from both the left and right coronary arteries. Left ventriculography revealed hyperdynamic left ventricular function and 2+ mitral regurgitation (see Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 28 mm Hg (reference range, 5 to 10), with no left ventricular intracavitary gradient, including during ventricular ectopic beats and during the Valsalva maneuver, and with no evidence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The blood pressure remained well controlled while the patient was taking metoprolol, amlodipine, and enalapril. Nine years before the current evaluation, the patient had complete heart block with symptomatic bradycardia (Figure 1B), with associated nausea, dizziness, and chest discomfort. A temporary transvenous pacing wire was placed; the results of coronary angiography performed at that time were unchanged from the previous study. The creatinine level was 1.2 mg per deciliter (106 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 μmol per liter]); the blood levels of electrolytes and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis. A dual-chamber implantable cardioverter–defibrillator (ICD) was placed. Four months later, atrial fibrillation developed. Cardioversion was performed with guidance by transesophageal echocardiography, resulting in sinus rhythm. However, atrial fibrillation recurred after 3 days. Treatment with amiodarone and warfarin was begun. During the next 5 years, recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were detected on ICD interrogation. A repeat TTE showed a left ventricular wall thickness of 23 mm and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. Four years before the current evaluation, during a holiday trip, the patient was hospitalized in another state because of pulmonary edema that developed after he had consumed food that was high in sodium. He was treated with intravenous furosemide and discharged with a prescription for oral furosemide. Findings on TTE were reportedly similar to those observed previously. Treatment with amlodipine was stopped because of lightheadedness. At follow-up appointments during the next 4 years, the patient reported fatigue and exertional dyspnea that occurred after he had climbed one flight of stairs or when he was walking on an incline. In addition, he had nocturia once per night, slept on two pillows, and had intermittent wheezing, including episodes that awakened him from sleep. Treatment with oral furosemide (administered twice daily) was continued. Recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were detected on ICD interrogation. Approximately 3.5 years before the current evaluation, the patient sustained a fall that was unrelated to his cardiac condition. At that time, computed tomography of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, did not reveal any evidence of hemorrhage or stroke but showed periventricular and deep white-matter hypodensities. Results of pulmonary-function testing were normal. The patient presented for the current evaluation at the request of his two teenage grandsons, who wanted to know about any familial cardiac risk factors that could influence their participation in sports. A review of systems was notable for intermittent palpitations, chronic dry eyes, reduced hearing, tinnitus in both ears (greater in the right ear than in the left ear), restless legs, and constipation. The patient reported no headache, paresthesia, stroke symptoms, diarrhea, skin changes, or intolerance to heat or cold. His medical history included cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, atrioventricular block and atrial fibrillation, dyslipidemia, hypertension, progressive renal insufficiency, cataracts, and prostatic hypertrophy with carcinoma in situ. Medications included furosemide, warfarin, amiodarone, aspirin, atorvastatin, metoprolol, enalapril, and tamsulosin, as well as inhaled fluticasone. Amiodarone had caused thyroiditis, which had been treated with a course of prednisone; there were no other known adverse reactions to medication. The patient was a retired executive and lived with his spouse in Massachusetts. His family history was notable for brain cancer in his father, obstructive lung disease and lung cancer in his mother, and lung cancer in his sister, who had died from the disease. There was also a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in his sister and in a niece. His family was of Mediterranean origin; information about other relatives was limited. His son and grandsons were healthy, and his son had reportedly had normal results on an electrocardiogram and echocardiograms. The patient did not drink alcohol and had never used tobacco. On examination, the heart rate was 79 beats per minute and the blood pressure 106//60 mm Hg. The weight was 89 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 26.6. There was a left ventricular heave. Auscultation revealed splitting of the S2 heart sound, a grade 3/6 systolic murmur that could be heard throughout the precordium and did not change during the Valsalva maneuver, and a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex that radiated to the axilla; there was no S3 heart sound. There was trace leg edema and mild chronic venous stasis. The rest of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results were notable for a creatinine level of 1.5 mg per deciliter (133 μmol per liter), a urea nitrogen level of 39 mg per deciliter (13.9 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter]), an international normalized ratio of 2.1 (reference range, 0.9 to 1.1), and an N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide level of 2523 pg per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 1800), as well as 1+ protein on urinalysis. The blood levels of iron, glycated hemoglobin, thyrotropin, and free thyroxine were normal, and a test for antinuclear antibodies was negative. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing. A TTE was obtained, and additional diagnostic tests were performed.

The symptoms resolved after 4 days without specific intervention, but then intermittent dysphagia with solid foods and early satiety developed. During the next 4 weeks, the patient had gradually progressive fatigue and light-headedness. The fatigue progressed to the point that she could no longer stay at work for more than a few hours; she presented to another hospital for evaluation. At the other hospital, the patient reported that she had ongoing fatigue and had lost 6 kg of weight over a 5-week period. On examination, the temperature was 38.9C, the weight 55.5 kg, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 21.9. Laboratory studies revealed pancytopenia, and examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed schistocytes. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Ranjodh S. Dhami: A chest radiograph was normal. Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed a small hiatal hernia, multiple simple cysts in the right kidney, and indeterminate bilateral pelvic masses measuring 4.8 cm in diameter on the right side and 6.3 cm in diameter on the left side Fig. 1. Dr. Pappas: Intravenous fluids were administered, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. On hospital day 2, the hemoglobin level decreased to 6.6 g per deciliter, and two units of packed red cells were transfused. Esophagogastro-duodenoscopy revealed diffuse esophageal inflammation with white exudates throughout the esophagus; examination of brushings revealed yeast consistent with candida, and treatment with fluconazole was initiated. During the next 3 hospital days, the patient continued to feel unwell, with persistent fever and limited oral intake due to odynophagia, and the administration of intravenous fluids was continued. Blood and urine cultures showed no growth. On hospital day 5, empirical therapy with doxycycline was started because of concerns about a possible tickborne illness. On hospital day 6, the oxygen saturation decreased to 89 while the patient was breathing ambient air and then increased to 94 when oxygen was delivered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening, findings consistent with pulmonary edema, along with bilateral pleural effusions of a small to moderate size. The administration of intravenous fluids was stopped, and one dose of intravenous furosemide was provided. On hospital day 7, fever resolved but pancyto-penia persisted. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed a moderate amount of schistocytes, severe anisocytosis, large platelets, and an increased amount of bands without blasts. Direct and indirect Coombs tests were negative, as were nucleic acid tests for babesiosis and anaplasmosis. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, cobalamin, folate, homocysteine, and anticardiolipin IgG and IgM were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The results of serologic tests for EpsteinBarr virus were consistent with previous infection. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood showed phenotypically normal myeloid cells; there was an increased amount of atypical CD34 myeloblasts, which accounted for less than 1 of leukocytes and were of unclear clinical significance. A tunneled catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein, and plasma exchange was initiated for the treatment of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura TTP. Total parenteral nutrition was also initiated, because oral intake was still limited by odynophagia. On hospital day 8, oral intake of soft foods and liquids increased. A transthoracic echocar-diogram showed normal left ventricular size and function, as well as a mildly thickened aortic valve with no stenosis or regurgitation; there was trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. On hospital day 9, the patient underwent additional plasma exchange and was transferred to this hospital for further care. On evaluation in this hospital, the patient reported that her energy level had increased. She recalled that she had felt mildly confused at the other hospital, but the confusion had since resolved. She had had no gum bleeding or blood in the stool or urine. Other medical history included hypertension and dyslipidemia. Surgical history included hysterectomy at 40 years of age, with no vaginal bleeding since the procedure. One year earlier, routine laboratory testing had revealed mild thrombocytopenia and anemia. A bone marrow biopsy performed at that time had revealed slightly hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis but with some erythroid abnormalities and occasional hyper-chromatic megakaryocytes; cytogenetic analysis had shown a loss of chromosomes 3 and 5 and a gain of chromosome 8 in 65 of the cells. Thereafter, blood counts monitored every 4 months, including 4 months before this presentation, had remained stable; laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Medications included amlodipine, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. There were no known drug allergies. The patient drank alcohol occasionally and did not use illicit drugs. She had smoked tobacco for 50 years but had quit 5 years before this presentation. She was widowed and lived alone in New England; her work involved cleaning a church several days a week. Her sister had had breast cancer at 30 years of age, and a brother had had testicular cancer at a young age and liver cancer at 55 years of age. On examination, the temperature was 36.8C, the blood pressure 150/65 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The patient was alert and oriented, and she did not appear ill. There were no petechiae. There was no bleeding at the site of tunneled catheter placement in the right internal jugular vein. The first and second heart sounds were normal; a grade 26 systolic murmur was heard at the left lower sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed schistocytes, anisocytosis, and a low platelet count, with large platelets present; the white cells appeared normal, and there were no blasts Fig. 2. The results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. The levels of serum free kappa and lambda light chains were increased, with a normal ratio. Screening for human immunodeficiency virus infection was negative. Urinalysis showed 2 urobilinogen, without bilirubin, blood, glucose, ketones, protein, or nitrates; the specific gravity and pH were normal. Consultation was obtained from the gyne-cology service regarding the bilateral pelvic masses noted on CT of the abdomen and pelvis. Blood levels of CA 125, CA 19-9, and carcinoem-bryonic antigen were normal, and follow-up in the gynecology clinic was recommended for further evaluation after discharge. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic test was performed, and management decisions were made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Myelodysplastic syndrome. ", "prediction": "1. Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP): The presence of schistocytes, severe anemia, and thrombocytopenia is highly suggestive of TTP, a condition characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and low platelet count.\n2. Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS): Given the patient's history of anemia, thrombocytopenia, dysplastic bone marrow findings, and chromosomal abnormalities, MDS is a likely consideration.\n3. Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS): Although primarily seen in younger individuals, the presence of schistocytes and renal involvement could point towards atypical HUS, especially with normal renal function tests.\n4. Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes: The pancytopenia and bone marrow findings could indicate a bone marrow failure syndrome such as aplastic anemia, though dysplasia would need to be ruled out.\n5. Malignancy-Related Pancytopenia: Metastatic disease involving the bone marrow can lead to pancytopenia and the observed weight loss and pelvic masses make this a consideration.\n6. Severe Vitamin B12 or Folate Deficiency: Though levels were normal, deficiencies can sometimes present with pancytopenia, neurological symptoms, and fatigue, and thus should be reconsidered or retested.\n7. Infectious Etiologies (e.g., Viral Infections like EBV or CMV): Persistent fever, organ enlargement, and pancytopenia may indicate an underlying viral infection, despite EBV serology showing past infection.\n8. Autoimmune Diseases (e.g., Lupus): Systemic autoimmune disorders like lupus can cause a wide range of symptoms, including pancytopenia, fever, and non-specific systemic complaints.\n9. Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH): The presence of schistocytes, pancytopenia, and a hemolytic component makes PNH a differential diagnosis worth considering.\n10. Hypersplenism: The pancytopenia and weight loss could potentially be secondary to hypersplenism, although this diagnosis would typically be supported by splenomegaly on imaging which hasn't been observed here."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Jacquelyn M. Nestor Medicine: A 41-year-old woman with transient dysarthria and facial droop was transferred to this hospital for evaluation of masses on the mitral valve. Three weeks before this presentation, the patient presented to the emergency department of another hospital because of concerns about heavy vaginal bleeding that had developed 1 week earlier and was associated with crampy abdominal pain, fatigue, dyspnea, and lightheadedness. Examination was notable for a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 130/79 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 100 while she was breathing ambient air; the examination was otherwise reportedly normal, although a gynecologic examination was not performed. Laboratory results were notable for a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g per deciliter reference range, 12.0 to 16.0; previous level 1 year earlier, 9.1, a mean corpuscular volume of 71.3 fl reference range, 80 to 94, and a platelet count of 148,000 per microliter reference range, 150,000 to 450,000. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable. Normal saline was administered intravenously, and a 5-day course of medroxyprogesterone acetate was prescribed. Eleven days after the patient completed the therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate 9 days before this presentation, heavy vaginal bleeding and dyspnea recurred. An additional 3-day course of medroxyprogesterone acetate was prescribed. The evening after the patient finished the second course of treatment, within 1 hour after she had been seen and had appeared to be well, her husband noted that she had facial droop on the right side and slurred speech; he called emergency medical services. When she arrived at the emergency department of a second hospital, within 1 hour after the onset of symptoms, her examination was notable for a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 173/83 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 99 while she was breathing ambient air. She was noted to have facial droop on the right side and unintelligible speech. Dr. Sandra P. Rincon: Computed tomography CT of the head Fig. 1A revealed no evidence of acute infarction or intracranial hemorrhage. Small chronic infarcts were seen in the right thalamus and right cerebellar hemisphere. A CT angiogram CTA of the head and neck did not show high-grade stenosis or large-vessel occlusion. Dr. Nestor: A neurology consultation was obtained; aspirin and atorvastatin were administered. Blood levels of electrolytes, albumin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glycated hemoglobin were normal, as were the white-cell count and differential count and the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable, and urinalysis showed 3 blood, no protein, and no casts. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Within 45 minutes after the patient arrived at the emergency department of the second hospital, the facial asymmetry and dysarthria resolved. The patient was admitted to the medical unit of the second hospital. Dr. Rincon: The next day, magnetic resonance imaging MRI and angiography of the head and neck again revealed old lacunar infarcts in the right thalamus Fig. 1B and right cerebellar hemisphere Fig. 1C. There was no evidence of an acute infarction Fig. 1D, intracranial hemorrhage, or cerebrovascular occlusion Fig. 1E and 1F. Dr. Nestor: Two units of packed red cells were transfused. Post-transfusion laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A transthoracic echocar-diogram Fig. 2A and 2B and Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org showed thickened mitral valve leaflets and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 48 mm Hg. Dr. Evin Yucel: On the third hospital day, a trans-esophageal echocardiogram Fig. 2C and Videos 2 and 3 showed multiple echodensities on the atrial side of the mitral valve leaflets at the closure lines that were consistent with vegetations. Cultures of blood were obtained, and heparin was administered intravenously. Dr. Nestor: On the fourth hospital day, the rate of heparin infusion was decreased at 6-hour intervals when the partial-thromboplastin time exceeded 150 seconds, until the infusion was stopped. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1; complement levels C3 and C4 were normal. Additional cultures of blood were obtained. Dr. Rincon: Repeat CT of the head revealed no acute abnormality. CT of the chest showed clustered nodules in the lower lobes that were probably related to aspiration, and CT of the abdomen and pelvis Fig. 2D, 2E, and 2F revealed an enlarged heterogeneous uterus with multiple fibroids. Dr. Nestor: The next day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. On a review of systems, she reported no recurrence of dysarthria or facial droop and noted no other neurologic symptoms. She reported that she had had heavy menstrual bleeding and exertional dyspnea in the weeks preceding this presentation; pruritic, macular rashes on the trunk, scalp, arms, and legs with associated photosensitivity that had persisted for many weeks; new Raynauds phenomenon in the past 10 months; and a long history of dry eyes and seasonal allergies. Medical history was notable for sickle cell trait, vitamin B12 deficiency, iron deficiency resulting in past iron infusions, uterine fibroids, anxiety, and hyperten-sion. Surgical history included multiple laparos-copies and two laparotomies, including salpingo-oophorectomy for endometriosis. Owing to infertility, she had undergone in vitro fertilization; she had a first-trimester spontaneous abortion at 25 years of age. During her second pregnancy at 33 years of age, a screening rapid plasma reagin RPR test was positive at 1:8; however, a treponemal-specific confirmatory test for syphilis was negative. Pregnancy-induced hypertension developed, followed by placental ab-ruption at 30 weeks, which resulted in a cesarean delivery. Medications included amlodipine, cyano-cobalamin, ferrous sulfate, and medroxyproges-terone acetate. She had no known medication allergies. The patient lived in eastern Massachusetts with her husband and child. She did not drink alcohol or smoke tobacco. Her mother had rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, and a history of spontaneous abortion. One grandmother had diabetes and the other grandmother had had a stroke. An aunt had had leukemia and later breast cancer. Her child has psoriasis. The temperature was 36.8C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 155/98 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 175 cm, the weight 107 kg, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 34.9. There were several small, circular macules on her back Fig. 3. There was a grade 26 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border and apex. She had no lymphadenopathy, petechiae, nail changes, or evidence of arthritis. The remainder of the examination was normal, as was a neurologic examination. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. All the blood cultures obtained at the second hospital showed no growth. An electrocardiogram was normal. Diagnostic test results were received, and management decisions were made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Systemic lupus erythematosus with antiphospho-lipid syndrome. ", "prediction": "1. Infective endocarditis: The presence of vegetations on the mitral valve leaflets and recent heavy vaginal bleeding suggest a potential source of bacteremia leading to infective endocarditis.\n2. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): The patient's pruritic, macular rashes, photosensitivity, Raynaud's phenomenon, and dry eyes are highly suggestive of SLE.\n3. Antiphospholipid syndrome: The patient's history of pregnancy-induced hypertension, placental abruption, and thrombocytopenia, combined with the presence of mitral valve masses, raise the possibility of antiphospholipid syndrome.\n4. Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE): Given the patient's history of heavy menstrual bleeding, anemia, and vegetations on the mitral valve without positive blood cultures, NBTE remains a possibility.\n5. Uterine fibroids: The patient's enlarged, heterogeneous uterus with multiple fibroids is consistent with her symptoms of heavy menstrual bleeding and crampy abdominal pain.\n6. Iron deficiency anemia: The patient's fatigue, dyspnea, and low hemoglobin levels can be attributed to iron deficiency anemia secondary to chronic blood loss from uterine fibroids.\n7. Hypertension: The patient's elevated blood pressure readings during different presentations are indicative of poorly controlled hypertension.\n8. Acute cerebrovascular event: Despite the lack of acute infarct on imaging, the transient dysarthria and facial droop warrant consideration of a transient ischemic attack or minor stroke.\n9. Sickle cell trait complications: The presence of sickle cell trait could predispose the patient to vaso-occlusive events and micro-infarcts, as seen in the thalamus and cerebellar hemispheres.\n10. Medication side effects: The repeated use of medroxyprogesterone acetate might contribute to the patient's gynecological and possibly some systemic symptoms."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Shaan Khurshid: A 56-year-old man presented to this hospital in early autumn with a 1-month history of myalgias and fever. Approximately 4 weeks before the current presentation, the patient began to have generalized myalgias and arthralgias, which were worst in the shoulders, proximal arms, and upper back. He had fever with temperatures of up to 38.2C, along with chills and diaphoresis. He took naproxen, and the next day, he presented to an urgent care clinic affiliated with this hospital. The temperature was 37.2C, the heart rate 72 beats per minute, the blood pressure 175/95 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100 while he was breathing ambient air; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. A test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative. Symptoms abated after 3 days, but then fever with temperatures of up to 38.3C and fatigue occurred. The patient stopped consuming alcohol. Three weeks later, the patient had episodes of mild dyspnea with coughing fits and presented to a second urgent care clinic affiliated with this hospital. The temperature was 37.2C, the heart rate 59 beats per minute, the blood pressure 138/75 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98 while he was breathing ambient air. He appeared fatigued, but the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Another test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative, and the results of urinalysis and chest radiography were normal. The next day, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician at another hospital. He reported a 1-month history of stabbing back pain between his shoulders, which was worst at the end of the day and was not relieved with the use of naproxen or a heating pad. The temperature was 36.7C, the heart rate 48 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/72 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100 while he was breathing ambient air. There was tenderness on palpation of the left thoracic paraspinal area, but the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Radiographic images of the thoracic spine were reportedly normal. Laboratory test results obtained at that time are shown in Table 1, alongside routine test results obtained 6 months earlier. The patient was referred to the emergency department of this hospital. On the systems review, the patient reported that he had recently measured heart rates of 40 to 50 beats per minute on his home pulse oximeter; his baseline heart rate was 80 to 90 beats per minute. He also reported a history of dysuria that was attributed to chronic prostatitis, as well as pain in the left wrist and knee that was attributed to gout. He reported no weight loss, sweats, palpitations, dyspnea, dizziness, lightheadedness, chest discomfort, joint swelling or redness, rash, headache, focal neurologic symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or rectal bleeding. The patients medical history was notable for sickle cell trait, hypertension with mild left ventricular hypertrophy, palpitations, unprovoked pulmonary embolism, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperuricemia, latent tuberculosis, malaria, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, Helicobacter pylori infection, colonic schistosomiasis, prostatism, and thrombocytopenia. His last dental procedure had taken place more than 2 years earlier. Medications included aspirin, metoprolol, and losartan, as well as sildenafil as needed. He had received two vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19, with the second vaccine administered 7 months before the current evaluation. There were no known adverse reactions to medication. The patient grew up in equatorial Central Africa. He had immigrated to the United States 20 years earlier and had not returned to Africa for more than 5 years. He was employed at a local university and occasionally had contact with college students. He lived with his family in a suburb of Boston. During the summer months, he had visited islands in Massachusetts and coastal wooded areas to hike, camp, and swim. The patient reported that he had encountered many ticks but had not received a tick bite. He had been scratched by cats; there were no other animal exposures. In the past, he had consumed two or three beers daily, but he had stopped all alcohol intake during the previous month. He had never used tobacco or illicit substances. His family history was notable for atherosclerotic coronary disease. On examination, the temperature was 36.5C, the heart rate 46 beats per minute, the blood pressure 141/65 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 34.4. He appeared comfortable. Auscultation of the chest revealed a bradycardic heart rate. There was tenderness on palpation of the left infrascapular area. A prostate examination revealed a nontender hemorrhoid. There was no rash or lymphadenopathy, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of calcium, total protein, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Electrocardiograms were notable for sinus rhythm with first-degree and second-degree 2:1 atrioventricular block with intermittent right bundle-branch block Fig. 1A, alternating with sinus rhythm with third-degree complete atrio-ventricular block and junctional escape rhythm with intraventricular conduction delay Fig. 1B. Computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was negative for pulmonary embolism. Intravenous ceftriaxone, naproxen, acetaminophen, and oxycodone were administered. The patient was evaluated by an electrophysiologist and admitted to the cardiology unit of this hospital. The next day, the heart rate remained at approximately 40 beats per minute, and the maximum temperature was 37.8C. Oxycodone and topical lidocaine were administered. Dr. Alex L. Huang: Transthoracic echocardiogra-phy TTE revealed normal biventricular systolic function, with no regional left ventricular wall-motion abnormalities. There was mild diastolic mitral and tricuspid regurgitation Fig. 1C, a finding consistent with atrioventricular block.1 There was no evidence of valvular vegetations. Dr. Khurshid: The blood level of high-sensitivity troponin was 63 ng per liter. Urinalysis was negative, as were blood tests for Lyme disease antibodies, anti-rickettsia IgM, ehrlichia and ana-plasma DNA, human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, and babesia. On the third hospital day, tests for SARS-CoV-2, Bartonella henselae and B. quintana antibodies, and anti-treponemal antibodies were negative. An interferon- release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was positive. Dr. Borek Foldyna: The patient underwent cardiac CT with electrocardiographic gating, including contrast-enhanced CT angiography and delayed imaging. Epicardial fat and a thickened interatrial septum abutting the noncoronary sinus of the aortic valve showed increased radioden-sity on delayed imaging Fig. 2A and 2B; these findings are suggestive of inflammatory changes and may indicate evolving abscess. The tricus-pid aortic valve had mildly thickened leaflets, but there was no evidence of focal valvular vegetations, thrombi, or calcifications. Dr. Khurshid: Oral doxycycline was administered. On the fourth hospital day, the ventricular rate measured between 30 and 40 beats per minute, and the maximum temperature was 37.9C.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Regional myocarditis due to infection with Liste-ria monocytogenes.

Uchida Medicine: A 57-year-old man was evaluated in the gastroen-terology clinic of this hospital because of new ascites. Twenty years before the current presentation, the patient began to have swelling of the legs, which initially occurred only after airplane trips. During the fifth decade of life, the leg swelling was present on a daily basis. Thirteen years before the current presentation, the patient began to have frequent bowel movements up to four per day with loose malodorous stools and increased flatus. He was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. On examination, the abdomen was soft and nontender, with no evidence of organomegaly. There was pitting edema in both legs. The blood level of total protein was 5.5 g per deciliter reference range, 6.0 to 8.3, and the blood albumin level was 3.1 g per deciliter reference range, 3.3 to 5.0. Results of other liver-function tests, including liver enzyme levels, were normal. The protein level in a 24-hour urine sample was normal. The blood alpha1-antitrypsin level was 173 mg per deciliter reference value, 54. Blood levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM were low. Serologic tests for antitissue trans-glutaminase antibodies and anti-giardia antibodies were negative. Dr. Mark A. Anderson: Computed tomographic CT enterography of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed diffuse mural thickening and hyperenhancement of the small bowel, with no evidence of stricturing or obstruction Fig. 1A and 1B. In addition, there was trace ascites Fig. 1B. Dr. Uchida: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy EGD and colonoscopy revealed no visible abnormalities. A random biopsy specimen of the duodenum showed a focal area with more than 70 eosinophils per high-power field; a biopsy specimen of the gastric antrum showed scattered eosinophils in the lamina propria. A working diagnosis of protein-losing enteropathy was made, although neither a 2-week course of oral prednisone nor a 6-week course of oral budesonide led to a decrease in the number of bowel movements or leg edema. No further treatment was pursued. Eleven years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. There had been no weight loss or recurrent infections, but leg edema persisted. Repeat EGD revealed no visible abnormalities, and a random biopsy specimen of the duodenum showed fewer eosinophils than the previous specimen, with no epithelial damage. CT enterography revealed diffuse wall thickening of the entire small bowel and trace ascites. Treatment for protein-losing enteropathy  which included limiting salt intake, increasing dietary protein, and wearing compression stockings  was recommended. During the next 10 years, the leg edema was stable and was occasionally treated with diuretic agents, which did not lead to substantial improvement. Six months before the current presentation, the patient began to have dyspnea on exertion. Three months before this presentation, abdominal distention developed. The patient initially attributed the dyspnea and abdominal distention to weight gain due to reduced physical activity during quarantine for the coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19 pandemic. Six weeks before this presentation, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician in a video conference. On the basis of this evaluation, laboratory and imaging studies were obtained. The blood level of total protein was 4.5 g per deciliter updated reference range, 6.4 to 8.3, and the blood albumin level was 2.1 g per deciliter. The complete blood count, blood levels of electrolytes and glucose, and results of liver-function and kidney-function tests were normal. Dr. Anderson: CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple small pulmonary nodules, enlarged subcarinal and upper mesenteric lymph nodes, and moderate-volume ascites in the upper abdomen. Dr. Uchida: Three weeks later, paracentesis was performed, and 3.1 liters of milky-appearing ascitic fluid were removed. Results of the ascitic fluid analysis are shown in Table 1. Cytologic examination of the ascitic fluid revealed no malignant cells. The patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation. On the current presentation, the patient reported that he was having bowel movements with normally formed stools and no abdominal pain. His wife had noticed that he appeared to be moving slowly when performing activities of daily living and that he had lost muscle mass in his arms. There was no history of abdominal surgery or trauma to the abdomen. Other medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, psoriasis, osteoarthritis, and hypogammaglobu-linemia. There was no history of recurrent infections, asthma, or atopic dermatitis. Medications included aspirin, insulin glargine, and metfor-min. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with his wife in a suburb of Boston and worked in an office. He was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. His mother had colon cancer. The physical examination was limited, because the evaluation was done in a video conference in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Anderson: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed multiple new hypoenhancing lesions throughout the right and left hepatic lobes, diffuse small-bowel wall thickening, moderate-volume ascites, upper abdominal varices, and enlarged upper abdominal and pelvic nodes Fig. 1C, 1D, and 1E. The only liver lesions that were large enough for reliable percutaneous sampling were at the far cranial aspect of the hepatic dome, where respiratory motion and crossing the diaphragm would have made an attempt at CT-guided or ultrasono-graphically guided biopsy very challenging, if not prohibitive. CT of the chest revealed tree-in-bud and clustered nodules, predominantly in the dependent lower lobes, and right hilar and subcari-nal lymphadenopathy Fig. 1F. Dr. Uchida: Tests for hepatitis C virus antibodies and for hepatitis B virus surface antibodies, surface antigen, and core antibodies were negative. Repeat paracentesis was performed, and 3.2 liters of milky-appearing ascitic fluid were removed. Results of the ascitic fluid analysis are shown in Table 1. An acid-fast stain of a concentrated specimen of ascitic fluid was negative. Cytologic examination of the ascitic fluid revealed no malignant cells. A fluoroscopically guided transjugular liver biopsy was also performed. The hepatic venous pressure gradient HVPG was 2 mm Hg normal value, 5; the right atrial pressure was 7 mm Hg, the wedged hepatic venous pressure 11 mm Hg, and the free hepatic venous pressure 9 mm Hg. Dr. Megan J. Fitzpatrick: Histologic examination of the liver-biopsy specimen revealed mild mixed portal inflammation and grade 1 steatosis without steatohepatitis. A trichrome stain showed mild portal tract edema but no fibrosis. Dr. Uchida: Mycobacterial cultures of the as-citic fluid were negative. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "High-grade B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified.", "prediction": "1. Protein-losing enteropathy: The patient's history of leg edema, chronic diarrhea, low serum protein levels, and extensive intestinal involvement are highly suggestive of protein-losing enteropathy.\n2. Lymphangiectasia: The presence of milky ascitic fluid and diffuse small bowel wall thickening could indicate intestinal lymphangiectasia, leading to protein loss and ascites.\n3. Hypogammaglobulinemia-related enteropathy: Given the low immunoglobulin levels and history of hypogammaglobulinemia, an enteropathy related to immunodeficiency might be considered.\n4. Nephrotic syndrome: Persistent edema and low albumin levels without significant renal dysfunction could indicate nephrotic syndrome despite normal protein levels in urine samples.\n5. Cirrhosis with portal hypertension: Multiple hypoenhancing liver lesions, ascites, and varices suggest underlying cirrhosis even with normal hepatic venous pressure gradient.\n6. Whipple’s disease: Chronic diarrhea, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, and multiple systemic symptoms are consistent with Whipple’s disease, despite the absence of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive macrophages in biopsies.\n7. Gastrointestinal malignancy with secondary lymphatic invasion: New liver lesions, diffuse small bowel thickening, and lymphadenopathy are concerning for a malignancy, possibly with lymphatic obstruction.\n8. Chronic heart failure: Dyspnea on exertion, leg edema, and ascites could also stem from chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), especially in light of long-term diabetes mellitus.\n9. Amyloidosis: Chronic diarrhea, edema, and organomegaly might point toward systemic amyloidosis, although biopsy results do not currently show typical amyloid deposits.\n10. Disseminated tuberculosis: Despite negative acid-fast stains and cultures, the chronic multisystemic involvement and lymphadenopathy warrant consideration of tuberculosis, especially in endemic areas or immunocompromised states."}

Alba: A 57-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of persistent cough and pulmonary opacities. Six years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of poly-arteritis nodosa after fevers, arthralgias, abdominal pain, and testicular pain had developed. He was treated with six cycles of cyclophosphamide, followed by maintenance therapy with prednisone and weekly methotrexate. He was treated intermittently with escalating doses of prednisone because of episodic worsening of the arthralgias; the most recent such treatment was given 5 months before the current admission. At that time, owing to an exacerbation of pain associated with the arthralgias and at the direction of his physician, he increased the amount of oxycodone he had been taking. He also reported fever and weight loss. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Jeanna M. Harvey Barnes: Five months before the current admission, computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Chest CT Fig. 1A and 1B revealed mild centrilobular emphysema and small pulmonary nodules that appeared unchanged from those seen on imaging that had been performed 6 years earlier. There was also diffuse thickening of the bronchial wall, layering secretions in the trachea and right main-stem bronchus, a mildly patulous esophagus, and a small hiatal hernia. There were no clinically significant findings on imaging of the abdomen or pelvis. Dr. Alba: A test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Serum protein electrophoresis results were normal, as was the IgG level. Three months before the current admission, the patient had fevers and a cough productive of green sputum. The temperature was 37.3C and the oxygen saturation 89 while he was breathing ambient air. Thrush was present in the orophar-ynx. Auscultation of the chest revealed crackles and wheezing in the right lung. Blood levels of electrolytes, lipase, amylase, lactate dehydrogenase, and troponin were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 1C) showed patchy and confluent opacities predominantly in the right mid and lower lung. Dr. Alba: The patient was admitted to this hospital, and empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin was administered. A blood test for cryptococcal antigen and a urine test for legionella antigen were negative. A sputum culture grew normal respiratory flora and Candida albicans; a test for Pneumocystis jirovecii was negative. During the next several days, fever resolved and the oxygen saturation and white-cell count normalized. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was discharged home to complete a 14-day course of levofloxacin. After he completed the course of levofloxacin, his cough and constitutional symptoms abated partially but did not return to baseline. His primary care physician prescribed inhaled fluticasone–salmeterol and as-needed inhaled albuterol. Six weeks after the patient was discharged from this hospital (approximately 5 weeks before the current admission), his wife began to have a nonproductive cough and rhinorrhea; several days later, the patient had similar symptoms, along with increased production of brown sputum. He sought medical attention after awakening with coughing and dyspnea. The temperature was 38.4°C and the oxygen saturation 89% while he was breathing ambient air. Dr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 1D) obtained 1 month before the current admission showed patchy opacities in the right upper, middle, and lower lobes. Dr. Alba: Electrolyte levels were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was again admitted to this hospital, and empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin; oral prednisone; and inhaled albuterol and ipratropium was administered. A sputum culture grew normal respiratory flora and C. albicans. After two days, the patient was discharged home to complete a 7-day course of levofloxacin. Over the course of the next 3 weeks, the patient had malaise, productive cough, fever, and sweats. He stopped smoking cigarettes. Eight days before the current admission, the patient was referred to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 37.2°C and the oxygen saturation 94% while he was breathing ambient air. There were crackles in both lung bases and in the right middle lung field, with no wheezes. Blood levels of electrolytes and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests and urinalysis; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 2A) showed multifocal reticulonodular and patchy opacities, which were confluent in the right lower lobe. CT of the chest (Figure 2B and 2C), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal clustered, centrilobular nodules and opacities in a tree-in-bud pattern with scattered areas of focal consolidation that were present predominantly in the right middle and lower lobes. There was associated mild mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy that had not been present on the previous chest CT examination. Dr. Alba: The patient was again admitted to this hospital, and additional testing was performed. Tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies were negative, and blood levels of C3 and C4 were normal. A urine test for legionella antigen was negative. On the third hospital day, a bronchoscopy and a transbronchial biopsy were performed. The bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) fluid obtained from the right middle lobe was cloudy; analysis of the fluid revealed 888 nucleated cells per microliter (of which 48% were neutrophils and 2% were lymphocytes, with no eosinophils). Gram’s staining of the BAL fluid revealed neutrophils and sparse growth of gram-positive cocci. Staining for acid-fast organisms was negative; culture grew normal respiratory flora and C. albicans. Tests of the BAL fluid for influenza virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, P. jirovecii, histoplasma antigen, and blastomyces antigen were negative, as were cultures for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus. An interferon-γ release assay for M. tuberculosis was also negative. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day, with follow-up scheduled in the pulmonary clinic for 3 weeks later. Four days after the patient was discharged, a BAL test for galactomannan returned a positive result (antigen index, ≥3.750; negative test, <0.5), and the patient was readmitted to this hospital. He reported ongoing dyspnea, cough with thick white sputum, and persistent fever with a temperature of up to 39.3°C.  A review of systems was notable for diffuse chronic arthralgias, a bitter taste in the mouth, and intermittent dysphagia.  There was no chest pain, edema, orthopnea, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, or rash, and he had no known current sick contacts.  The weight was 5 kg lower than that recorded 1 year earlier.  Medical history was notable for polyarteritis nodosa, deep venous thrombosis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), pancreatitis in the context of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, osteopenia, and chronic neuropathic pain.  Medications included aspirin, prednisone, methotrexate, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, folate supplementation, metformin, atenolol, simvastatin, pregabalin, and as-needed oxycodone, as well as inhaled fluticasone–salmeterol and albuterol as needed.  Lisinopril had reportedly caused pancreatic inflammation;  there were no other known adverse reactions to medications.  The patient was of White European ancestry.  He lived in New England with his wife and was retired from an office position.  Three decades earlier, he had worked in a machine shop where solvents, fuels, and sulfur compounds were used but had had no known exposure to these agents.  There was no history of exposure to mold, pets, or asbestos.  He had received influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.  He and his wife had traveled within the United States and to the Caribbean.  He had smoked 1.5 packs of cigarettes per day for 30 years but had quit in the weeks before the current admission.  He had previously smoked marijuana, rarely consumed alcohol, and never used other substances.  There was no family history of autoimmune or pulmonary disease;  his father had died from colorectal cancer, and his mother had had esophageal cancer and had died after a stroke.  His three adult children were healthy.  The temperature was 36.6°C, the heart rate 75 beats per minute, the blood pressure 135//69 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute.  He had a slightly cushingoid appearance and was tachypneic, although he was able to speak in full sentences.  Auscultation of the chest revealed rales at the right lung base, rhonchi during both the inspiratory and expiratory phases that were more pronounced in the right lung than in the left lung, and intermittent inspiratory wheezing in the right lung.  The rest of the examination was normal.  Dr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 2D) showed progression of the diffuse bilateral reticulonodular opacities, with additional patchy opacities in the right lung and left lower lobe, as compared with the image obtained 1 week earlier.  Dr. Alba: Blood levels of electrolytes, amylase, lipase, N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney and liver function;  other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.  Urinalysis was normal, and a urine test for legionella antigen was negative.  The BAL-fluid culture obtained during the previous admission grew enterococcus species, C. albicans, and C. glabrata;  no mycobacteria grew in any of three induced sputum samples obtained during the previous admission.  Empirical treatment with intravenous voriconazole was initiated, and ongoing treatment with methotrexate was interrupted.  Cytologic analysis of the BAL fluid and the transbronchial-biopsy specimen obtained during the previous admission revealed evidence of acute inflammation, bronchial columnar cells, and pulmonary macrophages.  There were no malignant cells.  Evaluation of the bronchial mucosa revealed no abnormalities.  On the second hospital day, the temperature was 37.9°C and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute.  Dr. Harvey Barnes: Repeat CT of the chest (Figure 2E and 2F) was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material as part of a pulmonary embolism protocol.  This imaging study revealed extensive centrilobular pulmonary nodules, opacities in a tree-in-bud pattern, and patchy ground-glass opacities.  There was bronchial wall thickening with mucus plugging, predominantly affecting the lower lobes.  There were additional areas of nodular consolidation that were more prominent in the right lung than in the left lung.  These findings indicated a progression of disease as compared with the chest CT performed 1 week before the current admission.  There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism.  Dr. Alba: Additional induced sputum samples were obtained for culture;  Gram’s staining revealed abundant neutrophils and abundant mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.  On the third hospital day, the temperature was 36.9°C and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute. Diagnostic tests were performed. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Aspiration pneumonia. ", "prediction": "1. Chronic Invasive Aspergillosis: Given the positive galactomannan test, prolonged immunocompromised state due to prolonged corticosteroid use, and CT findings of tree-in-bud pattern and ground-glass opacities, chronic invasive aspergillosis is highly likely.\n2. Bronchiectasis: This is suggested by the recurrent pulmonary infections, bronchial wall thickening with mucus plugging, and history of chronic cough productive of sputum.\n3. Bacterial Pneumonia: Recurrent episodes of productive cough, fever, and radiographic opacities, along with empirical treatment success with antibiotics, suggest recurrent bacterial infections possibly secondary to an underlying abnormality.\n4. Methotrexate Pneumonitis: The use of methotrexate, especially with the respiratory symptoms and the chest findings of ground-glass opacities, raises the possibility of drug-induced pneumonitis.\n5. Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Infection: Chronic lung diseases, repeated antibiotic treatments, and mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms in cultures suggest possible infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or other resistant pathogens.\n6. Connective Tissue-Related Interstitial Lung Disease: Given the history of polyarteritis nodosa and arthralgias, an associated interstitial lung disease secondary to underlying autoimmune pathology should be considered.\n7. Atypical Mycobacterial Infection: Given the immunosuppressed state, persistent cough, and negative culture for typical pathogens, atypical mycobacterial infections remain a differential despite multiple negative tests for Mycobacterium spp.\n8. Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia: The imaging findings of patchy opacities and persistent symptoms despite treatment may suggest organizing pneumonia, a disorder often associated with autoimmune conditions.\n9. Fungal Pneumonia (Non-Aspergillus Species): Persistent pulmonary symptoms, history of immunosuppression, and identification of Candida species in cultures might indicate a fungal etiology, though less common species should be investigated.\n10. Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis: The radiologic evidence of ground-glass opacities and reticulonodular pattern alongside dyspnea and productive cough could also fit the description of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, though less likely than other differentials."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Jessica L. Logeman Medicine: A 55-year-old man was transferred to this hospital for evaluation of a mediastinal mass that was identified as part of an evaluation for waxing and waning fevers, night sweats, and fatigue. The patient had been well until 3 months before admission to this hospital, when fatigue and a transient pruritic maculopapular rash on the forearm developed. During the next 6 weeks, the forearm rash resolved but fatigue persisted. The patient began to take naps during the daytime and was unable to put in full days at his job in construction work. He also began to have night sweats and fevers with temperatures of up to 37.8C. Twenty-seven days before admission to this hospital, the patient found that he was unable to work because of fatigue, and he sought evaluation in the emergency department of another hospital. Blood tests for anaplasma and babesia nucleic acids were negative, but screening and confirmatory tests for Lyme disease IgM and IgG were positive. A diagnosis of Lyme disease was made, and treatment with doxycycline was initiated. Because gastrointestinal upset developed, doxycycline was discontinued and amoxicillin was prescribed for the remainder of the 14-day course. Sixteen days before admission to this hospital, the patient began to have chest discomfort, which he described as a sensation of a softball in his left lower chest. The chest discomfort limited his ability to breathe, and his primary care physician referred him to the emergency department of the other hospital. On evaluation, he reported increasing fatigue and malaise, night sweats, and fevers, along with diffuse arthralgias and myalgias, headache, photophobia with some visual flashes, dyspnea on exertion, edema, a pruritic erythematous rash on his chest, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort and distention, and watery diarrhea that occurred three times per day. On examination, the temperature was 36.8C, the blood pressure 145/84 mm Hg, the heart rate 61 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 83.9 kg and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 28.1. There was a faint diffuse erythematous macular rash on the anterior portion of the chest. The abdomen was mildly distended and diffusely tender. Blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and lipase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood was obtained for microbiologic culture. An electrocardiogram was normal. Intravenous normal sa-line and oral acetaminophen were administered, as was empirical treatment with intravenous piperacillintazobactam, hydromorphone, and ondansetron. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. Dr. Reece J. Goiffon: Fifteen days before admission to this hospital, computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis Fig. 1A, 1B, and 1C, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a bi-lobed heterogeneous soft-tissue mass, measuring 6.1 cm by 2.8 cm, in the anterior mediastinum. There were multiple enlarged subcarinal and mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to 15 mm in short-axis diameter, multiple enlarged mes-enteric lymph nodes measuring up to 11 mm in short-axis diameter, mesenteric fat stranding, and trace ascites. Dr. Logeman: Abdominal discomfort persisted; piperacillintazobactam was discontinued and ceftriaxone was prescribed. Two days later, CT of the abdomen, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new pulmonary edema, new small bilateral pleural effusions, and an increased volume of ascites. The patient was transferred to a second hospital for further evaluation. Physical examination was notable for mild abdominal tenderness and distention, as well as leg edema. Blood levels of alanine aminotrans-ferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin and a urinalysis were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose FDGpositron-emission tomography PET Fig. 1D revealed indeterminate low-level FDG uptake in the anterior mediastinal soft tissue, as well as in pleural effusions and medias-tinal lymph nodes. During the next week, dyspnea and abdominal pain persisted. Edema increased, specifically in the abdomen, legs, and face; the weight increased to 93.0 kg. Intravenous ceftriaxone and metoclopramide and oral hydromorphone, ondan-setron, and lactulose were administered. Additional laboratory tests were performed Table 2. On the eighth day at the second hospital, video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed. The mediastinum reportedly appeared inflamed. The patient underwent an evacuation of pleural fluid and a biopsy of mediastinal soft tissue and lymph nodes primarily in the subcarinal window level VII. On pathological examination of the biopsy specimens, the mediastinal soft tissue showed fibroconnective and adipose tissue with fibrosis, mild inflammation and fat necrosis, prominent capillary proliferation, and congestion; the lymph nodes were reportedly mildly abnormal. Microbiologic evaluation of the biopsy specimens revealed occasional leukocytes but no acid-fast bacilli or fungal elements. On flow cytom-etry of the biopsy specimens, the mediastinal soft tissue did not show any abnormal cell populations; the lymph nodes contained polyclonal B-cell and heterogeneous T-cell populations, without immunophenotypic evidence of lymphoma. Bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures of the biopsy specimens were negative. Cytologic examination of the pleural fluid revealed reactive mesothelial cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes but no malignant cells. After the procedure, the creatinine level increased to 2.93 mg per deciliter reference range, 0.50 to 1.30. Examination of urinary sediment revealed hyaline and granular casts. Intravenous furosemide was administered. On the 15th day at the second hospital, the patient was transferred to this hospital. On arrival, the patient reported persistent fatigue, mild dyspnea, abdominal distention, edema, and anorexia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and the chest rash had resolved. Fevers and night sweats had occurred in a waxing and waning pattern during the previous weeks. He reported intermittent photophobia and headache, without neck stiffness or phonophobia, and had no other neurologic symptoms. The patient had no history of illness and had not received routine medical care as an adult. He took ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed and had no known allergies to medications. He had been exposed to dust through his job in construction work. He lived with his wife, child, and pet dog and cat in a coastal wooded community in New England. He frequently spent time outdoors, either working or playing golf, and had received multiple tick bites. He had traveled to the Mediterranean and Oceania regions in previous years and, more recently, to the southwestern United States. The patient had never used tobacco or illicit drugs and drank beer rarely. His father had had prostate cancer and colon cancer. On examination, the temperature was 36.8C, the blood pressure 148/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 91.7 kg. Neurologic examination was normal, and there was no nuchal rigidity. There were inspiratory crackles in the left lung. The abdomen was mildly distended and diffusely tender. Mild fluctuance was noted on the right side of the chest, at the site of the surgical incision. There was no palpable cervical, supracla-vicular, submandibular, submental, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There was 2 pitting edema in the legs. Blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspar-tate aminotransferase, bilirubin, ceruloplasmin, fibrinogen, folate, globulin, haptoglobin, and vitamin B12 were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed cloudy yellow urine with 2 protein and 3 to 5 red cells per high-power field reference range, 0 to 2. An electrocardiogram was normal. Dr. Goiffon: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis Fig. 1E, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed an anterior mediastinal mass, measuring 6.1 cm by 1.9 cm, which was slightly smaller than it had been on the previous chest CT. There were enlarged perivascular, paratracheal, subcarinal, and aortopulmonary mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to 12 mm in short-axis diameter with heterogeneous enhancement. Increased pulmonary edema, moderate bilateral pleural effusions, moderate-volume ascites, mild splenomegaly, and multiple subcentimeter mesenteric lymph nodes were detected. Dr. Logeman: On the third hospital day, magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head revealed no abnormalities. On the fourth day, a transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. Intravenous furosemide and oral acetaminophen were administered. Lumbar puncture was performed, and 26 ml of colorless fluid was removed; opening pressure was not measured. Results of cere-brospinal fluid analysis are shown in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. On the fifth day, renal ultrasonography revealed kidneys of normal size with normal parenchyma and no hydronephrosis. Diagnostic paracentesis was performed; results of ascitic fluid analysis are shown in Table S1. Dr. Goiffon: On the 13th day, MRI of the chest was started but could not be completed because the patient had respiratory distress when placed in the prone position. Sequences that were obtained before termination of the study Fig. 1F showed an anterior mediastinal soft-tissue mass with hypointensity on steady-state gradient echo imaging; the mass was smaller than it had been on chest CT performed before transfer to this hospital. In addition, there were enlarged medi-astinal lymph nodes, large bilateral pleural effusions, ascites, and a hematoma at the site of the surgical incision.

Lymphoma: The presence of a mediastinal mass with enlarged lymph nodes, waxing and waning fevers, night sweats, and persistent fatigue are suggestive of a lymphoproliferative disorder, such as lymphoma.\n2. Sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis can present with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, fatigue, and systemic symptoms like night sweats and fever, often with non-caseating granulomas on pathology.\n3. Tuberculosis: This diagnosis is considered given the presence of persistent fevers, night sweats, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy, which are classic symptoms of tuberculosis, though cultures are negative.\n4. Thymoma: An anterior mediastinal mass measuring 6.1 cm by 2.8 cm raises suspicion for a thymoma, which can be associated with systemic symptoms and paraneoplastic syndromes.\n5. Castleman Disease: This rare disorder can present with a mediastinal mass, lymphadenopathy, systemic inflammation (fevers, night sweats), and the occasional rash, as seen in this patient.\n6. Infectious Mononucleosis: Despite the lack of typical pharyngitis or splenomegaly, the systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy could suggest EBV or CMV infection, particularly given the polyclonal B-cell population.\n7. Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS): Although rare in adults, this syndrome can manifest as chronic lymphadenopathy, autoimmunity, and systemic inflammatory symptoms.\n8. Mediastinal Germ Cell Tumor: The demographics and mediastinal mass could suggest a non-seminomatous germ cell tumor, which can sometimes present with systemic symptoms.\n9. Inflammatory Pseudotumor: A benign condition characterized by a mass with systemic inflammation, presenting with fevers, night sweats, and malaise.\n10. Chronic Granulomatous Disease: Despite the abnormal onset age, CGD can lead to recurrent infections and granulomatous inflammation, potentially explaining the lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms."}

The patient had been well until 5 days before this admission, when fever, nausea, diarrhea, muscle aches, and chest pain developed. The chest pain radiated to the left shoulder and was worse when he took deep breaths or was lying flat. One episode of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis occurred. On the second day of illness, the patient presented to his primary care clinic at another hospital, where a viral illness was diagnosed. An intramuscular glucocorticoid injection was administered, nebulized albuterol was prescribed, and the patient was advised to take ibuprofen and acetaminophen. During the next 3 days, fever and diarrhea resolved, but chest pain, muscle aches, and nausea persisted and were accompanied by decreased appetite and cold, pale fingers. On the morning of admission, lightheadedness developed. When the patient stood to get a drink of water, he felt unsteady, his vision faded, and syncope occurred. He regained consciousness within 1 minute. Emergency medical services were called, and on arrival they found that the patient was alert and the vital signs were normal. The peripheral blood glucose level, obtained by fingerstick testing, was 24 mg per deciliter 1.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter 3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter. Thiamine and 50 ml of a 50 dextrose solution were administered intravenously, and the patient was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of the other hospital. On arrival at the other hospital, the patient reported pleuritic left parasternal chest pain, which he rated at 4 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The temperature was 36.9C, the pulse 106 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93 while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. The pulse oximeter plethysmographic waveform was noted to be of low amplitude, and the oxygen saturation was difficult to obtain. The weight was 95.3 kg and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 32. The fingers were cool, with a capillary refill time of 3 to 4 seconds. Blood levels of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and lactic acid were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Serum toxicologic screening was negative. Chest radiography revealed a borderline enlarged cardiac silhouette. ECG and echocardiography were performed. Dr. Oscar J. Benavidez: An ECG showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 100 beats per minute Fig. 1. ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression were present in leads I and II and the lateral precordial leads. There was no atrial or ventricular ectopy. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and normal left ventricular volume and systolic function, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 63; there were no wall-motion abnormalities. The right ventricular volume and systolic function were normal. There was no mitral valve prolapse, but mild mitral regurgitation was present. The aortic dimensions were within normal limits, and there was no pericardial effusion. Doppler imaging revealed normal systolic and diastolic velocities. Dr. Wolf: Three hours after arrival, the patient was transferred by ambulance to the pediatric ICU of this hospital. On admission, he reported that he had intentionally lost 45 kg of weight during the previous year. He took no medications, herbal remedies, or nutritional supplements and had no known allergies. His immunizations were reportedly current. The patient lived with his mother and younger brother. He played sports; he had no known exposure to sick persons and was not sexually active. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His mother had hypertension, unspecified heart disease, and a history of recurrent miscarriages. A brother had died at 56 days of age from sudden infant death syndrome. His maternal grandmother had hypertension and diabetes, and a maternal aunt had systemic lupus erythematosus SLE with nephritis. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 37.6C, the pulse 111 beats per minute, the blood pressure 148/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal can-nula at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. The fingers were cold and pale. Examination of the skin revealed striae on the abdomen. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Tests for influenza virus, respiratory syncy-tial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and human immunodeficiency virus HIV were negative. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.031, a pH of 6.0, and 1 protein. Intravenous fluids, ibuprofen, and famotidine were administered, and supplemental oxygen was discontinued. During the next 24 hours, the chest pain and ECG abnormalities abated and the blood levels of creatine kinase, troponin T, alanine amino-transferase, and aspartate aminotransferase decreased. The patient was discharged home; he was advised to take acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed for pain, and a follow-up appointment with a pediatric cardiologist was scheduled. Ten days later, in the cardiology clinic, the patient reported that the chest pain had resolved. He appeared well. The pulse was 86 beats per minute and the blood pressure 151/77 mm Hg. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Results of laboratory tests performed in the patients primary care clinic 3 days earlier are shown in Table 1. ECG was performed. Dr. Benavidez: An ECG showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 82 beats per minute Fig. 1. There were nonspecific ST-segment changes in leads III and aVF; ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression were no longer present. Dr. Wolf: Ultrasonographic examination of the kidneys was normal. Amlodipine was prescribed, and follow-up appointments with a pediatric ne-phrologist and a medical geneticist were scheduled but not kept by the patient. Results of laboratory tests performed in the primary care clinic 6 weeks after discharge are shown in Table 1. Approximately 9.5 months after admission to the pediatric ICU, the patient presented to the emergency department of the other hospital with a 15-hour history of fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, midsternal chest pain, and light-headedness. He rated the chest pain at 6 out of 10. The temperature was 39.3C, the pulse 119 beats per minute, the blood pressure 134/61 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while he was breathing ambient air. On examination, the capillary refill time in the fingers was 3 to 4 seconds. ECG and imaging studies were performed. Dr. Benavidez: An ECG showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 126 beats per minute Fig. 1. There were frequent premature atrial and ventricular contractions, along with diffuse flattening of T waves. Dr. Sjirk J. Westra: Frontal and lateral chest radiography revealed cardiomegaly, as characterized by an increased cardiothoracic ratio, with predominant enlargement of the left atrium Fig. 2. Pulmonary vascular congestion with mild interstitial pulmonary edema and a small left pleural effusion were detected; these findings are suggestive of congestive heart failure. Dr. Wolf: The patient was again transferred by ambulance to the pediatric ICU of this hospital. On admission, he reported that the chest pain had abated. He appeared to be in no distress. The temperature was 38.8C, the pulse 134 beats per minute, the blood pressure 129/49 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 27 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 83.9 kg. On auscultation of the heart, the rhythm was irregular; the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.027, a pH of 5.0, and 1 protein. Intravenous fluids, magnesium sulfate, sodium phosphate, amlodipine, famotidine, ondansetron, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen were administered. During the next 2 days, fever and intermittent chest pain persisted and hypertension developed, with blood-pressure measurements as high as 187/97 mm Hg. Hydralazine and labetalol were administered, and the dose of amlodipine was increased. On examination, strength in the proximal muscles of the arms and legs was graded as 4 out of 5, with 5 indicating normal muscular contraction against full resistance. There were episodes during which the fingers were cold and pale; no nailfold capillary abnormalities were seen. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. The blood level of troponin T decreased to 0.57 ng per milliliter and the blood level of cre-atine kinase MB isoenzyme decreased to 50.2 ng per milliliter, whereas the blood level of creatine kinase increased to 8336 U per liter; the urine level of myoglobin was 283 g per liter reference value, 21. The results of thyroid-function tests were normal. Some peripheral blood glucose measurements, obtained by fingerstick testing, were as low as 22 mg per deciliter 1.2 mmol per liter, despite a regular diet and the administration of dextrose-containing intravenous fluids. These values were not verified by concurrent central venous blood glucose measurements. Additional test results were received, and a diagnosis was made.

Selen: A 29-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent bone fractures and hypophosphatemia. The patient had been well until 19 months before admission, when pain in the right midfoot developed during a vacation in Europe. On her return to the United States, she was evaluated by her primary care physician at a clinic affiliated with another hospital; an orthotic device was recommended, but the foot pain did not decrease with use of the device. Three months later, the pain in the right foot increased in severity after a second vacation in Europe. Radiography of the right foot reportedly revealed no fracture; physical therapy was recommended. During the subsequent 8 months, the pain continued to gradually increase in severity, was worse when the patient stood upright or walked, and was relieved with the administration of ibuprofen. Eight months before admission, the patient tripped, and the severity of pain in the right foot increased suddenly. She was evaluated in the orthopedic clinic of this hospital. On examination, the height was 173 cm, the weight 115 kg, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 38.6. There was tenderness over the right third metatarsal. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Rene Balza: Radiography of the right foot Fig. 1A revealed a fracture of the third metatarsal shaft. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the right foot revealed a nondisplaced, incompletely healed transverse fracture of the third metatarsal shaft, as well as subchondral sclerosis and bone marrow edema within the distal navicular bone and in the calcaneocuboid joint. Bone stimulation was recommended, but the patients pain did not abate after these treatments. Dr. Selen: Seven months before admission, the patient had increased pain in the right foot after a fall while walking on ice. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Balza: Radiography of the right foot Fig. 1B revealed fractures of the distal fourth and fifth metatarsals. Dr. Selen: Five months before admission, the second metatarsal region of the right foot was tender on palpation after the patient had walked up a flight of stairs. However, no evidence of a fracture was seen on radiography. Four months before admission, the patient was evaluated in the endocrinology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. The calcium level was 9.5 mg per deciliter 2.4 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter 2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter, the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level 26 ng per milliliter 65 nmol per liter; reference range, 20 to 80 ng per deciliter 50 to 200 nmol per liter, and the parathyroid hormone level 45 pg per milliliter reference range, 10 to 60; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, performed for the assessment of bone mineral density, revealed normal bone mass in the lumbar spine z score, 0.0; reference range, 1.9 to 1.9 and in the femoral neck z score, 0.4; reference range, 1.9 to 1.9. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation and weight loss were recommended. The pain in the right foot persisted, and additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Balza: Three months before admission, MRI of the right foot Fig. 1C and 1D showed a non-displaced fracture of the second metatarsal metadiaphysis with associated bone and soft-tissue edema, a nondisplaced fracture of the medial cuneiform, and healing fractures of the third, fourth, and fifth metatarsals. A controlled ankle motion walking boot and crutches were recommended for ambulation. Dr. Selen: During the next 3 months, the pain in the right foot persisted, and new pain developed in the left foot. The patient was seen in the pain medicine and podiatry clinics affiliated with the other hospital. Diagnoses of plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinitis, and sinus tarsi syndrome were considered. Treatment with methyl-prednisolone and celecoxib was initiated, and the patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. On evaluation in the rheumatology clinic, the patient reported bilateral foot and ankle pain and swelling that was greater in the right foot and ankle than in the left, as well as stiffness and warmth in the ankles. There was lower back pain and bilateral hip pain, which was greater on the right side than on the left side. The patient reported that the back and hip pain had been present since she was a teenager but had gradually increased in severity during the previous year. Fatigue and generalized weakness had developed and worsened during the previous month. There was no fever, weight loss, or change in diet. Menarche had occurred when the patient was 11 years of age, and menstrual cycles had been regular since then. There was a history of fractures of the left wrist in childhood. Other medical history included obesity, hyperlipidemia, anxiety, nephrolithiasis, biliary dyskinesia which had led to cholecystectomy 1 year before this admission, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease diagnosed on the basis of a liver biopsy. Medications included celecoxib, ergocalciferol, citalopram, and lorazepam; she had no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England and had previously worked as a nurse; however, she was unable to work during the previous 8 months because of pain and difficulty with ambulation. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had osteopenia; her mother, father, and sister had psoriasis; her father had psoriatic arthritis; and her brother had the Williams syndrome, a rare genetic and developmental disorder. On examination, the temperature was 36.9C, the blood pressure 12178, and the heart rate 94 beats per minute. Dentition was normal, and the gait was antalgic. Proximal muscle strength was intact in both arms 55 and slightly reduced in the legs 45. There was tenderness over the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints that was more pronounced on the right side than on the left side. The FABER test  in which the leg is flexed and the thigh is abducted and externally rotated  elicited pain in both hips. There was tenderness over the right midfoot and warmth and swelling of the ankles. No musculoskeletal deformities, bowing of the legs, lymphadenopa-thy, skin lesions, or rashes were noted. The blood level of phosphorus was 1.0 mg per deciliter 0.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 2.6 to 4.5 mg per deciliter 0.8 to 1.5 mmol per liter; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was instructed to go to the emergency department of this hospital. Intravenous sodium phosphate and oral potassium phosphate were administered. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Balza: Radiography of the lumbar spine, pelvis, hips, and ankles revealed anterolisthesis of L4 and L5 with a defect in the pars interarticu-laris; there were no fractures. On radiography of the right foot, a fracture in the third metatarsal was initially identified 8 months before admission Fig. 1A, followed by the development of fractures in the fourth and fifth metatarsals 1 month later Fig. 1B. Subsequently, T2-weighted MRI of the sacrum with fat suppression performed on admission Fig. 1E and 1F revealed vertically oriented hypointense bands in the bilateral sacral alae and a horizontally oriented hypoin-tense band in S2, as well as bone marrow edema adjacent to the fracture lines; the combination of these findings was consistent with an H-shaped sacral insufficiency fracture.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Jon S. DuBois: A 29-year-old woman was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital for the management of a soft-tissue mass in the head of the pancreas. The patient had been well until 7 weeks before this presentation, when progressive pruritus throughout the body developed, along with nausea, bloating, and watery mustard-colored diarrhea. She had eaten sushi for dinner the previous night. She was evaluated in an urgent care clinic in the southeastern United States; she had recently moved there from New England. An injection of methylpredniso-lone was administered, and hydroxyzine and diphenoxylateatropine were prescribed. During the next 3 weeks, the symptoms did not abate and jaundice developed, along with new discomfort in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, decreased appetite, and amber-colored urine. Four weeks before this presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of a local hospital. The alanine aminotransferase level was 327 U per liter reference range, 1 to 33, the aspartate aminotransferase level 104 U per liter reference range, 1 to 32, and the total bilirubin level 5.8 mg per deciliter reference range, 0.1 to 1.2. The carbohydrate antigen 19-9 CA 19-9 level was 73 U per milliliter reference range, 0 to 35. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Computed tomography CT of the abdomen, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed a distended gallbladder with sludge, as well as dilated hepatic and pancreatic ducts. The patient was admitted to the local hospital. On the second hospital day, results of liver-function tests improved, and she was discharged home with plans for an outpatient evaluation with a gastroenterologist. However, the next day, the patient flew back to New England and presented to the emergency department of a second hospital for further evaluation. On evaluation, she described persistent diffuse pruritus, nausea, right upper abdominal CME at NEJM.org pain, and mustard-colored diarrhea. She also reported fatigue, unintentional weight loss of 3.2 kg during the past month, and poor sleep. The patient had a history of anxiety and depression. She took no medications and had no known drug allergies. Aside from her recent move to the southeastern United States and trip back to New England, there was no recent travel. She worked seasonally as an official at sporting events. She smoked cigarettes occasionally, drank alcohol rarely, and did not use illicit drugs. Her family history included colon cancer in her maternal grandmother, maternal grandfather, and paternal grandmother; breast cancer in her maternal aunt and paternal aunt; and thyroid cancer in her father. In addition, her maternal grandmother had diabetes, and both grandmothers had coronary artery disease. On examination, the temperature was 36.9C, the blood pressure 155/82 mm Hg, the pulse 94 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was thin and appeared jaundiced, with scleral icterus. She had diffuse excoriations from scratching. The bowel sounds were normal. There was mild tenderness in the right upper abdomen on palpation, but masses and hepatosplenomegaly were not detected. The remainder of the examination was normal. The alanine aminotransferase level was 85 U per liter, the aspartate aminotransferase level 267 U per liter, and the total bilirubin level 6.7 mg per deciliter. The CA 19-9 level was 79 U per milliliter. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The abdominal CT images obtained at the first hospital were reviewed, and additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Avinash Kambadakone: CT of the abdomen Fig. 1A and 1B, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed diffuse dilatation of the intrahepatic and extra-hepatic biliary ducts, as well as dilatation of the pancreatic ducts. The dilated ducts terminated abruptly in the pancreatic head. There was a hypodense pancreatic mass at the site of duct obstruction. Magnetic resonance cholangiopan-creatography Fig. 1C and 1D also revealed dilatation of the biliary and pancreatic ducts, which narrowed abruptly at the level of the pancreatic head, with a heterogeneously enhancing mass at the site of obstruction. Dr. DuBois: The patient was admitted to the second hospital. Endoscopic retrograde cholan-giopancreatography revealed a stricture in the bile duct at the level of the mass, and a stent was placed. The bilirubin level initially decreased, but pruritus and diarrhea persisted. By the seventh hospital day, the bilirubin level had increased to 12.6 mg per deciliter and the CA 19-9 level had increased to 959 U per milliliter. Additional diagnostic testing was performed. Dr. Kambadakone: Endoscopic ultrasonography Fig. 1E revealed a hypoechoic mass in the pancreatic head. Fine-needle aspiration was performed. Dr. DuBois: The aspirate showed variably atypical epithelium, but the quantity and quality of the findings were insufficient for definitive diagnosis. Given the uncertain diagnosis and the possibility of cancer, a surgical consultation was obtained. Surgical removal of the mass was recommended to establish the definitive diagnosis, but the patient declined surgery. Prednisone was administered, and the pruritus and diarrhea abated. On the 20th hospital day, the patient was discharged with plans for an outpatient followup evaluation with a gastroenterologist. Three days after discharge from the second hospital, the patient was evaluated in the gastro-enterology clinic of this hospital. At that time, her symptoms had resolved, the results of liver-function tests were normal, and the CA 19-9 level had decreased to 80 U per milliliter. IgG levels total and subclasses were normal, and tests for antinuclear antibodies ANA were negative. The possibility of cancer was explained to the patient, and surgical removal of the mass was again recommended, but the patient declined surgery owing to multiple issues related to her work and personal life. A management plan that was acceptable to the patient was adopted during the next 6 months. The patient was closely monitored, and biliary stents were changed when they became occluded. Additional diagnostic procedures were performed, and management decisions were made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. ", "prediction": "1. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma: The hypodense mass in the pancreatic head causing bile duct obstruction, elevated CA 19-9, and jaundice strongly suggest pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\n2. Cholangiocarcinoma: The presence of a stricture in the bile duct and the imaging findings of biliary and pancreatic duct dilatation are consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.\n3. Autoimmune pancreatitis: Responsive to prednisone, the mass and clinical improvement suggest autoimmune pancreatitis, despite normal IgG4 levels.\n4. Chronic pancreatitis: Ongoing inflammation and fibrosis of the pancreas can present with similar features, including mass formation and ductal dilatation.\n5. Pancreatic cystic neoplasm: Cystic lesions of the pancreas, such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, can cause duct obstruction and elevated CA 19-9.\n6. Biliary stones with associated pancreatitis: Gallbladder sludge and ductal dilatation may indicate passage of biliary stones, leading to secondary pancreatitis.\n7. Parasitic infection: Consumption of sushi raises the possibility of a parasitic infection such as opisthorchiasis, which can cause biliary obstruction and hyperbilirubinemia.\n8. Post-inflammatory stricture: Previous inflammation or infection might result in a benign stricture causing ductal dilatation.\n9. Infectious hepatitis: The abnormal liver enzymes and jaundice could be secondary to a viral hepatitis infection, despite imaging findings.\n10. Lymphoma: Primary pancreatic lymphoma could present as a mass with biliary obstruction and systemic symptoms like weight loss and fatigue."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Annabelle Anandappa Medicine: A 25-year-old man with a history of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of vision changes. Ten months before this presentation, the patient was evaluated for fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. Laboratory testing revealed a hemoglobin level of 3.5 g per deciliter reference range, 13.5 to 17.5 and a white-cell count of 23,450 per micro-liter reference range, 4000 to 11,000, with 81 lymphocytes and 4 blasts. A bone marrow biopsy was performed. Dr. Judith A. Ferry: Examination of the bone marrowbiopsy specimen Fig. 1 revealed markedly hypercellular marrow with a loss of normal elements. There were sheets of blasts, including larger cells with oval-to-irregular nuclei, fine chromatin, distinct nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm, as well as more mature-appearing lymphocyte-like blasts with more condensed chromatin. Cytogenetic analysis revealed an abnormal karyotype: 46,XY,t9;22q34;q11.21546,idem,t2;12 p13;p13,?del10p13346,idem,del6p21,add7p132. On next-generation sequencing, SNaPshot analysis identified a RUNX1 mutation, and gene fusion analysis was positive for BCR-ABL1 e13a2. A diagnosis of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with BCR-ABL1 was made. Dr. Anandappa: Induction chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, metho-trexate, cytarabine, and prednisone was administered, along with dasatinib and intrathecal cytarabine, methotrexate, and hydrocortisone. One month later, examination of a bone marrowbiopsy specimen revealed 7 blasts. Treatment with blinatumomab was started, and dasatinib was continued. Seven months before this presentation, examination of a bone marrowbiopsy specimen revealed a complete hematologic response. BCR-ABL1 was undetectable by means of reverse-transcriptasepolymerase-chain-reaction testing. Five months before this presentation, the patient underwent allogeneic hemato-poietic-cell transplantation HCT from a matched, unrelated donor after myeloab-lative conditioning with cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation. Early post-transplantation complications included severe mucositis and febrile neutropenia. Two months before this presentation, examination of a bone marrowbiopsy specimen revealed a complete hematologic response, no BCR-ABL1 rearrangement, and full donor chime-rism. Dasatinib was continued as maintenance therapy. During the next 2 months, the patient had worsening anemia, and dasatinib was stopped. Two days before this presentation, the patient noticed large black blobs that looked like shadows in the periphery of the visual fields of both eyes. There were also intermittent episodes of blurry vision in both eyes that resolved after 10 minutes. Two days later, the patient sought an evaluation in the oncology clinic of this hospital and was transferred to the emergency department for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing vision symptoms but no eye pain, flashing lights, or floaters. He also reported 3 weeks of night sweats, areas of swelling in the neck and groin, and a pruritic rash on the upper chest, upper back, and both arms. He had a history of chronic daily migraine headaches, which had frequently been associated with eye pain and photophobia but had not been associated with vision changes. Other medical history included depression and obesity. Medications included tacrolimus, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, fam-ciclovir, omeprazole, and escitalopram, as well as vitamin D and magnesium supplementation. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in a coastal town in New England with his mother. He had previously worked in the food-service industry. He had never smoked tobacco or used illicit drugs; he drank three cans of beer weekly. His family history included breast cancer and headaches in his maternal grandmother, prostate cancer in his paternal grandfather, and hypertension in his father. On examination, the temperature was 36.9C, the blood pressure 136/88 mm Hg, the pulse 104 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. Visual acuity was 2025 in both eyes with correction, and visual fields were full on confrontation testing. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light. There was no proptosis. Slit-lamp examination revealed few cells in the anterior chamber, and funduscopic examination was normal. Test results for cranial nerve function, strength, sensation, reflexes, coordination, and gait were normal. There was palpable lymphadenopathy in the cervical, clavicular, axillary, and inguinal regions. Discrete papules were present on both arms, and diffuse xerosis and an eczematous rash were present on the upper back and chest. Laboratory testing revealed a platelet count of 47,000 per microliter reference range, 150,000 to 400,000. Blood testing for cytomegalovirus, EpsteinBarr virus EBV, varicellazoster virus, and human herpesvirus 8 HHV-8 DNA was negative. Screening for human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, and Lyme disease was also negative. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear confirmed the presence of anemia and thrombo-cytopenia; there were no schistocytes. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Karen Rodriguez: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head was performed. T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images Fig. 2A and 2B showed multiple new hyperintense lesions, measuring up to 11 mm in greatest dimension, within the supratentorial and infratentorial regions of the brain. Images obtained after the administration of contrast material showed faint enhancement of the lesions. These foci appeared to be centered within the juxtacortical and peri-ventricular white matter and could reflect areas of demyelination, graft-versus-host disease GVHD involving the central nervous system CNS, acute lymphoblastic leukemia with CNS involvement, or an infectious process. There was no abnormal enhancement of the optic nerves or the orbital structures. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose FDGpositron-emission tomography PET and computed tomography CT was also performed. The PET-CT scans Fig. 2C through 2H showed moderate-to- intense FDG uptake associated with widespread lymphadenopathy, including bilateral cervical, axillary, external iliac, and inguinal lymph nodes. There was also abnormal uptake in the spleen. Dr. Anandappa: The patient was admitted to this hospital, and lumbar puncture was performed. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed a total protein level of 147 mg per deciliter reference range, 5 to 55 and a glucose level of 49 mg per deciliter 2.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter 2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter. The white-cell count was 21 per microliter reference range, 0 to 5, with 61 lymphocytes, 27 neutrophils, and 3 eosinophils; the red-cell count was 16,000 per microliter reference range, 0 to 5, with xanthochromia present. Grams staining of cerebrospinal fluid showed a moderate amount of mononuclear cells and no organisms. Cytologic studies were notable for increased lymphocytes and plasma cells. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Plasma-cell myeloma post-transplantation lym-phoproliferative disorder. ", "prediction": "1. Central nervous system (CNS) relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL): Given the history of ALL, hyperintense brain lesions on MRI, and abnormal lymphocyte count in the CSF, CNS relapse of leukemia is a primary consideration.\n2. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) involving the CNS: The patient’s recent allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation and the presence of hyperintense lesions on MRI could indicate CNS involvement by GVHD.\n3. Opportunistic CNS infection: The immunosuppressed state post-transplant and MRI findings could suggest an opportunistic infection such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) or toxoplasmosis.\n4. Lymphoma: The widespread FDG uptake in lymph nodes and spleen might suggest a secondary malignancy like lymphoma, which can involve CNS and peripheral nodes.\n5. Viral encephalitis: Although tested negative for common viruses, other viral infections could present with hyperintense brain lesions and symptoms of encephalitis.\n6. Multiple sclerosis: Although less likely given the patient's history, the MRI findings of juxtacortical and periventricular white matter lesions could resemble demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis.\n7. Intracranial metastases: The hyperintense lesions identified on MRI could represent metastases from an undiagnosed primary malignancy.\n8. Paraneoplastic syndrome: The neurological symptoms and brain lesions may be secondary to a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with malignancy.\n9. Vasculitis: CNS vasculitis could present with similar MRI findings and could be secondary to the underlying malignancy or a standalone autoimmune condition.\n10. Tuberculosis: CNS tuberculosis, while rare, could be considered given the immunocompromised state and persistent lymphadenopathy despite the absence of respiratory symptoms."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Samantha D. Martin Pediatrics: A 17-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital during the coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19 pandemic because of fever and cough. The patient had been well until 10 days before admission, when fever and cough that was productive of clear sputum developed. She also had fatigue, eye redness, sore throat, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and myalgias. Seven days before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the urgent care clinic of another hospital. On examination, there was conjunctival injection in both eyes. The lungs were clear on auscultation, and the remainder of the physical examination was reportedly normal. Testing of a nasopharyngeal specimen for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative. Treatment with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan was recommended. During the next 2 days, the fever decreased but did not resolve with the use of acetaminophen. New mild chest discomfort occurred with coughing. An expectorated sputum specimen contained flecks of blood, and the patient returned to the urgent care clinic. The physical examination was unchanged, and rapid antigen testing for influenza types A and B was negative. Additional treatment with ibuprofen, benzonatate, and guaifenesin was recommended. Three days before this admission, the patient had persistent symptoms and was unable to sleep because of the fever and cough. New shortness of breath developed. She was evaluated by a primary care physician at the other hospital in a telehealth visit. Empirical treatment with amoxicillin was started, and close monitoring was recommended. During the next 3 days, the shortness of breath increased in severity, and the patient was instructed to present to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported cough that was worse with exertion and deep breathing, improved with rest, and was associated with pain in the chest and back on the left side. The sputum had streaks of bright red blood. Other symptoms included fatigue, sore throat, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, myalgias, and pain in both knees when walking. The eye redness had resolved, but there was mild soreness of the right eye. There was no headache, ear pain, difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. The patient had a history of developmental dysplasia of the hip and was otherwise healthy. She had normal growth and development and had received all routine childhood vaccinations. Medications included amoxicillin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, benzonatate, guaifenesin, and dextro-methorphan. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was born in New England and lived in a suburban area of New England with her mother, father, and brother. She performed well in high school, which she was attending remotely because of the Covid-19 pandemic; she had no known sick contacts. She had traveled to a Caribbean island 1 year earlier. She was a vegetarian and did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. Her parents and brother were healthy. On examination, the temperature was 38.5C, the heart rate 124 beats per minute, the blood pressure 142/62 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 35.9. The patient appeared pale, and she coughed and sniffled frequently. She did not use accessory muscles while breathing, and breath sounds in the lower lung fields were decreased. There was no conjunctival injection, lymphade-nopathy, joint swelling or tenderness, or rash; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. The creatinine level was 2.00 mg per deciliter 177 mol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter 53 to 133 mol per liter and the C-reactive protein level 77.5 mg per liter reference value, 8.0. The hemoglobin level was 6.7 g per deciliter reference range, 12.0 to 16.0, the hematocrit 21.1 reference range, 36.0 to 46.0, the white-cell count 11,890 per microliter reference range, 4500 to 13,000, and the platelet count 526,000 per microliter reference range, 150,000 to 450,000. Urinalysis revealed 3 blood and 2 protein; microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed more than 100 red cells per high-power field reference range, 0 to 2 and 10 to 20 white cells per high-power field reference value, 10, as well as mixed granular casts and red-cell casts. Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal specimen for SARS-CoV-2, influenza types A and B, and respiratory syncytial virus was negative. An interferon- release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was performed, and blood cultures were obtained. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Randheer Shailam: Chest radiography Fig. 1A and 1B revealed prominent patchy opacities in the lower lung zones. Computed tomography CT of the chest Fig. 1C through 1F, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed peripheral patchy ground-glass opacification with greater involvement of the lower lobes than of the upper lobes, the lingula left lung, and the middle lobe right lung. There were also areas of normal-appearing lung. These findings are not specific and can be seen with infectious causes such as bacterial pneumonia and Covid-19, as well as with noninfectious causes such as aspiration, pulmonary hemorrhage, and less likely, alveolar proteinosis. Dr. Martin: Ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and intravenous fluids were administered. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Granulomatosis with polyangiitis. ", "prediction": "1. **Bacterial pneumonia**: The patient's symptoms of fever, productive cough with bloody sputum, shortness of breath, and the presence of patchy opacities on imaging suggest a bacterial infection even though initial tests were negative.\n2. **Viral pneumonia (other than COVID-19)**: Despite negative tests for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, other viruses might be responsible given the patient's respiratory symptoms and imaging findings.\n3. **Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB)**: Persistent symptoms, hemoptysis, and elevated inflammatory markers warrant consideration of TB, especially given the negative results for common viruses.\n4. **Pulmonary hemorrhage syndromes**: The presence of blood-streaked sputum and ground-glass opacities could indicate a hemorrhagic process in the lung.\n5. **Interstitial lung disease**: Given the CT findings of ground-glass opacities and patient's symptoms, this remains a consideration for a non-infectious etiology.\n6. **Wegener's granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis)**: The combination of hemoptysis, renal involvement (proteinuria and hematuria), and respiratory symptoms may indicate this vasculitic disorder.\n7. **Goodpasture syndrome**: Hemoptysis, renal abnormalities, and lung findings point towards this autoimmune condition affecting both lungs and kidneys.\n8. **Bronchiectasis**: Chronic respiratory infections and hemoptysis could suggest bronchiectasis, which can be confirmed with imaging studies.\n9. **Aspiration pneumonia**: The patient’s condition, worsened by lying down at night, suggests possible aspiration, aligning with patchy opacities seen on CT.\n10. **Pulmonary embolism (with infarction)**: Although less likely, the presence of localized chest pain, hemoptysis, and tachycardia could warrant consideration of a pulmonary embolism with secondary infarction."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Theodore R. Pak Medicine: A 34-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital with hypercortisolism in the context of a metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. The patient had been well until 4 years before this presentation, when abdominal pain, diarrhea, and ascites developed. A pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor with metastases to the liver and spleen was ultimately diagnosed, and treatment with octreotide and everolimus was initiated. Three years before this presentation, treatment with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy was initiated; four cycles were completed over the course of the next 2 years. Eight months before this presentation, the patient decided to stop taking everolimus because of fatigue. Seven months before this presentation, the patient was evaluated at another hospital because of weight gain, hyperglycemia, and changes in mood. She was found to have elevated blood levels of corticotropin and elevated salivary and urinary levels of cortisol. Dr. Adina Haramati: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head revealed a pituitary lesion measuring 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. A specimen of blood obtained from the inferior petrosal sinus identified a pituitary source of cortico-tropin secretion. Dr. Pak: Treatment with octreotide was discontinued, and 3 months before this presentation, transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary lesion was performed. After the surgery, the cortisol and corticotropin levels remained elevated. Repeat MRI of the head revealed a residual pituitary lesion. Transsphenoidal resection of the residual lesion was performed 2 months before this presentation. After the second surgery, the cortisol and corticotropin levels decreased but did not normalize. Pathological evaluation of a resected pituitary specimen revealed normal anterior pituitary architecture that was not consistent with a corticotroph adenoma. At a follow-up appointment in the endocrinology clinic after the patient was discharged, the 24-hour urinary free corti-sol level was again elevated, and treatment with pasireotide was initiated. Ten days before this presentation, the patient began to have confusion, urinary incontinence, and recurrent falls. She was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital. Her husband noted atypical impulsive behaviors, such as online shopping and excessive eating. Dr. Haramati: MRI of the head revealed a small focus of decreased enhancement within the left inferior aspect of the sella turcica, a finding that was consistent with postsurgical changes or residual adenoma. Dr. Pak: A morning blood level of cortisol was 80 g per deciliter 2207 nmol per liter; reference range, 4 to 23 g per deciliter 110 to 635 nmol per liter, and the blood level of corticotropin was 519 pg per milliliter 114 pmol per liter; reference range, 7.2 to 63 pg per milliliter 1.6 to 14 pmol per liter. The 24-hour urinary free cortisol level was 9450 g 26,069 nmol per liter; reference range, 3.5 to 45 g 10 to 124 nmol per liter. Dr. Haramati: MRI of the abdomen revealed an exophytic mass on the pancreatic tail that broadly abutted the left adrenal gland, thickening of both adrenal glands, retroperitoneal metastases on the left side, and extensive hepatic metastases with chronic cavernous transformation of the portal vein. Dr. Pak: Treatment with pasireotide was discontinued, and treatment with ketoconazole was initiated, in addition to potassium supplementation and spironolactone for hypokalemia. On the tenth day at the other hospital, the patient was transferred to this hospital for further treatment. On evaluation at this hospital, the patient reported fatigue but no fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. She had no cough, hemop-tysis, or chest pain; no rheumatologic symptoms; and no history of dysphagia or gastro-esophageal reflux disease. Her medical history included asthma and portal-vein thrombosis complicated by ascites, as well as hypothyroidism and central diabetes insipidus after she had undergone transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary lesions. Medications included atovaquone, cholecalciferol, desmopressin, ketoconazole, levo-thyroxine, metformin, pantoprazole, spironolac-tone, and potassium chloride. She had no known drug allergies. She did not drink alcohol or use tobacco or vaping products; she smoked marijuana occasionally. She lived with her husband in Vermont and had previously worked in a health care facility. The patient reported that she had had several skin tests for Mycobacterium tuberculosis owing to her work in the health care setting, and none had been positive. Before her illness, she had frequently gardened and hiked locally. She had traveled to Canada but otherwise had not traveled outside New England. A paternal aunt had had ovarian cancer. On examination, the temperature was 36.9C, the blood pressure 152/87 mm Hg, the pulse 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 24.0. The patient was alert and oriented and answered questions appropriately. Her face was rounded, and acne and hair thinning were present. The abdomen had increased adiposity and palpable striae. There were several bruises on her arms and legs. A chest radiograph obtained on admission to this hospital showed an implanted venous access device and a patchy opacity in the right upper lung zone. Treatment with octreotide was reinitiated, and treatment with the other medications that the patient had been receiving was continued. The hypercortisolism was thought to be due to secretion of corticotropin from the metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Bilateral adrenalec-tomy was planned, but on the second hospital day, the patient became withdrawn and would not speak, take any oral medications, or consume any food. She was transferred to the intensive care unit, and an etomidate infusion was initiated; the dose was adjusted to attain a blood level of cortisol between 10 and 20 g per deciliter. Subsequent treatment with intravenous lora-zepam resulted in marked improvement in the patients mental status such that she was following commands and responding appropriately to questions. On the sixth hospital day, bilateral adrenalectomy was performed. Treatment with intravenous hydrocortisone was initiated postoperatively, and on the seventh hospital day, the patient was transferred to the medicine unit of this hospital for further care. Dr. Haramati: On the eighth hospital day, sinus tachycardia developed. Computed tomography CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material according to a pulmonary embolism protocol Fig. 1, revealed a patchy consolidation in the right upper lobe with areas of cavitation and adjacent tree-in-bud opacities, as well as small bilateral pleural effusions. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Although previous imaging was not available for review, clinical notes indicated that positron-emission tomographyCT performed at another hospital 8 months before this presentation had revealed a new cavitary nodule in the right upper lobe that measured 7 mm in diameter. Dr. Pak: A sputum culture showed few squamous epithelial cells, rare polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and few mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with no specific type predominating; no acid-fast bacilli were observed on a mycobacterial smear of an induced sputum sample. Urine tests for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens were negative, as was a blood test for cryptococcal antigen. The blood level of 1,3--d-glucan was less than 31 pg per milliliter reference value, 60, and the blood galactomannan index was 0.05 reference range, 0 to 0.49. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. On the ninth hospital day, bronchoscopy was performed; bronchial washings and bronchoal-veolar-lavage BAL samples were obtained, and no purulent secretions were observed. Grams staining of the BAL fluid revealed few mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, and no organisms were seen on an acid-fast bacilli smear or on a modified acid-fast bacilli smear. Examination of the BAL fluid for Pneumocystis jirovecii was negative. On the 11th hospital day, culture of the BAL fluid showed growth of few methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus organisms. Treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and metroni-dazole was initiated. On the 12th hospital day, a urine test for histoplasma antigen was positive, at a level of 2.25 ng per milliliter reference ranges, 0.00 to 0.10 negative; 0.11 to 1.10 indeterminate; 1.11 positive. Management decisions were made, and results of a diagnostic test were received.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Infection with Blastomyces dermatitidis. ", "prediction": "1. **Ectopic ACTH syndrome from metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor**: The patient's hypercortisolism is likely due to excessive secretion of corticotropin by the metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.\n\n2. **Cushing's disease from residual pituitary adenoma**: The persistent elevation of cortisol and ACTH levels after two transsphenoidal surgeries suggests incomplete resection of a corticotroph adenoma.\n\n3. **Adrenal insufficiency post adrenalectomy**: Post bilateral adrenalectomy and persistent hypercortisolism require careful monitoring for adrenal insufficiency, even though she is receiving hydrocortisone replacement therapy.\n\n4. **Histoplasmosis**: The positive urine test for histoplasma antigen indicates a potential infection with Histoplasma capsulatum, especially relevant given her immunocompromised state.\n\n5. **Pulmonary infection by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA)**: MSSA was identified in the BAL fluid and could be contributing to her pulmonary symptoms and cavitary lung lesions.\n\n6. **Cavitary tuberculosis**: Although no acid-fast bacilli were observed, the patient's healthcare background and periodic skin testing for tuberculosis warrant consideration of TB as a possible cause of cavitary lung lesions.\n\n7. **Corticosteroid-induced psychosis**: Her behavioral changes could be explained by severe hypercortisolism, potentially exacerbated by steroid use leading to steroid-induced psychosis.\n\n8. **Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)**: Given her history of weight gain and hyperglycemia, NAFLD could be present, potentially exacerbated by hypercortisolism and treated symptoms.\n\n9. **Hypokalemia due to mineralocorticoid excess**: The patient's hypokalemia is likely related to hypercortisolism and the concurrent use of spironolactone suggests an attempt to mitigate this.\n\n10. **Secondary diabetes mellitus**: It is evident from the patient's history of hyperglycemia and treatment with metformin, most likely secondary to chronic hypercortisolism."}

The patient had been well until 3 hours before this admission, when altered mental status developed while he was at work. During a meeting, his colleagues noticed that he was not paying attention or participating in the conversation, which was atypical of the patient. Instead, he was fidgeting and mumbling as though talking to another person. When his mobile telephone rang, he allowed it to continue ringing. Two hours before this admission, the patient was found by colleagues on the floor of a conference room. His eyes were open, but he was obtunded and making nonpurposeful movements. Emergency medical services were called. On evaluation, a fingerstick glucose measurement was 39 mg per deciliter 2.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 109 mg per deciliter 3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter. Intravenous dextrose was administered, and the patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient was obtunded and did not react to sternal rub. Additional intravenous dextrose was administered, and a dextrose infusion was started. The patients mental status improved, and he was able to provide additional history. That morning, he had felt that he was in a dreamlike state; there were no other symptoms. The altered mental status had resolved, but he could not recall most events of the morning, including the meeting that had taken place 3 hours before admission. Review of symptoms was notable for unintentional weight gain of one pant size during the past 3 months, as well as intermittent morning dizziness during the past 3 years, which would resolve after the patient ate candy or breakfast. He reported no recent illness, depression, anxiety, change in activity or exercise, or change in intake of food or drink. On a typical day, he had breakfast at 5 a.m., a second breakfast at 10 a.m., lunch at 1 p.m., dinner at 6 p.m., and a snack at 8 p.m. The patient had last eaten approximately 7 hours before presentation to the emergency department. Two years earlier, the patient had had an episode of drooping and decreased sensation of the left side of the face and difficulty enunciating words, which occurred while he was at work. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital. The blood glucose level was 64 mg per deciliter 3.6 mmol per liter, and testing for Lyme disease was negative. He received a diagnosis of Bells palsy and was treated with pred-nisone and acyclovir; the symptoms resolved. Two months later, the patient established care in the primary care clinic of this hospital. Routine laboratory testing revealed a blood glucose level of 46 mg per deciliter 2.6 mmol per liter. The patient took vitamin B12 and vitamin D supplements. He took no other medications and had no known drug allergies. He drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. Sixteen years earlier, he had immigrated to the United States from Southeast Asia and now lived alone in an urban area of New England. He worked as a registered nurse. His father and brother had type 2 diabetes and used insulin. On examination, the temperature was 35.7C, the heart rate 82 beats per minute, the blood pressure 146/76 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 27.6. The patient appeared well. He had no hepatosplenomegaly or skin hyperpigmentation, and the remainder of the physical examination was normal. On arrival at the emergency department, the blood glucose level was 36 mg per deciliter 2.0 mmol per liter; after the administration of dextrose, a fingerstick glucose measurement was 158 mg per deciliter 8.8 mmol per liter. The complete blood count and blood electrolyte levels were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The glycated hemoglobin level was 5.4 reference range, 4.3 to 6.4. Serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to this hospital. A diagnostic test was performed.

Factitious hypoglycemia: Given the frequent hypoglycemic episodes and his access to insulin as a nurse, self-administration of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents cannot be ruled out.\n3. Hypoadrenalism (Addison's disease): Recurrent hypoglycemia, weight gain, intermittent dizziness, and a mildly low temperature raise the suspicion of adrenal insufficiency.\n4. Hypopituitarism: Morning dizziness and hypoglycemia, along with the absence of recent illness and a previous episode resembling a vascular event, warrant an evaluation for pituitary dysfunction.\n5. Reactive hypoglycemia: The timing of his symptoms in relation to meals could indicate postprandial hypoglycemia, especially given the rapid resolution after eating.\n6. Non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH): A rare cause, but tumors producing insulin-like growth factor (IGF) can present with spontaneous hypoglycemia and unintentional weight gain.\n7. Medication-induced hypoglycemia: Although he reports no other medications, unintentional or undisclosed intake of drugs like sulfonylureas can cause hypoglycemia.\n8. Autoimmune hypoglycemia: Antibodies against insulin or the insulin receptor leading to hypoglycemia, though uncommon, should be considered in the differential.\n9. Alcohol-related hypoglycemia: Even though he seldom drinks, alcohol can cause hypoglycemia, particularly if not recently consuming food.\n10. Glycogen storage disease: While less likely given his age and history, a late-onset glycogen storage disease could present with fasting hypoglycemia."}

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 days before this admission, when he noticed several itchy white bumps around the anus that subsequently evolved into ulcerative lesions. The next day, he sought evaluation at a primary care clinic of another hospital. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia were performed. An injection of penicillin G benzathine was administered, and treatment with valacyclovir was started. During the next 5 days, the perianal ulcers did not abate, and the patient stopped taking valacyclovir. Painful proctitis with rectal bleeding and malodorous, mucopurulent discharge developed, along with fever, chills, drenching sweats, and new tender swelling in the groin. Three days before this admission, a new painless ulcer appeared on the penis that was similar in appearance to the perianal ulcers. Two days before this admission, new scattered vesicular lesions appeared on the arms and legs, and the patient presented to the infectious disease clinic of this hospital for evaluation. Additional history was obtained from the patient. Fourteen years before this evaluation, sore throat and upper body rash developed; he received a diagnosis of secondary syphilis and was treated with penicillin G benzathine. He also had a history of recurrent oral herpes simplex virus HSV infection, for which he was treated intermittently with valacyclovir. He took daily oral emtricitabine and teno-fovir for HIV preexposure prophylaxis PrEP. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in a suburban area of Massachusetts with two roommates and a cat. Two weeks before this evaluation, he had traveled to an urban area of southeastern Canada. During this trip, he had had sex with male partners without the use of barrier protection. There was no other recent travel. The patient did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he drank alcohol rarely. CME at NEJM.org On examination, the temperature was 36.5C, the blood pressure 130/86 mm Hg, the pulse 75 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 23.9. There were six tender perianal ulcers, measuring less than 1 cm in diameter, with raised, firm margins. There was also one ulcer on the dorsum of the penile shaft, measuring 7 mm in diameter, with raised borders Fig. 1. Painful bilateral inguinal lymphadenopa-thy was present. The perianal skin was weeping, and there was proctitis with severe tenderness that precluded digital rectal examination. In addition, there were approximately 12 papulovesicu-lar lesions scattered across the chest, back, arms, and legs. The lesions measured 2 mm in diameter, were filled with clear fluid, and had surrounding erythema Fig. 2A and 2B. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. A blood test for trepo-nemal antibodies was positive; a rapid plasma reagin RPR test was reactive at a dilution of 1:1. A blood test for HIV was nonreactive, and tests of urine and rectal specimens for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acids were negative. A test of a specimen obtained from a perianal ulcer for HSV nucleic acids was performed, and a blood sample was obtained for bacterial culture. An injection of ceftriaxone was administered, and treatment with valacyclovir and doxycycline was started. During the next 2 days, the ulcers did not abate and the rectal pain worsened, such that the patient was not able to sit, sleep, or have bowel movements. Additional skin lesions appeared. The patient returned to the infectious disease clinic for evaluation. Anoscopy revealed intense rectal and anal inflammation with shallow ulcerations and purulent exudate, findings consistent with proctitis Fig. 3. The patient was admitted to this hospital. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable because of rectal pain. Skin lesions that had become pustular with an erythematous base were scattered across the scalp, chest, back, legs, and arms, including one on the palm Fig. 2C. There were no lesions in the mouth. Multiple tender, enlarged inguinal lymph nodes, measuring more than 1 cm in diameter, were present. The perianal and penile ulcers were tender and had heaped margins around a central dry base. The complete blood count and the white-cell differential count were normal. Swabs from a perianal ulcer and a chest skin lesion were obtained for bacterial culture. Treatment with intravenous acyclovir was started, and doxycycline was continued; stool softeners and hydromorphone were administered. A blood test for HIV type 1 RNA was performed.

Lymphogranuloma Venereum (LGV): The severe proctitis, painful inguinal lymphadenopathy, and ulcerative lesions are suggestive of LGV caused by certain serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis.\n4. HIV Seroconversion Syndrome: Despite a nonreactive HIV test, the patient is on PrEP and had a high-risk exposure; acute HIV seroconversion can present with fever, rash, and mucocutaneous ulcers.\n5. Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) Infection: The widespread vesicular rash along with the patient's immunocompromised status on PrEP might indicate disseminated VZV infection.\n6. Gonococcal Proctitis: Even though initial tests for gonorrhea were negative, a resistant strain or a repeat infection could explain the severe proctitis and rectal pain.\n7. Behcet's Disease: This multisystem inflammatory disorder could manifest with genital ulcers, oral ulcers, and skin lesions similar to those seen in this patient.\n8. Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Chronic ulcers and raised lesion borders may be indicative of malignancy, particularly squamous cell carcinoma, although less likely given the acute presentation.\n9. Allergic Contact Dermatitis: The patient's skin lesions and possible exposure to new substances during his recent travels could suggest a severe allergic reaction.\n10.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Victoria Clark Neurosurgery: A 25-year-old woman with a history of migraines was admitted to this hospital with progressively worsening headaches and photo-phobia during the previous 6 weeks and a 1-week history of nausea, vomiting, and blurred vision. Six weeks before this admission, the patient began to have headaches that were not characteristic of her previous migraines. She described these headaches as discomfort in the middle of her head that was associated with photophobia, phono-phobia, and tinnitus. She reported that she was occasionally awakened from sleep because of headache and that the headache was always present on awakening in the morning. The headache was worse with coughing and abated with standing; treatment with ibuprofen did not reduce the discomfort. One week before admission, nausea and vomiting developed, along with blurred vision when the patient looked to the left. She also reported occasional episodes of total vision loss that lasted for several seconds. When she was unable to eat food because of worsening nausea and vomiting, she presented to another hospital for evaluation. Computed tomography CT of the head revealed dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles with hypodensity that involved the dorsal brain stem and cerebellar hemispheres Fig. 1A; a possible soft-tissue mass in the region of the fourth ventricular outlet was also observed. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. On arrival, the patient reported ongoing headache and nausea. Other medical history included obesity and opioid use disorder, which was treated with oral bu-prenorphinenaloxone and was complicated by relapses with injection of heroin; she last injected heroin 1 month before admission. Other medications included ibuprofen as needed. She had no known allergies. She smoked a half pack of cigarettes daily and did not drink alcohol. The patient lived in a wooded area of New England with four cats and one dog. She spent time outside, although she had become less active owing to headache. She was sexually active with one male partner and had no history of sexually transmitted infections. She had not traveled outside of New England. She had had periods of homelessness in the past, but she had not stayed in shelters. She had been incarcerated 2 years before this admission. She did not eat uncooked meat or seafood. Two paternal family members had had ovarian cancer. On examination, the patient was alert, interactive, and did not appear to be in distress. The temperature was 36.9°C, the blood pressure 117//58 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 42.6. There were track marks on the legs. The patient was oriented to time, place, and person. Speech was fluent with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. On bedside visual field testing, she reported decreased vision in the peripheral fields and double vision on looking to the far left, which was accompanied by a left sixth-nerve palsy; papilledema was present in both eyes. The remainder of the cranial-nerve examination was normal. Tests of motor strength and sensation were normal. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the complete blood count and differential count and the results of liver- and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Saurabh Rohatgi: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed elevated signal hyperintensity involving the periaqueductal gray matter, dorsal midbrain, dorsal pons, superior and middle cerebellar peduncles, dentate nuclei, and cerebellar white matter (Figure 1B). There was obstructive hydrocephalus with transependymal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Leptomeningeal enhancement was observed surrounding the brain stem and extending through the inferior aspect of the posterior fossa with entrapment of the fourth ventricle (Figure 1C). There was also leptomeningeal enhancement along multiple upper and lower cranial nerves. Dr. Clark: Treatment with intravenous acetazolamide and oral dexamethasone was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the neurocritical care unit. On the first hospital day, the patient underwent stereotactically guided endoscopic exploration of the right ventricle. The right foramen of Monro was patent, but there was obstruction in the underlying third ventricle due to adhesions and aberrant anatomical features that precluded endoscopic third ventriculostomy. An external ventricular drain was placed; the opening pressure was 10 cm of water. Analysis of a CSF specimen obtained from the external ventricular drain showed 2 white cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), of which 90% were neutrophils and 10% were monocytes, and 768 red cells per microliter (reference value, 0); the CSF levels of protein and glucose were normal. Dexamethasone therapy was discontinued, and treatment with intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone was initiated. Airborne precautions were instituted, and an induced sputum sample was obtained for mycobacterial culture. No acid-fast bacilli were observed on examination of smears of three sputum samples obtained sequentially, and polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing of one of the samples for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. CSF cultures were negative, and cytologic examination of the CSF did not show malignant cells. Dr. Rohatgi: On the third hospital day, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. On the fourth hospital day, MRI of the spine revealed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement, most notably in the lumbar spine, with masslike confluent enhancement filling the subarachnoid space at L5–S2 (Figure 1F). Dr. Clark: On the fifth hospital day, a lumbar puncture was performed; the CSF analysis revealed 1120 nucleated cells, of which 77% were neutrophils, and 23 red cells. The CSF protein level was 740 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55) and the glucose level 19 mg per deciliter (1.1 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]). The opening pressure was 10 cm of water relative to the external auditory meatus, which was the same as the pressure that was simultaneously recorded from the clamped external ventricular drain. CSF was sent for culture and cytologic studies. A diagnostic test result was received. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Chronic Candida albicans meningitis. ", "prediction": "1. Central Nervous System (CNS) Neoplasm: The progressive nature of the headaches, papilledema, hydrocephalus, and leptomeningeal enhancement suggest the presence of a CNS tumor, such as glioma or metastatic disease.\n2. Tuberculous Meningitis: The chronic headaches, photophobia, cranial nerve involvement, and leptomeningeal enhancement raise the possibility of tuberculous meningitis, even though initial PCR testing was negative.\n3. Cryptococcal Meningitis: Given the obesity and opioid use disorder, the patient could be immunocompromised, and the symptoms of headaches, photophobia, and CSF abnormalities are consistent with cryptococcal meningitis.\n4. Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV): The presence of cats and woodland exposure raises the possibility of LCMV, presenting with similar neurological findings and leptomeningeal enhancement.\n5. Lyme Neuroborreliosis: The patient's outdoor exposure in New England and symptoms of headache, photophobia, and cranial nerve involvement suggest Lyme disease affecting the central nervous system.\n6. Sarcoidosis: The radiological finding and broad spectrum of neurological symptoms can indicate neurosarcoidosis, especially with leptomeningeal enhancement and hydrocephalus.\n7. Fungal Meningoencephalitis: Chronic headaches, leptomeningeal enhancement, and CNS involvement suggest a possible fungal infection, such as histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis.\n8. Carcinomatous Meningitis: Her two paternal family members with ovarian cancer increase the suspicion for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, manifesting with hydrocephalus and leptomeningeal spread.\n9. Viral Meningoencephalitis: Given the subacute onset and vomiting, a viral cause such as HSV or enterovirus could be responsible for the patient's symptoms.\n10. Autoimmune Encephalitis: The involvement of multiple cranial nerves, subacute progression, and normal systemic workup could indicate an underlying autoimmune process, like anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis."}

Gumuser Medicine: A 48-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of multiple lung and liver lesions identified during an evaluation for abdominal pain. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 10 days before this admission, when burning epigastric pain developed after she ate a meal. Nausea and vomiting occurred 1 hour later; there was no diarrhea. After the pain persisted for 8 hours, she presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 36.8C, the blood pressure 136/94 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 25.8. The abdomen was soft but distended; there was diffuse mild tenderness on palpation, without rebound or guarding. The white-cell count was 12,800 per micro-liter reference range, 4500 to 11,000 and the blood lipase level 147 U per liter reference range, 13 to 60; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The pain did not resolve after treatment with intravenous famotidine and oral simethicone. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Melissa C. Price: A chest radiograph showed faint nodular opacities in the lungs, predominantly in the upper lobes. Computed tomography CT of the abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple fluid-filled small-bowel loops with associated mild mesenteric edema and trace ascites. There was no biliary dilatation. In addition, there were numerous hypoattenuating hepatic lesions with peripheral enhancement. Dr. Gumuser: The patient was admitted to the other hospital with a diagnosis of possible small-bowel obstruction and pneumonia. Treatment with intravenous fluids and ceftriaxone, oral doxycycline, and bowel rest was initiated. On the second hospital day, additional imaging studies of the liver were obtained. Dr. Price: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the abdomen Fig. 1, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilobar hepatic lesions with peripheral enhancement, high T2 signal, and diffusion restriction. Dr. Gumuser: Blood was obtained for microbio-logic culture, and treatment with intravenous metronidazole was initiated. On the third hospital day, the abdominal pain had resolved, and the patient began drinking clear fluids. On the fourth hospital day, ultrasound-guided liver biopsy was performed. While the results of the liver biopsy were pending, the patient resumed a normal diet, with no recurrence of abdominal pain. Treatment with oral doxycycline and intravenous ceftriax-one and metronidazole was continued. Dr. Price: On the sixth hospital day, CT of the chest Fig. 1, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed numerous irregular cysts and cavitary nodules in the lungs, which were most pronounced in the upper lobes, as well as solid and subsolid paren-chymal nodules that measured less than 1.0 cm in diameter. There were multiple nodules in the thyroid gland, measuring up to 2.8 cm in diameter in the inferior left thyroid lobe. There was a 1.7-cm nodule with soft-tissue attenuation in the right breast. Dr. Gumuser: On the eighth hospital day, bron-choscopy was performed. The airways were inspected to the segmental level, and no abnormalities were visualized. Transbronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage BAL were performed in the right upper lobe. Examination of the BAL fluid revealed 321 white cells per microliter reference range, 94 to 175. Grams staining and examination of an acid-fast bacilli smear of the BAL fluid were negative. On the ninth hospital day, results of the liver biopsy became available, showing extensive eo-sinophilic infiltration of the liver parenchyma with associated moderate steatosis. Staining of the biopsy specimen for microorganisms, including mycobacteria, was negative. Cultures of blood obtained on the second hospital day showed no growth. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further care. On arrival, the patient reported a mild sore throat that had developed after bronchoscopy, but there was no abdominal pain. She had lost 2 kg of weight before the hospitalization, in the context of dietary changes. She had no history of fever but reported a several-year history of mild shortness of breath with walking that she attributed to smoking. Her surgical history included cholecystectomy and cesarean section. Results of a Papanicolaou test performed 3 months before this presentation had been normal; the patient had not undergone mammography or colonoscopy. She took no medications and had no known drug allergies. The patient lived in an urban area of New England. She was born in Portugal and had immigrated to the United States 40 years earlier. She had not traveled recently; her last trip had been to Portugal 25 years before this admission. The patient was divorced, lived alone, and worked in a medical laboratory. She had no known exposure to chemicals or dust; a coworker at a previous office job had had an atypical infection attributed to mold in the workplace. She had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 30 years. She drank alcohol three times a week and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had died from colon cancer at 43 years of age. On examination, the temperature was 36.2C, the blood pressure 130/64 mm Hg, the pulse 65 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was normal. A diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Langerhans-cell histiocytosis of the lung and liver. ", "prediction": "1. Parasitic Infection (Strongyloidiasis): Considering the eosinophilic infiltration found in the liver and patient's history of living in an area where exposure is possible, a parasitic infection such as strongyloidiasis is highly likely.\n2. Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis: The patient’s exposure to potential mold in past workplaces and her smoking history could suggest hypersensitivity pneumonitis, especially with the presence of lung nodules and cavitary lesions.\n3. Metastatic Cancer: The presence of multiple lung, liver, thyroid, and breast masses raises concern for metastatic malignancy, possibly from a primary breast or lung carcinoma.\n4. Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA): This is a viable differential due to the eosinophilic infiltration in the liver and clinical signs that parallel systemic involvement consistent with EGPA.\n5. Tuberculosis: Despite negative AFB smears, the lung cavitary lesions and the patient's previous exposure to atypical infections suggest tuberculosis remains a possibility, particularly latent TB reactivation.\n6. Fungal Infection (Histoplasmosis or Coccidioidomycosis): Given the patient’s clinical presentation and negative bacterial cultures, a fungal infection such as histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis should be considered.\n7. Sarcoidosis: The presence of pulmonary nodules, liver lesions and absence of clear infectious etiology might suggest sarcoidosis, which commonly affects multiple organ systems.\n8. Autoimmune Hepatitis: Eosinophilic infiltration in the liver could indicate autoimmune hepatitis, a diagnosis which warrants consideration given the systemic nature of the symptoms.\n9. Hepatic Abscess: Given the peripheral enhancement of the hepatic lesions and gastrointestinal symptoms, a hepatic abscess from bacterial etiology is a potential differential.\n10. Lymphoma: The systemic distribution of lesions, including the lungs, liver, and breast, can also be seen in lymphoma, thus should be taken into account especially if simpler infectious etiologies are ruled out."}

Suarez Neurology: A 32-year-old man was admitted to this hospital after 2 weeks of confusion and headache and 2 days of fever. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 1 month before admission, when his wife noted that he began to have behavior suggestive of anxiety. Two weeks before admission, his wife noted that he began to have confusion; for example, he was unable to recall the ages of his children or to correctly identify the date. At that time, headache and neck stiffness developed. Two days before admission, fever developed. On the day of admission, the patient had worsening confusion and somnolence, and his wife brought him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On presentation, the patient was not able to provide any history but was accompanied by his wife, who described his recent symptoms. His medical record showed a 10-year history of Behcets disease, which had initially been complicated by oral and genital ulcers and intermittent fever. During the following decade, flares of Behcets disease had been associated with various manifestations: pulmonary embolism, iliac artery aneurysm and dissection, bilateral renal vein thrombosis, erythema nodosum, deep venous thrombosis, uveitis, an inferior vena cava clot complicated by superior vena cava syndrome that led to thrombectomy, and renal infarction. The flares of Behcets disease had usually included oral ulcers, genital ulcers, uveitis, or fever. Past treatment for Behcets disease had included azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone. Two years before this presentation, treatment with azathioprine and cyclosporine was discontinued and adalimumab initiated. Attempts to taper the dose of prednisone resulted in flares of genital and oral ulcers. The frequency of adalimumab administration was increased to weekly, but genital and oral ulcers persisted. Thirteen months before this presentation, treatment with adalimumab was stopped and infliximab initiated. Diffuse arthralgias developed that were attributed to infliximab. Twelve months before this presentation, treatment with infliximab was stopped and golimumab initiated. CME at NEJM.org Other medical history included an episode of lymphocyte-predominant meningitis, which had been diagnosed during an evaluation for headache, fever, and neck pain 17 months before this presentation. During the episode, there was a 72-hour delay in performing lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid CSF analysis because the patient had been taking apixaban for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. While he was awaiting lumbar puncture, broad-spectrum antibiotic agents were administered, and the headache, fever, and neck pain resolved. CSF analysis revealed normal levels of glucose and total protein, no red cells, and a nucleated-cell count of 88 per microliter reference range, 0 to 5, with 97 lymphocytes and 3 monocytes. Nucleic acid amplification testing for herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 DNA was negative, and Grams staining revealed no organisms. Antimicrobial therapy was discontinued, and the patient was discharged home. There was also a history of coronavirus disease 2019, which had been diagnosed 16 months before this presentation. Current medications included golimumab, apixaban, prednisone, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. There were no known allergies. The patient lived with his wife and four children. He had previously worked in construction; he had been released from prison 3 months before this presentation and was not currently working. He had a remote history of smoking tobacco; he did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. His grandmother had hypertension. On examination in the emergency department, the patient was somnolent but arose in response to verbal stimuli. His level of alertness fluctuated, he was only intermittently able to answer simple questions, and he could not provide a coherent history of his illness. The temperature was 39.5C, the blood pressure 122/71 mm Hg, the heart rate 81 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while he was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 29.7. He was oriented to person and place but not to time. There was no neck stiffness. Mild injection in the left eye was present, but there were no oral or skin lesions. The patient was not able to participate fully in a neuro-logic examination, but he was able to move his arms and legs; no focal neurologic findings were noted on observation. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were results of liver-function, kidney-function, and coagulation tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones but was otherwise normal. The blood acetaminophen level was less than 5.0 g per milliliter reference range, 0.0 to 25.0; blood testing for ethanol was negative. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab specimen for respiratory viral pathogens was positive for human rhinovirus or enterovirus. Blood specimens were obtained for culture. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Pamela W. Schaefer: A chest radiograph was normal. Computed tomography CT of the head revealed mucosal thickening with layering fluid levels in both maxillary sinuses, but the study was otherwise normal. CT angiography of the head and neck, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed normal arterial and venous vasculature. Dr. Suarez: Treatment with vancomycin, ceftri-axone, ampicillin, and acyclovir was initiated. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Treatment with apixaban was stopped and heparin administered intravenously in anticipation of performing a lumbar puncture. Fever and headache abated, but the patients mental status did not improve. Blood cultures showed no growth. On the fourth hospital day, a lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was not obtained. CSF analysis revealed a normal total protein level, a glucose level of 40 mg per deciliter 2.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter 2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter, a red-cell count of 2 per microliter reference range, 0 to 5, and a nucleated-cell count of 284 per microliter reference range, 0 to 5, with 72 lymphocytes, 13 neutrophils, 11 monocytes, and 4 unclassified cells. Nucleic acid amplification testing for herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 DNA was negative, and Grams staining revealed no organisms. No acid-fast bacilli were observed on a mycobacterial smear, and no fungi were seen on examination of a fungal wet preparation. Testing of the CSF for cryptococcal antigen and enterovirus RNA was negative. Additional diagnostic testing was performed, and a diagnosis was made.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: CME at NEJM.org Dr. John H. Stone: A 59-year-old man was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of headache and progressive neurologic dysfunction. Ten months before this evaluation, daily fever with a temperature of up to 38.9C, chills, myalgias, drenching night sweats, and pressure and pain in both cheeks and ears developed. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. He reported rhinorrhea and fatigue but no headache, pharyngitis, or dyspnea, and he had no sick contacts. On examination, the temperature was 37.8C, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 112/64 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98 while he was breathing ambient air. He was ill-appearing, and the maxillary sinuses were tender on palpation; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The platelet count was 463,000 per microliter reference range, 140,000 to 400,000; the remainder of the complete blood count and the differential count were normal. Amoxicillinclavulanate was prescribed. During the next 2 weeks, fever, night sweats, and sinus and facial pain continued. Diffuse headache developed, along with jaw soreness, scalp tenderness, and hip and shoulder stiffness. The patient was evaluated again by his primary care physician. He reported weight loss of 2 kg, episodic double vision, and hip pain that caused difficulty in standing and climbing stairs. The physical examination was unchanged. Urinalysis was normal. A test for heterophile antibody and an interferon- release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative, as were screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus and Lyme disease. Chest radiography and computed tomography of the sinuses were normal. The patient was referred to a rheumatologist at another hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported persistent fever and frontal, temporal, and maxillary headache. There were palpable temporal artery pulses without tender-ness; the remainder of the examination was normal, including the absence of bruits on auscultation of large vessels. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 108 mm per hour reference range, 0 to 20, the blood level of C-reactive protein greater than 100 mg per liter reference value, 8.0, the blood level of rheumatoid factor 24 IU per milliliter reference value, 14, and the blood level of aldolase 8.4 IU per milliliter reference value, 8.1. Biopsy of the right temporal artery was performed. Histologic examination of the biopsy specimen reportedly showed no granulomas, but evidence of chronic inflammation of the temporal artery and fibrinoid necrosis of an adjacent small vessel were noted. A diagnosis of giant-cell arteritis was made, and treatment with prednisone was started. Within a few days after initiation of treatment, headache, fever, jaw pain, and joint stiffness abated. The next month, an attempt to lower the predni-sone dose resulted in recurrent severe headache with scalp tenderness, jaw pain, and hip stiffness. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 55 mm per hour and the C-reactive protein level 84 mg per liter. Treatment with weekly subcutaneous administration of tocilizumab was initiated. During the next 6 weeks, another attempt was made to taper the prednisone dose. After 1 week of treatment at a lower prednisone dose, and 5 months after the development of initial symptoms 5 months before the current evaluation, the patient reported headache that he described as the worst headache of my life, with associated jaw pain and diplopia. The pain was worst at the right frontal and maxillary areas, but the entire right side of the face, including the scalp and neck, was affected. The patient returned to the other hospital for evaluation. He was found to have palsies of the third and sixth cranial nerves on the right side. The patient was admitted to the neurology service at the other hospital. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ANCA testing revealed a slightly elevated myeloperoxi-dase antibody level, at 1.9 U reference value, 1.0, but antibodies to proteinase 3 were not detected. Blood levels of IgG subclasses were normal. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Otto Rapalino: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head Fig. 1A and 1B, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed abnormal expansion and en-hancement of the right cavernous sinus that extended into the right superior orbital fissure and right pterygopalatine fossa, as well as abnormal pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement of the adjacent right middle cranial fossa. MRI of the cervical spine Fig. 1C and 1D showed mass-like pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement in the upper cervical spinal canal at C2C4 with an anterior predominance as well as more circumferentially at the cervicothoracic junction C6T3 with a posterior predominance, with resultant canal narrowing and mild cord compression at C7T2. There was no spinal cord edema. Dr. John Stone: A lumbar puncture was performed; an opening pressure was not recorded. The cerebrospinal fluid CSF glucose level was 65 mg per deciliter 3.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 80 mg per deciliter 2.8 to 4.4 mmol per liter, and the protein level was 126 mg per deciliter reference range, 15 to 45, with 2 red cells per microliter and 8 white cells per micro-liter of which 79 were lymphocytes. Grams staining and cultures of the CSF were negative. Tests for CSF myelin basic protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme, cryptococcal antigen, cysti-cercosis IgG, mycobacterial DNA, EpsteinBarr virus DNA, and borrelia DNA were negative, as was a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test. Cytologic analysis of the CSF showed a mixed population of mononuclear cells with rare plasma cells. The CSF immunoglobulin level was 19 mg per deciliter reference range, 0 to 6, with 5 oligo-clonal bands. On the eighth hospital day, a meningeal biopsy was performed. Treatment with high-dose prednisone was started, and the patient was discharged home. During the next 2 weeks, the patient continued taking the prednisone, but the facial and head pain worsened. He was readmitted to the other hospital to receive 3 days of treatment with parenteral pulse-dose methyl-prednisolone. Pathological examination of the meningeal biopsy specimen revealed a densely fibrotic, chronically inflamed dura mater with large numbers of CD68 macrophages and CD3 T lymphocytes and with focal collections of CD20 B lymphocytes. There was a large number of poly-clonal plasma cells with more than 100 IgG4 plasma cells per high-power field. Storiform fi-brosis was present, and elastin staining revealed obliterative venulitis. Some of the inflammatory foci were angiocentric, but no vasculitis was present. There were rare foci of fibrinoid necrosis and some neutrophils, with rare giant cells but no granulomas. A diagnosis of IgG4-related disease was made, and rituximab was administered. Two days after the first rituximab dose, a pulmonary embolism was diagnosed, and treat-ment with apixaban was initiated. Two weeks later, repeat imaging was obtained to evaluate the treatment response. Dr. Rapalino: Repeat MRI of the head Fig. 2A and 2B, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed increased abnormal enhancement in the right cavernous sinus and right middle cranial fossa and new abnormal enhancement in the left cavernous sinus and adjacent left middle cranial fossa. MRI of the cervical spine Fig. 2C and 2D also showed progression in the extent and thickness of the ventral and dorsal pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement. There was also progression of the canal stenosis, which had become severe, and cord compression at the C7 level. There was no cord signal abnormality. fusion of rituximab, as well as treatment with oral dexamethasone. Three weeks later, and 7 months after the development of initial symptoms 3 months before the current evaluation, the patient was admitted to the other hospital because of worsening headache, nausea, and vomiting. Examination was notable for new sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear and deviation of the tongue to the left. A ventriculoperitoneal shuntDr. John Stone: The patient received a second in-was placed. Treatment with dexamethasone was continued, and the patient was discharged home. Three weeks after placement of the ventriculo-peritoneal shunt, the patient was admitted again to the other hospital because of streptococcal infection. Two months after discharge, and 10 months after the development of initial symptoms, he was seen in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital for additional evaluation. The patient had a history of migraines, hypertension, and a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation. Medications included apixaban, ba-clofen, dexamethasone, furosemide, gabapentin, lisinopril, and metoprolol. He was a retired businessman and lived with his wife. He drank one glass of wine weekly and had quit smoking more than 40 years before the current evaluation. His maternal grandfather had died from a ruptured aortic aneurysm. The temperature was 36.5C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 118/79 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 25.8. The scalp hair was thin. He had cushingoid facies; acne on the face, back, and chest; striae on the flanks; and proximal muscle weakness of the arms and legs. There was no scalp or temporal tenderness. He had no tongue lesions or oral ulcers, and the nasal examination showed no crusting. Extra-ocular movements were intact. There was no arthritis. The chest, abdominal, and neurologic examinations were normal. The complete blood count and the differential count were normal, as was a urinalysis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 52 mm per hour and the C-reactive protein level 5 mg per liter. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed an IgM level of 22 mg per deciliter reference range, 53 to 334 and normal levels of IgG and IgA. ANCA testing was negative.

Diarrhea had initially developed in the patient during infancy. When the patient was 2 months of age, he had poor growth and frequent bowel movements with loose stools. When he began to eat solid foods, diarrhea continued, and a hydrolyzed-protein diet was started. His parents were instructed to remove dairy, soy, and gluten from his diet, but diarrhea did not abate. Allergy skin-prick testing with cows milk and soy antigens was negative. When the patient was 10 months of age, failure to thrive and diarrhea persisted, and generalized edema and nephrotic syndrome developed. Esophagogas-troduodenoscopy EGD was performed, and histopathological examination of a small-intestinal biopsy specimen reportedly revealed villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and diffuse inflammation. Transmission electron microscopy reportedly showed mild degenerative changes of the surface epithelium and mild focal micro-villous atrophy; there were no immune deposits, and the basement membrane was normal. Renal biopsy was also performed, and histopathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen revealed glomeruli with diffuse thickening of the basement membrane; there was no proliferation of cells or mesangial matrix. Transmission electron microscopy showed total effacement of the epithelial cell foot processes and an irregularly thickened glomerular basement membrane with numerous subepi-thelial and intramembranous electron-dense deposits. The patient received a working diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome due to membranous glomerulonephritis, and treatment with prednisone was started. Diarrhea abated, proteinuria and generalized edema resolved, and growth resumed. However, during the next 2 years, intermittent relapses of diarrhea and nephrotic syndrome occurred when the dose of prednisone was decreased. When the patient was 3 years of age, treatment with chlorambucil was started for recurrent membranous glomerulonephritis, and there were no relapses for 1 year. When the patient was 4 years of age, there was a recurrence of diarrhea associated with fever and hemolytic anemia. Stool culture, stool testing for Clostridioides difficile toxin, and examination of the stool for ova and parasites were all negative. EGD was performed, and histopatho-logical examination of a small-intestinal biopsy specimen reportedly revealed villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and active enteritis. The blood IgE level was 501 IU per milliliter reference range, 0 to 100. The blood level of endomysial antibodies was not elevated, but antiepithelial cell antibodies were detected. The patient received a diagnosis of autoimmune enteropathy, and treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids and cyclosporine was begun. After several months, treatment with gluco-corticoids and cyclosporine was stopped, and tacrolimus was begun. Tacrolimus was stopped after several years, when the patients symptoms resolved. From 5 to 13 years of age, he had no enteropathy, anemia, or nephropathy. Beginning at 13 years of age, the patient was hospitalized for recurrences of diarrhea and ne-phropathy every 2 to 4 years during the 20 years before this evaluation. Six years before this evaluation, EGD and colonoscopy were performed, and the duodenal and colonic mucosa appeared diffusely edematous. Biopsy specimens were obtained. Dr. Stuti G. Shroff: Examination of a duodenal biopsy specimen Fig. 1 revealed marked villous blunting, an increase in lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria known as lymphoplasmacytic expansion of the lamina propria, and a patchy increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes. Examination of a colonic biopsy specimen revealed mild focal active colitis that spared the rectum. Dr. Hatipoglu: Treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was begun, and diarrhea abated. For the next 2 years, relapses of diarrhea and nephrotic syndrome were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone or oral prednisone in combination with cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Four years before this evaluation, antibodies against the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor were not detected. Renal biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen again revealed evidence of membranous glomerulonephritis. Treatment was changed to prednisone, budesonide, and abata-cept, and symptoms abated. After 2 years, the patient stopped taking abatacept. After another 2 years, diarrhea recurred, and the patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. In the gastroenterology clinic, additional history was obtained. There was a history of hypertension, gallstones, and rosacea. Eczema had developed when the patient was 10 months of age and had occurred intermittently into adulthood; it had abated with the administration of immunosuppressive agents. Anaphylactic shock had occurred when the patient was 2 years of age after he had been exposed to uncooked egg. At that time, allergy testing was performed, and the patients parents were instructed to remove eggs, tree nuts, peanuts, fish, and shellfish from his diet, in addition to removing dairy, soy, and gluten. Current medications included prednisone, budesonide, and losartan. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in a Mid-Atlantic state and worked as a salesperson. He did not smoke tobacco and drank beer rarely. His family history included ovarian cancer in his mother and skin cancer in his father; his brother was healthy. On examination, the temperature was 37.0C, the blood pressure 131/94 mm Hg, the heart rate 106 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 24.1. The patient had short stature and diffuse erythema of the face and neck. There was mild tenderness in the left lower abdomen. The results of a lactulose breath test were normal, as was the fecal calprotectin level. Testing for antibodies to tissue transglutamin-ase was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. EGD and colonoscopy were performed, and the findings were consistent with duodenitis, gastritis, and atrophy of the colon. Biopsy specimens were obtained. Dr. Shroff: Histopathological examination of ileal and duodenal biopsy specimens Fig. 1 revealed villous blunting, lymphoplasmacytic expansion of the lamina propria, and intraepithe-lial lymphocytosis.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Numa P. Perez Surgery: A newborn girl was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit ICU of this hospital because of hypoglycemia. The patients mother was a 27-year-old woman gravida 1, para 1 who had received prenatal care at another hospital. At 34 weeks of gestation, an ultrasono-graphic survey of the fetal anatomy had reportedly revealed an avascular intraab-dominal cystic mass that was located near the bladder and measured 3.7 cm by 2.1 cm by 2.0 cm. A sacral dimple was noted. The patients mother was referred to the maternalfetal medicine clinic of the other hospital; she declined follow-up imaging and amniocentesis. At 37 weeks 6 days of gestation, premature labor occurred, and the patients mother was taken to a second hospital. A fetal heart tracing was noted to be nonreactive with minimal variability. The fetal biophysical profile score was 4 out of 8, indicating decreased breathing motion and body movement but normal tone and amniotic fluid volume. An emergency cesarean section was performed. On delivery, the newborn had limp tone and poor respiratory effort. The birth weight was 2963 g 19th percentile, the length 48 cm 20th percentile, and the head circumference 35 cm 77th percentile. The Apgar scores at 1 minute and 5 minutes were 7 and 9, respectively. The patient was transferred to the newborn nursery. In the nursery, the patient was noted to be jittery. Oxygen therapy was administered through a low-flow nasal cannula. The blood glucose level was reportedly less than 10 mg per deciliter 0.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter 3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter and the bilirubin level 16.0 mg per deciliter 274 mol per liter; reference range, 2.0 to 15.0 mg per deciliter 34 to 257 mol per liter. A chest radiograph showed a normal cardiac shadow and findings indicative of retained fetal lung fluid. The newborn was fed, and a bolus of dextrose was administered; however, a repeat blood glucose level was 2 mg per deciliter 0.1 mmol per liter. A continuous infusion of dextrose was started. Phototherapy and empirical treatment with ampicillin and gentamicin were administered. During the next 3 days, the patients blood glucose level remained low, with a maximum level of 61 mg per deciliter 3.4 mmol per liter, even though the glucose infusion rate was increased and enteral feeding with formula was initiated. On the fourth day of life, she was transferred to the neonatal ICU of this hospital for further treatment. On admission to the neonatal ICU, additional history was obtained. Before the ultrasono-graphic survey at 34 weeks of gestation, the pregnancy had been normal. The patients mother had taken prenatal vitamins. Prenatal maternal screening had been negative for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis, as well as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and group B streptococcal infections; there was evidence of immunity to rubella virus. The maternal ABO blood type was AB, Rh positive. The newborns parents had immigrated to the United States from the Caribbean and now lived in a suburb in New England. The patients mother, father, and half brother were healthy. On examination, the patient was alert and appeared comfortable. The temperature was 36.9C, the heart rate 148 beats per minute, the blood pressure 79/45 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 49 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while she was breathing ambient air. The anterior and posterior fontanelles were flat and soft. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The abdomen was soft without distention, tenderness, or palpable masses. Two sacral dimples with visible bases were noted. The female genitalia appeared normal, but the anus was displaced anteriorly. The blood glucose level was 60 mg per deciliter 3.3 mmol per liter while the patient was receiving dextrose at a glucose infusion rate of 10.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per minute. The total bilirubin level was 20.4 mg per deciliter 349 mol per liter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Sjirk J. Westra: A chest radiograph showed clear lungs. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasonogra-phy Fig. 1 revealed a large solidcystic mass anterior to the sacrum that measured 2.7 cm by 3.0 cm by 5.7 cm, with the rectum passing anteriorly to the mass. Results of spinal ultrasonog-raphy were normal, as were results of cranial ultrasonography performed through the anterior fontanelle. In addition, magnetic resonance im-aging MRI of the abdomen, pelvis, and spine Fig. 2 showed a presacral solidcystic mass that measured 2.7 cm by 2.8 cm by 5.9 cm, with a small extension into the ischiorectal fossa on the right side. There was no evidence of abdominal lymphadenopathy or involvement of the sacral spine. Dr. Perez: During the next few days, the patient continued to receive dextrose at a high glucose infusion rate to maintain normoglycemia. At 5 days of life, a small bowel movement occurred. The blood lactate dehydrogenase level was 1173 U per liter reference range, 110 to 210 and the beta human chorionic gonadotropin level 10.7 mIU per milliliter reference range, 1.1. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Neonatal hypoglycemia due to biologically active teratoma and the Sotos syndrome. ", "prediction": "1. Congenital Hyperinsulinism: Persistent hypoglycemia despite high rates of glucose infusion indicates possible hyperinsulinism, commonly seen in newborns.\n\n2. Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome: Hypoglycemia, an avascular abdominal mass, and elevated beta-hCG levels can be associated with this overgrowth disorder.\n\n3. Sacrococcygeal Teratoma: The presacral mass detected on ultrasound and MRI is consistent with a teratoma, a common tumor in neonates presenting with cystic and solid components.\n\n4. Neonatal Sepsis: The administration of empirical antibiotics and initial symptoms such as poor respiratory effort and jitteriness suggest an underlying infectious process.\n\n5. Prader-Willi Syndrome: Hypotonia, hypoglycemia, and the patient's specific physical features fit the potential diagnosis of this genetic disorder.\n\n6. Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia: Low glucose levels and the presence of an anteriorly displaced anus are characteristic findings in some forms of CAH.\n\n7. Inborn Errors of Metabolism: Persistent hypoglycemia unresponsive to routine management raises the possibility of metabolic disorders such as glycogen storage diseases.\n\n8. Hepatoblastoma: Elevated bilirubin and the presence of an abdominal mass could signify a liver tumor like hepatoblastoma.\n\n9. Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn (PPHN): Clear lung fields but initial poor respiratory effort warrant consideration of PPHN, especially given the initial need for oxygen.\n\n10.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Yousef R. Badran: A 72-year-old man was transferred to this hospital because of heartburn, nausea, and the inability to eat solid and liquid food. The patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The symptoms had been well controlled with the use of daily omeprazole therapy until 11 months before this admission, when heartburn recurred despite treatment. At that time, the patient also noticed nausea after eating and early satiation. During the next 9 months, the heartburn and nausea slowly increased in severity. To help manage his symptoms, the patient adjusted his diet from solid food to soft solid food. Two months before this admission, the patient sought evaluation at the gastro-enterology clinic of another hospital. The glycated hemoglobin level was 6.1 reference range, 4.3 to 5.6. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy EGD was performed. Although the patient had not eaten food for 24 hours before the procedure, the stomach could not be adequately visualized because there was a large amount of residual food; no intraluminal masses were seen. A scintigraphy study of gastric emptying was performed. During the study, 88 of the gastric contents were retained at 1 hour, 88 at 2 hours, 81 at 3 hours, and 80 at 4 hours. In a patient with normal gastric emptying, less than 60 of the gastric contents would be retained at 2 hours and less than 10 at 4 hours. Thus, the results were consistent with severely delayed gastric emptying. The patient was told that he had idiopathic gastroparesis and underwent trials of several medications. Ondansetron caused constipation, erythromycin caused burning while swallowing and abdominal cramping, and metoclopramide and scopolamine did not lead to a decrease in the patients symptoms. During the 2 months after the evaluation in the gastroenterology clinic, the patient adjusted his diet from soft solid food to blended solid food. Two weeks before this admission, he adjusted his diet to primarily liquid food, such as nutritional supplement drinks, protein shakes, and ice cream. When the patient was no longer able to drink liquids, he sought evaluation at the emergency department of the other hospital. CME at NEJM.org On evaluation, the patient described epigas-tric burning and nausea after eating. He had lost 13.6 kg of weight in the preceding year, including 5.4 kg in the past 2 weeks. He had no recent history of illness, night sweats, vomiting, dysphagia, odynophagia, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Dr. David A. Rosman: Computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a patulous esophagus, along with wall thickening in scattered areas of the upper and lower segments of the esophagus. There was abnormal circumferential wall thickening 13 mm in the stomach, particularly at the antrum, incisura, and pyloric canal Fig. 1. The antrum was decompressed or nonexpansile, and the rest of the stomach was distended. There were multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules 5 mm in diameter and multiple hepatic hypodensities 10 mm in diameter, as well as a pancreatic cyst 5 mm in diameter and an exophytic renal lesion 8 mm in diameter. Dr. Badran: A nasogastric tube was inserted. Treatment with intravenous pantoprazole was started, and intravenous lorazepam was administered for nausea. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. During the subsequent week, the patient received vitamin and mineral supplements for severe malnutrition. He remained unable to drink liquids. On the 7th hospital day, a peripherally inserted central catheter was placed, and total parenteral nutrition was administered. The patient was monitored for refeeding syndrome. On the 15th hospital day, he was transferred to this hospital for further treatment. On transfer to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The patient had a history of prediabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, divertic-ulosis, glaucoma, and basal cell carcinoma of the ear that had been resected. Five years before this admission, EGD had revealed a widely patent Schatzkis ring, an irregular-appearing Z line, and a few gastric polyps; examination of an esophageal biopsy specimen had revealed no abnormalities. Colonoscopy had shown two tubular adenomas. The patient had undergone orthognathic surgery, but there was no history of abdominal surgery. Medications included omeprazole, lisinopril, atorvastatin, vitamin D supplements, and bimatoprost and bromonidine eye drops. Sulfa drugs had caused a rash. The patient lived with his wife in a rural area of New England. He had previously served in the military and currently worked as a biotechnologist. He had never smoked tobacco, and he drank alcohol rarely. His mother and paternal aunt had died of colon cancer, his father of lung cancer, his maternal grandmother of breast cancer, and his maternal grandfather of prostate cancer. His two children and two grandchildren were healthy. On examination, the temperature was 37.7C, the blood pressure 128/76 mm Hg, the pulse 105 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was thin and had a nasogastric tube in place. He had normal mood, affect, and insight. The abdomen was flat, soft, and nondistended, with mild tenderness in the epigastrium on palpation. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. Distal sensory and motor function were normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Linitis plastica (invasive gastric adenocarcinoma). ", "prediction": "1.

Esophageal Stricture: The patulous esophagus with wall thickening and difficulty swallowing may indicate a stricture causing obstructive symptoms.\n4. Achalasia: The inability to pass liquids combined with a patulous esophagus might be due to achalasia, a motility disorder affecting esophageal function.\n5.

Peptic Ulcer Disease: The patient's history of GERD and ongoing epigastric pain could point toward peptic ulcer disease with complications leading to delayed gastric emptying.\n8. Amyloidosis: Given the history of systemic involvement (e.g., gastropathy, enlarged organs), amyloidosis could be a cause, particularly with gastrointestinal and renal manifestations.\n9. Paraneoplastic Syndrome: Considering the familial cancer history and presence of multiple nodules in organs, a paraneoplastic syndrome related to an undiagnosed malignancy may explain the symptoms.\n10.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: CME at NEJM.org Dr. David M. Dudzinski: A 76-year-old man was evaluated in the intensive care unit of this hospital for persistent postoperative cardiogenic shock and new diffuse rash after undergoing mitral-valve replacement. Two months before this evaluation, the patient was admitted to another hospital with anorexia, generalized weakness, fatigue, and edema. Examination of the lungs was notable for decreased breath sounds and basilar crackles. The level of N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide was 15,895 pg per milliliter reference value, 1500. Dr. Matthew T. Stib: A chest radiograph Fig. 1A showed a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette, as well as evidence of pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions. Dr. Dudzinski: At the other hospital, intravenous furosemide was administered. Blood cultures obtained at the time of admission grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus MSSA in four of four bottles. Transesophageal echocardiography TEE reportedly revealed moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation and a 7-mm vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Treatment with intravenous oxacillin was initiated; a 4-week course of treatment was planned, after which the patient was scheduled for follow-up in the cardiac surgery clinic at this hospital. However, 3 weeks after discharge, the patient reported dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, progressive edema of the legs, and weight gain of 7 kg. He was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Medical history was notable for hypertension, right bundle-branch block, hypothyroidism, and prostatism, as well as atrial fibrillation, for which the patient had undergone cardioversion. Surgical history included tooth extraction for a painful dental abscess 6 weeks before admission to the other hospital, appendectomy, arthroplasty of the left hip after a fall 3 years earlier, and repair of a meniscus tear in the left knee. Medications included oxacillin administered intravenously every 4 hours and oral furo-semide, sotalol, rivaroxaban, levothyroxine, and tamsulosin. He had had no known adverse drug reactions. The patient was retired and lived with his spouse. He reported that, before his admission to the other hospital, he had been riding a bicycle a few miles several times per week. He had previously smoked cigarettes but had quit 30 years earlier; he consumed one beer weekly and used no other substances. His family history was notable for atrial fibrillation. The temperature was 36.7C, the heart rate 83 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/72 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96 while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared fatigued. The jugular venous pressure was elevated, at 15 cm of water. The cardiac impulse was discrete and was not displaced. Auscultation of the chest revealed an irregularly irregular cardiac rhythm, with a grade 36 holo-systolic murmur at the left sternal border and apex that did not change with respiration, and bibasilar crackles. There was 2 pitting edema in the legs. A peripherally inserted central catheter was present in the right arm. The blood levels of calcium, magnesium, albumin, lipase, glycated hemoglobin, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were normal, and a screening test for human immunodeficiency virus antigen and antibodies was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of blood were obtained. An electrocardiogram Fig. 1B showed atrial fibrillation, multifocal ventricular premature beats, and right bundle-branch block. Dr. Stib: A chest radiograph Fig. 1C showed bilateral pulmonary edema, which was more prominent in the right lung than in the left lung, as well as pleural effusions and left atrial enlargement. The tip of a peripherally inserted central catheter was appropriately positioned in the lower superior vena cava. Dr. Dudzinski: Treatment with intravenous oxa-cillin and furosemide was continued. TEE Fig. 1D and transthoracic echocardiography TTE revealed a normal-sized left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 61, dilatation of the right ven-tricle with normal function, dilatation of both atria, mitral-valve perforation and thickening, severe mitral regurgitation due to mitral-valve perforation, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation with a right ventricular systolic pressure of 48 mm Hg also see Videos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Coronary angiography revealed 70 stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and 90 stenosis in the middle right coronary artery. On hospital day 11, cardiac surgery was performed. The patient underwent bioprosthetic mitral-valve replacement, along with two-vessel coronary-artery bypass grafting and amputation of the left atrial appendage. TEE performed after the surgical procedure revealed a well-seated mitral prosthesis with trace central regurgitation, as well as mild biventricular systolic dysfunction. Subsequently, on transfer to the intensive care unit, the blood pressure was 108/52 mm Hg and the cardiac index 3.0 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area while the patient was receiving epinephrine at a rate of 2 g per minute, norepineph-rine 10 g per minute, and vasopressin 0.04 U per minute. An electrocardiogram Fig. 1E showed atrial fibrillation, right bundle-branch block, and ventricular premature beats. During postoperative day 1, the patient had increased ventricular ectopy and a 25-beat run of ventricular tachycardia. Laboratory and hemody-namic data are shown in Table 1. Dr. Stib: An anteroposterior chest radiograph Fig. 1F showed left atrial enlargement, bilateral pulmonary edema, and basilar atelectasis, along with sternotomy wires, an endotracheal tube, a catheter in the right main pulmonary artery, bilateral chest tubes, and a mediastinal drain. Dr. Dudzinski: Treatment with intravenous ami-odarone was started, and the epinephrine infusion was discontinued. On postoperative day 2, the trachea was extu-bated, and mechanical ventilation was discontinued. The cardiac index had decreased to less than 2.0 liters per minute per square meter, and intravenous milrinone was initiated. The next day, a 35-beat run of ventricular tachycardia occurred. On postoperative day 4, given that the cardiac index was less than 1.9 liters per minute per square meter, intravenous dopamine was started. On postoperative day 5, deep-vein thrombosis was identified in the right lower leg, and treatment with warfarin was started. A truncal macular rash was noted. TTE revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 32, right ventricular dysfunction, atrial dilatation, trace central prosthetic mitral regurgitation with a mean transmitral gradient of 5 mm Hg measured at 70 beats per minute, and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation see Video 3. There was also worsening renal function. Milrinone was stopped and epinephrine initiated. On postoperative day 8, microbiologic cultures obtained during the surgical procedure showed no growth; the patients oxacillin treatment was switched to cefazolin. During the next few days, the rash became more confluent and extended to the face, back, arms, and neck in addition to the trunk, but there was no mu-cosal involvement. Examination of the joints was normal, and there was no lymphadenopa-thy or hepatosplenomegaly. The arms and legs were cool, and urine output had decreased, despite continued therapy with intravenous epi-nephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Repeat TTE on postoperative day 13 revealed borderline left ventricular dilatation with an ejection fraction of 37, right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction, and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation. Additional diagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.

Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's severe mitral regurgitation, ventricular ectopy, and significant weight gain indicate worsening heart failure post-surgery.\n\n4. Post-cardiotomy syndrome: The presence of pericardial involvement, inflammation, and a diffuse rash are consistent with a post-surgical inflammatory reaction.\n\n5. Renal failure: The worsening renal function, reduced urine output, and edema may indicate acute kidney injury secondary to heart failure or medications.\n\n6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Identified by evidence of leg edema and confirmed on postoperative day 5, contributing to symptoms like swelling and leg pain.\n\n7. Amiodarone-induced rash: The truncal macular rash that spread following the initiation of intravenous amiodarone suggests a possible drug reaction.\n\n8. Pulmonary embolism: Given the patient's DVT and postoperative state, a pulmonary embolism needs to be ruled out as it can mimic heart failure symptoms with sudden dyspnea and hypotension.\n\n9. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The bilateral pulmonary edema and diffuse lung crackles after mitral valve surgery can indicate ARDS as a postoperative complication.\n\n10.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: CME Dr. Natalie A. Diacovo Pediatrics: An 11-year-old girl was evaluated in the rheuma-tology clinic of this hospital because of redness of the eyes. The patient had been well until 8 weeks before the current evaluation, when she noticed mild eye redness, which was worse in the right eye than in the left eye. There was intermittent swelling of the eyelids but no photophobia, itching, pain, tearing, or discharge. The patients parents administered naphazoline hydrochloride and glycerin eye drops, but the eye redness did not abate. When the eye redness had persisted for 2 weeks, the patient was taken to the pediatrics clinic of another hospital. She was given a 7-day course of an oral antibiotic agent as empirical treatment for possible preseptal cellulitis. Five weeks before the current evaluation, the eye redness persisted despite treatment, and the patient was referred to the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital. The blood pressure was not measured during this evaluation. The visual acuity with correction was 2020 in the right eye and 2025 in the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Slit-lamp examination revealed abundant white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes, with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were also keratic precipitates, posterior synechiae, and rare iris nodules in the right eye. Funduscopic examination was notable for optic-disk swelling and peripheral retinal hemorrhages in both eyes, as well as perivascular exudates in the right eye. Cyclopentolate eye drops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes were prescribed. During the subsequent 3 weeks, additional tests were performed in the pediatrics clinic of the other hospital. Screening blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus HIV types 1 and 2, syphilis, and Lyme disease were negative. An interferon- release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was indeterminate. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Radiography of the chest revealed hilar fullness. Dr. Maria G. Figueiro Longo: Computed tomography CT of the chest and abdomen Fig. 1A and 1B, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed a normal-appearing thymus. However, diffuse lymphadenopathy was detected in the mediastinum, upper abdomen, and axillae, with the largest lymph node measuring 2.0 cm by 1.3 cm by 1.8 cm. Dr. Diacovo: Two weeks before the current evaluation, the patient was asked to present to the emergency department of the other hospital for an expedited workup. On evaluation, she described eye redness that had persisted but decreased in severity. She reported no fever, weight loss, night sweats, rash, headache, cough, shortness of breath, or joint pain. On examination, the temperature was 37.0C, the blood pressure 96/61 mm Hg, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 18.3. The patient appeared well, with no oral lesions or rash. The visual acuity was unchanged. Slit-lamp examination revealed keratic precipitates and white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes, with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were extensive posterior synechiae in the right eye. Funduscopic examination Fig. 2 showed vitreous white cells, optic-disk swelling, perivascular exudates, peripheral retinal hemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots in both eyes. The lungs were clear on auscultation. Urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Methylprednisolone was administered, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. During the next 4 days, additional tests were performed, and sputum specimens were obtained for an acid-fast bacilli smear and culture. Optical coherence tomography revealed optic-disk swelling but no cystoid macular swelling. Fluorescein angiography revealed optic-disk leakage with areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion and some vessel leakage. Dr. Figueiro Longo: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head Fig. 1C, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed protrusion and enhancement of the optic disks and enhancement of the irises, a finding consistent with the clinical diagnosis of uveitis. There was no evidence of optic neuritis or perineuritis. Dr. Diacovo: The administration of cyclopentolate eye drops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes was continued. Treatment with oral prednisone was started, and a regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide was begun as empirical treatment for possible tuberculosis. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was discharged home. She was instructed to follow up in the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital and was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. In the rheumatology clinic, additional history was obtained. The patient had had normal growth and development and was currently in middle school. She had received all routine childhood vaccinations. She had emigrated from West Africa to the United States 6 years earlier; since then, she had lived with her mother and father in a suburban town in New England and had not traveled outside the region. Six months before this evaluation, an interferon-γ release assay for M. tuberculosis had been positive. At that time, the patient had received a prescription for a medication to treat latent tuberculosis infection; however, the patient’s parents could not recall giving the medication to the patient. She was taking the prescribed cyclopentolate and prednisolone eye drops, oral prednisone, and regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. There were no known drug allergies. The patient’s parents were healthy. A diagnosis and management decisions were made. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Sarcoidosis. ", "prediction": "1. Tuberculosis (TB): Given the positive interferon-γ release assay for M. tuberculosis six months prior, and presenting uveitis and lymphadenopathy, ocular tuberculosis is a strong consideration.\n2. Sarcoidosis: The generalized lymphadenopathy, hilar fullness on chest radiography, and uveitis are consistent with sarcoidosis, a systemic granulomatous disease.\n3. Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis: The chronic uveitis and absence of systemic symptoms can be indicative of JIA, which often presents with ocular involvement.\n4. Infectious Uveitis: The persistent eye redness despite antibiotics and the findings of anterior chamber white cells necessitate consideration of other infectious etiologies beyond TB.\n5. Toxoplasmosis: As a leading cause of posterior uveitis, the presence of vitritis, optic-disk swelling, and retinal lesions requires consideration of toxoplasmic chorioretinitis.\n6. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Disease: The combination of bilateral panuveitis with optic-disk swelling and absence of central nervous system involvement might suggest VKH, especially in its early stages.\n7. Behçet Disease: Though less likely due to the lack of oral ulcers and systemic symptoms, the bilateral uveitis and retinal vasculitis warrants consideration of Behçet's disease.\n8. Cat Scratch Disease: Considering the lymphadenopathy and ocular findings, Bartonella henselae infection should be considered especially with possible pet exposures.\n9. Lupus (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus - SLE): Uveitis associated with optic nerve involvement and widespread lymphadenopathy can also be seen in pediatric SLE.\n10. Lymphoma: Given the diffuse lymphadenopathy and ocular symptoms, a hematologic malignancy such as lymphoma should be considered, particularly in the context of systemic symptoms."}

Kritzer: A 57-year-old woman with major depressive disorder and coro-navirus disease 2019 Covid-19 was evaluated at a hospital affiliated with this hospital because she was having delusions that she was dead. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 2 weeks before this presentation, when myalgias, cough, sore throat, nausea, and vomiting developed. She sought evaluation at the primary care clinic of an academic medical center affiliated with this hospital the two hospitals are part of the same health care system. Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and the patient was instructed to quarantine at home. She lived with her father and assisted him with activities of daily living; he also received a diagnosis of Covid-19. During the following week, the patients cough persisted, and new shortness of breath developed. Her symptoms worsened; she felt that she was unable to take care of her father. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient and her father were taken to the emergency department of the other hospital, where they were both admitted for worsening Covid-19 pneumonia. The patient was treated with supplemental oxygen, remdesivir, and dexamethasone. Treatment with rem-desivir was stopped on hospital day 4 when the blood aminotransferase levels increased to three times the upper limit of the normal range. During the hospitalization, the patient was noted to have intermittent anxiety, particularly when discharge planning for her father was discussed. She and her brother declined to have their father discharged to a rehabilitation center and instead planned for him to eventually return home to quarantine with the patient. On hospital day 6, the patients oxygen saturation was normal while she was breathing ambient air, and the blood aminotransferase levels had improved. She was discharged home with instructions to quarantine and continue taking dexa-methasone. One day after discharge, the patients brother spoke to her on the telephone. CME at NEJM.org He thought that she seemed to be confused and unable to take care of herself, and he asked her to return to the emergency department of the other hospital. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient explained that she was unsure why her brother had asked her to return to the hospital, and she said that she wanted to go home. She also expressed that she felt anxious about being home alone after discharge and overwhelmed about needing to care for her father at home once he was discharged from the hospital. The myalgias, cough, and shortness of breath had abated; she had no fevers, visual or auditory hallucinations, or suicidal or homicidal ideation. The patient had a history of major depressive disorder, which had been diagnosed during the second decade of life. At the time of diagnosis, she had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital and had received electroconvulsive therapy; thereafter, she had been discharged to a partial hospital program. She had been hospitalized for psychiatric symptoms twice since then, once for major depressive disorder and once for a mixed bipolar episode that was due to insomnia and anxious distress. The latter episode was associated with catatonic features and was treated with electroconvulsive therapy. The patient had no history of suicidal or homicidal ideation or attempts and no history of violence. She had hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included dexamethasone, bupropion, fluoxetine, olanzapine, losartan, metformin, and pantoprazole. Sulfa drugs had caused angio-edema, and lisinopril had caused cough. The patient was born in the Caribbean and had emigrated four decades earlier, first to southwestern Europe and then to the United States 2 years later. She lived in an apartment in an urban area of New England with her father, who had mild dementia. She did not drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or use illicit substances. On examination, the temperature was 37.2C, the pulse 97 beats per minute, the blood pressure 153/95 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and oriented but guarded, with a flat affect. She appeared to be more anxious than she had been during the previous hospitalization. She paced around the room and perseverated about the care of her father. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The white-cell count was 11,490 per microliter reference range, 4000 to 11,000, with neutrophil predominance; the complete blood count with differential count was otherwise normal. Urinalysis and a radio-graph of the chest were normal. Treatment with dexamethasone was stopped, and the patient was admitted to the hospital to facilitate discharge to a rehabilitation center for continued care. On hospital day 3, the patient was noted to be more withdrawn, and she began responding to questions with one-word answers or silence. When she was encouraged to speak more, she continued to perseverate about the care of her father. When she was asked to elaborate on her concerns, she stated, He is dead. I am dead. The patient appeared disheveled, sullen, and anxious. She laid in bed motionless with her eyes open and looking forward, and she responded briefly to questions in a quiet voice with slowed speech. Her thoughts were persev-erative and tangential. There was no evidence that she had loosening of associations, hallucinations, or suicidal or homicidal ideation. She had poor insight and judgment. Memory, attention, concentration, abstract reasoning, and fund of knowledge were normal. When her arms and legs were lifted against gravity and released, they fell to the bed without resistance; with encouragement, she was able to move them. Muscle tone was normal, with no rigidity or waxy flexibility. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Aaron B. Paul: Computed tomography CT of the head Fig. 1, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no evidence of an acute territorial infarct, intracranial mass, or hemorrhage. There was nonspecific moderate confluent hypoattenu-ation involving the supratentorial white matter. Dr. Kritzer: Clonazepam was administered, and the dose of olanzapine was increased. Admission to an inpatient psychiatric unit was recommended. During the next week, while awaiting placement in an inpatient psychiatric unit, the patient continued to show signs of anxiety and a depressed mood. She said, I am dead. I do not exist. I am not real. She also believed that her father and brother, as well as her nurses and doctors, were dead. The patient was selectively mute and motionless, but she talked and moved with encouragement. She expressed that she felt directly responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic and asked to be thrown out of the window. She had the sensation that her bladder was gone and that she could not urinate, although she had been observed urinating independently. She felt that she could not eat, although she had been observed eating breakfast daily. On hospital day 9, the patient was transferred to the inpatient psychiatric unit of the other hospital. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Cotard’s syndrome, catatonia, depression, and seizure after coronavirus disease 2019.

Chwalisz: A 30-year-old woman was evaluated in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic at a hospital affiliated with this hospital because of monocular vision loss. Two months before the current presentation, during the third trimester of the patients first pregnancy, headache and decreased vision in the right eye developed. The patient thought that the headache felt like previous migraines, which had been infrequent. However, decreased vision had not been a typical feature of her migraines. Colors appeared dim, and light perception was decreased. There was soreness in the right eye but no pain with eye movement. Five days later, the patient was evaluated by an optometrist. She reported that she could see only shapes and movements. On a visual field test, there was a normal response in the left eye but no response in the right eye. The patient was instructed to seek evaluation in an emergency department of another hospital. In the emergency department, magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head, which was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material because of the pregnancy, revealed marked enlargement of the intraorbital right optic nerve. The nerve appeared isointense as compared with the extraocular muscles on the T1-weighted sequences but appeared bright on the T2-weighted sequence; the globes appeared normal, and the extraocular muscles were not enlarged. The results of magnetic resonance venography of the head were normal. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and treatment with intravenous methyl-prednisolone was initiated for a working diagnosis of optic neuritis. During the hospitalization, her ability to see colors improved slightly, but her vision did not improve; she could see only hand motions. On the fifth hospital day, she was discharged home with instructions to schedule follow-up appointments with a neurologist and an optometrist. One month after discharge from the other hospital and 2 weeks before the current presentation, the patient was again evaluated by her optometrist. The vision in the right eye had worsened; she was no longer able to see shadows or movements. The patient was referred for evaluation by a neuro-ophthalmologist. On the current presentation to the neuro-ophthalmology clinic of a hospital affiliated with this hospital, the patient reported no improvement in vision and ongoing soreness in the right eye. There was a history of Lyme disease, which had been diagnosed during the second trimester of pregnancy and had been treated with amoxi-cillin. Medications included prenatal vitamins and ferrous sulfate. The patient lived with her husband in New England and worked in health care. She had never smoked tobacco and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. A brother had a history of childhood epilepsy, and her mother had macular degeneration. On examination, the visual acuity was 2015 in the left eye, and there was no light perception in the right eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, although the response in the right pupil was sluggish; an afferent pupillary defect was present in the right eye. On the Ishi-hara color test, all plates were identified with the left eye. On a visual field test, there was a normal response in the left eye. The Ishihara color test and the visual field test could not be performed on the right eye because of poor vision. The results of a slit-lamp examination were normal, with no cells identified in the anterior chamber or vitreous. On a funduscopic examination Fig. 1A and 1B, the optic disk in the right eye was swollen and had temporal pallor; there was a small area of hypopigmentation close to the macula in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography revealed increased thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer and circumferential thinning of the ganglion cell complex of the right eye; no abnormalities were noted in the left eye. The blood creatinine level was 0.56 mg per deciliter 50 mol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter 53 to 133 mol per liter and the blood alkaline phosphatase level 147 U per liter reference range, 30 to 100. The results of other kidney-function and liver-function tests were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes, the complete blood count, and the results of coagulation tests. The blood C-reactive protein level was 15 mg per liter reference value, 8 and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 34 mm per hour reference range, 0 to 20. A blood test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:40 with a speckled pattern. Tests for antibodies against aquaporin-4 and myelin oligo-dendrocyte glycoprotein MOG were negative. A diagnosis of atypical optic neuritis was considered. Because the patient was near delivery, further treatment was delayed until after the birth of her child, which occurred 3 days later. Six days after delivery of the baby, the patient was admitted to this hospital, and additional studies were obtained. Lumbar puncture was performed. On cerebrospinal fluid CSF analysis, there were no nucleated cells, and the levels of protein, glucose, albumin, and IgG were normal. There was no oligoclonal banding after concentration of the CSF. Testing of the CSF was negative for syphilis antibodies and for antibodies against aquaporin-4. Dr. Benjamin M. Kozak: MRI of the head Fig. 2, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed prominent fusiform enlargement of a segment of the intraorbital right optic nerve with associated enhancement, as well as associated hyperintensity on the T2-weighted short-tau inversion recovery STIR sequence. There was no evidence of associated orbital edema or other orbital abnormalities. There was a punctate hyperintense focus within the left parietal subcortical white matter on the T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence, without associated enhancement or restricted diffusion. Dr. Chwalisz: Treatment with intravenous methyl-prednisolone and daily plasmapheresis was administered. On the fourth hospital day, the soreness in the right eye had resolved, and there was light perception in the right eye. On the fifth hospital day, treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was changed to oral predni-sone. On the ninth hospital day, rituximab was administered, and the patient was discharged home with a prescription for a 7-week tapering course of prednisone. During the next 3 weeks, treatment with rituximab was administered weekly. Two weeks after the last rituximab infusion, the patient was evaluated in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic at the hospital affiliated with this hospital. She reported no eye pain and only occasional headache, but she noted that the vision in the right eye had worsened. Examination revealed no light perception in the right eye, with an afferent pu-pillary defect. The results of a visual field test and the Ishihara color test were unchanged from the previous evaluation in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic. On a funduscopic examination Fig. 1C, the optic disk in the right eye was swollen and had more pronounced temporal pallor; optociliary shunt vessels were also newly present. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Kozak: Follow-up MRI of the head Fig. 2 revealed no radiologically significant change in the segmental enlargement of the intraorbital right optic nerve, with persistent enhancement as well as hyperintensity on the T2-weighted STIR sequence. No new orbital abnormalities were present. In addition, the punctate lesion in the left parietal subcortical white matter was unchanged. Dr. Chwalisz: A diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Meningioma, meningothelial type, World Health Organization grade 1. ", "prediction": "1. Optic Neuritis: Given the acute, monocular vision loss with optic nerve enhancement on MRI, and some improvement with steroid treatment, optic neuritis is the primary diagnosis.\n2. Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD): Despite negative aquaporin-4 antibodies, NMOSD should still be considered due to the severe optic neuritis and poor response to treatment.\n3. Multiple Sclerosis: Although atypical for MS, the presence of a punctate lesion in the left parietal subcortical white matter and optic neuritis could indicate early MS.\n4. Inflammatory Optic Neuropathy: The elevated ESR and CRP, along with the optic nerve findings, suggest inflammation that could be due to a systemic inflammatory condition.\n5. Sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis can cause granulomatous inflammation of the optic nerve, leading to the symptoms described.\n6. Compressive Optic Neuropathy: Although MRI did not show a mass, compressive optic neuropathy from a small undetectable lesion could be considered.\n7. Autoimmune Optic Neuropathy: The positive ANA titer suggests a potential autoimmune optic neuropathy, possibly associated with conditions like lupus or other collagen vascular diseases.\n8. Lyme Disease-Related Optic Neuritis: Given the patient’s history of Lyme disease, a relapse or inadequate treatment causing inflammation of the optic nerve is a possibility.\n9. Infectious Optic Neuritis: Other infectious causes, though less likely, such as syphilis (with negative CSF testing) should still be considered given the optic nerve involvement.\n10. Paraneoplastic Optic Neuropathy: Although rare, a paraneoplastic syndrome could manifest with optic neuropathy, especially if associated with underlying malignancy not yet identified."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: CME at NEJM.org Dr. Jarone Lee: A 55-year-old man was admitted to this hospital 7 months after kidney transplantation because of fatigue, weight loss, and new pulmonary nodules. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 1 week before this admission, when severe fatigue and generalized weakness developed. He had lost 4.5 kg in the past month after making healthier dietary choices; however, he had also noticed abdominal discomfort and a decrease in appetite. During the next week, the patient was able to eat and drink very little and lost an additional 4.5 kg. The fatigue and weakness worsened, and he mostly stayed in bed. He had several episodes of lightheadedness, gait instability, and falls while he was walking to the bathroom. There was new odynophagia, dysphagia, and nausea. On the day of admission, the patient was evaluated at the transplant nephrol-ogy clinic of this hospital before a scheduled infusion of belatacept. The temperature was 37.3C, the blood pressure 70/50 mm Hg, the heart rate 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 35 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while he was breathing ambient air. He appeared cachectic and lethargic. He was transported by ambulance from the clinic to the emergency department of this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient reported malaise and feeling like he had no energy or strength. The lightheadedness and gait instability persisted. A review of systems was notable for shortness of breath, dark urine, and continued anorexia, nausea, odynophagia, dysphagia, and abdominal discomfort. He reported no chills, night sweats, cough, chest pain, vomiting, hematochezia, melena, or dysuria. The patient had a history of sarcoidosis. Nine years before this admission, nephrocalcinosis caused end-stage kidney disease. Hemodialysis was started, and this treatment was continued until a deceased-donor kidney transplantation was performed 7 months before this admission. Routine serologic testing performed before transplantation was positive for EpsteinBarr virus EBV IgG and cytomega-lovirus CMV IgG. An interferon- release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Serologic testing in the donor was also positive for EBV IgG but was negative for CMV IgG. Induction immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin was initiated; maintenance therapy included prednisone, mycopheno-late mofetil, and tacrolimus. Six months before the current admission, pathological examination of a biopsy specimen from the transplanted kidney revealed vascular disease of donor origin and acute tubular injury but no evidence of T-cellmediated or antibody-mediated rejection. Treatment with tacrolimus was stopped and belatacept started; prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil therapy was continued. One month before the current admission, pathological examination of another biopsy specimen from the transplanted kidney revealed focal infiltrates that were vaguely granulomatous and were associated with ruptured tubules and interstitial TammHorsfall protein also known as uromodulin. There was no evidence of allograft rejection. Two weeks before the current admission, laboratory tests revealed a blood creatinine level of 2.31 mg per deciliter 204.2 mol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter 53.0 to 132.6 mol per liter; routine laboratory tests had revealed similar creatinine levels during the previous 6 months. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient also had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gout. Current medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, labetalol, nifedip-ine, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, valganci-clovir, prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and belatacept. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with his mother in an urban area of New England and had never traveled outside the region. He worked as an administrator and had never been homeless or incarcerated. He had no sexual partners and did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. On the day of evaluation in the emergency department, the temperature was 36.7C, the blood pressure 80/50 mm Hg, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 92 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 20.5. The patient was lethargic and spoke in sentences of three or four words. The mucous membranes were dry, and the throat could not be evaluated because of nausea. There was no cervical lymph-adenopathy. Auscultation of the lungs revealed diffuse inspiratory crackles. Neurologic examination was limited but was notable for 45 motor strength in the arms and legs. The blood level of creatinine was 5.05 mg per deciliter 446.4 mol per liter, the calcium level 13.1 mg per deciliter 3.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter 2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter, the lactic acid level 4.4 mmol per liter 39.6 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter 4.5 to 18.0 mg per deciliter, and the hemoglobin level 6.6 g per deciliter reference range, 13.5 to 17.5. Cultures of blood were obtained. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Mark C. Murphy: Computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material. CT of the chest Fig. 1 revealed innumerable bilateral miliary pulmonary nodules that were new relative to a CT scan that had been obtained 6 months earlier. The nodules were in a random distribution that was suggestive of a hematogenous origin. Trace bilateral pleural effusions were present, as was calcified mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy; the lymphadenopathy appeared unchanged from previous imaging. CT of the spleen Fig. 2 revealed new splenomegaly. There was new mild dilatation of the renal collecting system of the transplanted kidney in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Dr. Lee: While the patient was being evaluated in the emergency department, the temperature increased to 39.6C. Intravenous fluids and intravenous infusion of phenylephrine were administered. Empirical treatment with vancomycin, ce-fepime, metronidazole, levofloxacin, doxycycline, and micafungin was started; trimethoprimsul-famethoxazole and valganciclovir were continued. Treatment with prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued, and hydrocortisone therapy was started. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Within 24 hours after admission, the oxygen saturation had decreased to 84 while the patient was breathing ambient air; supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 94. Continuous intra-venous infusion of phenylephrine was continued, and norepinephrine was added to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure above 65 mm Hg. Two units of packed red cells were transfused. The creatinine level decreased to 3.82 mg per deciliter 337.7 mol per liter, the lactic acid level to 1.6 mmol per liter 14.4 mg per deciliter, and the calcium level to 8.9 mg per deciliter 2.2 mmol per liter. Treatment with levofloxacin and micafungin was stopped; isavuconazole was started. A diagnostic test was performed.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection: Given the patient's immunosuppressive therapy and new pulmonary nodules, CMV reactivation or infection is highly plausible.\n2. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-related Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD): The patient's history of EBV positivity and immunosuppression raises the possibility of PTLD presenting with systemic symptoms and pulmonary nodules.\n3. Fungal infection (e.g., Aspergillosis): Immunocompromised status and bilateral miliary pulmonary nodules strongly suggest an invasive fungal infection.\n4. Drug-induced pneumonitis: The patient’s extensive immunosuppressive regimen, which includes belatacept and mycophenolate mofetil, can predispose him to drug-induced lung toxicity.\n5. Tuberculosis: Despite a negative interferon-gamma release assay, the clinical presentation of fatigue, weight loss, and pulmonary nodules warrants consideration of TB, especially considering his new immunosuppressive state.\n6. Acute pulmonary embolism: The combination of sudden severe fatigue, weight loss, and hypoxia could indicate a pulmonary embolism, especially in a hospitalized patient.\n7. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): Severe immunosuppression and neurologic symptoms such as lethargy and motor weakness raise the suspicion of PML, though primarily demyelinating, it may have systemic impacts.\n8. Hypercalcemia of malignancy: The significant hypercalcemia may suggest an underlying malignancy causing systemic symptoms and possibly metastatic pulmonary nodules.\n9. Bacterial sepsis: The patient's hypotension, fever, and organ dysfunction suggest sepsis from a bacterial infection, potentially complicated by secondary pulmonary involvement.\n10. Sarcoidosis relapse: Although less likely given the immunosuppressive therapy, a relapse of sarcoidosis could still present with systemic symptoms and pulmonary involvement.\n\n"}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Kathy M. Tran Medicine: A 21-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of fatigue, weight gain, and abdominal pain. The patient had been well until 4 months before the current evaluation, when an episode of dull, aching pain in the right lower quadrant occurred. The pain lasted for a few hours before resolving spontaneously. During the next 4 months, episodes of abdominal pain continued to occur and increased in duration, frequency, and severity. The patient sought evaluation in the gynecology clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient described the pain as variable, rating it between 3 and 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The episodes of pain occurred daily and lasted for up to 20 hours. The pain decreased with sitting or lying down and did not increase with movement; it was not associated with her menstrual period. The patient also reported fatigue, irritability, and weight gain of 4.5 kg in the previous 4 months despite increased exercise and decreased food intake. There was a history of hypothyroidism, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, and migraines. The patient had never been pregnant and had no known history of sexually transmitted infections or abnormal results on screening tests for cervical cancer. She had previously been sexually active with male partners, but she reported no current sexual activity. She had taken oral contraceptives for 2 years but had stopped taking them 6 months before this evaluation, when a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device IUD was placed. Other medications included levo-thyroxine, citalopram, and multivitamins; there were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with roommates in an urban area of New England. She was a former athlete and worked as a research scientist. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her family history included hypothyroidism in her mother, coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia in her father, breast cancer and diabetes in her paternal grandmother, and lung cancer in her paternal grandfather. CME at NEJM.org On examination, the blood pressure was 119/73 mm Hg and the heart rate 62 beats per minute. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 28.4. The thyroid was firm on palpation, with a small nodule noted on the right side. The abdomen was nondistended, soft, and nontender. A small hernia with a thrill was noted at the right inguinal ring. A speculum examination of the vagina and cervix was normal; IUD strings were visible at the cervical os. The complete blood count was normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes and glucose and results of tests for kidney, liver, and thyroid function. Screening tests for gonorrhea, chlamydia, human immunodeficiency virus, and syphilis were negative. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Madeleine Sertic: Transabdominal and trans-vaginal ultrasonography of the abdomen and pel-vis revealed a mass measuring 4.8 cm by 5.0 cm by 3.9 cm along the posterior aspect of the right hepatic lobe Fig. 1A. The uterus, ovaries, and adnexa were normal. There was no free fluid in the pelvis, and the IUD was in an appropriate position. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a right adrenal mass measuring 4.5 cm by 4.7 cm by 4.0 cm that was T2 isointense Fig. 1B and T1 hypointense. The mass had diffusion restriction Fig. 1C, as well as early enhancement with washout, which refers to the temporal reduction in the enhancement of a lesion. The features were indeterminate and were not definitively diagnostic of adrenal adenoma or another adrenal lesion, such as pheochromocytoma or adre-nocortical carcinoma. Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis again revealed a right adrenal mass, which had a density of 33 Hounsfield units HU before the administration of contrast material Fig. 1D, 74 HU during the portal-venous phase Fig. 1E, and 45 HU during the 15-minute delayed phase Fig. 1F. The absolute washout was calculated as 71. The absolute washout is calculated by dividing the difference between the portal-venousphase density and the delayed-phase density by the difference between the portal-venousphase density and the unenhanced density and then converting the result to a percentage: HU portal-venous phase  HU delayed phase  HU portal-venous phase  HU unen-hanced  100. Adrenal adenomas tend to wash out faster than other adrenal lesions, and an absolute washout of more than 60 is highly suggestive of an adrenal adenoma. However, lesions larger than 4 cm are likely to be malignant, regardless of the washout characteristics.1 There was also a thin-walled cyst measuring 3.3 cm in diameter in the lower lobe of the left lung. Dr. Tran: The patient was referred to the endocrinology clinic of this hospital. Additional laboratory tests were performed to further evaluate the adrenal mass. Blood levels of renin and aldo-sterone were normal, as were urinary levels of catecholamines and metanephrines. An overnight, low-dose dexamethasone suppression test was performed. The baseline blood corticotropin level was 3 pg per milliliter 0.7 pmol per liter; reference range, 6 to 76 pg per milliliter 1.3 to 16.7 pmol per liter. At 11 p.m., dexamethasone 1 mg was administered; at 8 a.m., the blood cortisol level was 9.1 g per deciliter 251 nmol per liter; reference value, 1.8 g per deciliter 50 nmol per liter, and the concurrent blood dexamethasone level was 631 ng per deciliter reference range, 140 to 295. The 24-hour urinary free cortisol level was 31.0 g reference range, 3.5 to 45.0; the blood levels of dehydro-epiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were normal. Management decisions were made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Adrenocortical carcinoma. ", "prediction": "1. Adrenal Adenoma: The presence of an adrenal mass which shows remarkable washout on imaging suggests a benign adrenal adenoma, although the size of the lesion raises concerns about potential malignancy. \n2. Adrenocortical Carcinoma: Given the size of the adrenal mass (>4 cm), there is a significant risk that it may represent an adrenocortical carcinoma, particularly since larger adrenal lesions are more frequently malignant.\n3. Hypothyroidism: Despite being on levothyroxine, the patient's fatigue and weight gain along with a firm thyroid and small nodule suggest that hypothyroidism may not be well-controlled.\n4. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): The patient's weight gain, history of menstrual irregularities due to hypothyroidism, and previous contraceptive use might indicate PCOS.\n5. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Given the ongoing fatigue and abdominal pain without clear etiology, chronic fatigue syndrome could be a consideration.\n6. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): The patient's history of IBS could explain the recurrent episodes of abdominal pain she reports.\n7. Pheochromocytoma: An adrenal mass with indeterminate features could be a pheochromocytoma, especially although her catecholamine levels were normal.\n8. Adrenal Cyst: The characteristics of the adrenal mass and associated cyst in the lung could point towards a benign adrenal cyst.\n9. Cushing's Syndrome: Despite normal urine cortisol levels, the high cortisol during the dexamethasone suppression test could indicate Cushing’s Syndrome associated with the adrenal mass.\n10. Inguinal Hernia: The thrill felt at the right inguinal ring suggests an inguinal hernia, which could be contributing to the patient's abdominal pain.\n\n"}

Bunnell Obstetrics and Gynecology: A 31-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital 15 days after the birth of her first child because of abdominal pain and fever. The patient had received routine prenatal care at this hospital. Serologic screening during the pregnancy showed immunity to rubella. Rectovaginal culture was positive for group B streptococcus. Tests for syphilis, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and human immunodeficiency virus were negative. Sixteen days before this admission, the patient went into labor at 38 weeks 1 day of gestation. She was admitted to this hospital. The white-cell count was 13,800 per microliter reference range, 4500 to 11,000, and the hemoglobin level was 14.0 g per deciliter reference range, 12.0 to 16.0; treatment with intravenous penicillin was started. On hospital day 2, an epidural anesthetic agent was administered. Artificial rupture of the membranes revealed clear, odorless fluid, and infusion of oxytocin was started. Six hours after artificial rupture of the membranes, the patient gave birth to a healthy baby by vaginal delivery. Three minutes later, the placenta was delivered intact. Immediately after delivery, hemorrhage due to uterine atony occurred; there was an estimated blood loss of 500 ml. Bimanual massage of the uterus was performed, and oxytocin and methylergonovine were administered; hemostasis was subsequently achieved. A perineal laceration was repaired. The patient began breast-feeding, and on postpartum day 1, she was discharged. Six days before the current admission, on postpartum day 9, pain in the left upper quadrant developed. The pain was dull, radiated to the left flank and back, and was worse with movement and deep breathing. The patient presented to a local urgent care clinic; urine was obtained for culture, and empirical treatment with amoxicillinclavulanate was started. Five days before this admission, on postpartum day 10, abdominal pain persisted, and a fever with a temporal temperature of 38.3C developed. The patient sought evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital. She rated the abdominal pain at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe CME at NEJM.org pain. A review of systems was notable for nausea and minimal lochia; there was no diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, or breast tenderness. On examination, the abdomen was soft, and there was mild tenderness on palpation of the left upper quadrant, the uterine fundus, the supra-pubic region, and the left costovertebral angle. Pelvic examination, including examination with the use of a speculum, revealed no dehiscence, drainage, or hematoma at the site of the peri-neal laceration repair and no discharge from the cervical os; there was mild cervical motion tenderness. The white-cell count was 20,700 per microliter. The level of hemoglobin was 11.4 g per deciliter. Blood cultures were obtained. The urine culture obtained at the urgent care clinic was positive for group B streptococcus. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with ceftriaxone was started, and the patient was admitted to the hospital for presumed pyelonephritis. On hospital day 3, when the fever and abdominal pain resolved, the patient was discharged home to complete a course of amoxicillin. During the subsequent 2 days, the patient continued to take amoxicillin at home, but fever and abdominal and flank pain returned. On postpartum day 15, when the pain did not abate after she took acetaminophen, she returned to the emergency department of this hospital. The patients medical history included high-grade cervical dysplasia that had led to a loop electrosurgical excision procedure 5 years earlier, as well as a ruptured ovarian cyst 3 years earlier and nephrolithiasis on the left side 5 months earlier. The patient had not been pregnant before the recent pregnancy; before this pregnancy, she had taken oral contraceptives for 12 years. She took prenatal vitamins, as well as polyethylene glycol, docusate, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen as needed. She had no known drug allergies. She lived with her husband and newborn infant in an urban area of New England and worked as an office manager. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had multiple sclerosis and her father had coronary artery disease; her brother was healthy. On examination, the abdomen was soft, and there was mild tenderness in the left upper quadrant and at the left costovertebral angle. There was no tenderness on palpation of the uterine fundus or the suprapubic region and no cervical motion tenderness. The white-cell count was 10,330 per microliter. The hemoglobin level was 11.2 g per deciliter, the alanine aminotrans-ferase ALT level 153 U per liter reference range, 7 to 33, the aspartate aminotransferase AST level 44 U per liter reference range, 9 to 32, and the alkaline phosphatase level 194 U per liter reference range, 30 to 100. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to this hospital. The next day, the hemoglobin level decreased to 9.7 g per deciliter. Additional studies were performed, and a diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Hepatic adenoma.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: CME at NEJM.org Dr. J. Sawalla Guseh: A 38-year-old man was evaluated at the cardiology clinic of this hospital because of exertional chest discomfort. The patient had been a competitive athlete in the past and had remained an avid runner. Approximately 15 years before the current evaluation, while he was running, he had episodes of flushing with diffuse cutaneous swelling involving the face, lips, hands, and trunk, along with hives on the abdomen and legs and associated dyspnea. The first episode occurred in autumn and the second episode the following summer. After the second episode, he lost consciousness while sitting on a bench. The next day, he was evaluated at an urgent care center. A Holter monitor was placed, and a transthoracic echocardiogram TTE was reportedly normal. The patient consulted with an allergist, who made a diagnosis of food-related exercise-induced anaphylaxis with reactions to soybeans, chickpeas, and tahini, on the basis of the foods he had eaten before these episodes and the results of radioallergosorbent testing. An epinephrine autoinjector was prescribed for use during future episodes, but the anaphylaxis symptoms did not recur. Approximately 4 months before the current evaluation, during a routine 5-mile jog, the patient had a new sensation that he described as my heart beating out of my chest. He rested, and the symptom subsided; he completed his run. One month later, during a bicycle ride, he had crampy discomfort in the anterior chest, which abated when he stopped cycling. Two weeks before the current evaluation, during a jog of several miles, he had cramping pain in the anterior chest on the left side that gradually escalated over a 5-minute period. He started walking, and the pain abated; he ran for an additional 20 minutes without a recurrence of pain. He sought an evaluation in the cardiology clinic of this hospital to determine the cause of his symptoms and the safety of continued vigorous exercise. On evaluation in the cardiology clinic, a review of systems was negative for dyspnea, recent syncope, orthopnea, edema, cough, hemoptysis, and recent allergic symptoms. The patient ran or cycled four times per week and had previously completed a marathon. His medical history included attention deficithyperactivity disorder. Five years earlier, an episode of syncope had occurred in the context of multiple episodes of nonbloody diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and chills. His surgical history included two colonic polypectomies, one 6 years before this evaluation and the other 1 month before this evaluation; pathological examination of the polyps had revealed lymphoid aggregates and hyperplastic polyps. The patient took no medications and reported no adverse reactions to medications. The patient worked in the financial sector and lived with his wife and children. He did not use tobacco, alcohol, or other substances. Multiple maternal relatives had had colon cancer, and an older brother had had colonic polyps removed in his fourth decade of life. There was a family history of hypertension. On examination, the blood pressure was 122/84 mm Hg measured in both arms, the heart rate 54 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. There were mild expiratory wheezes; the remainder of the examination was normal. An electrocardiogram ECG showed sinus bradycardia and anterior T-wave abnormalities, findings that had been observed on tracings obtained 5 years earlier during an evaluation for presyncope; a TTE obtained at that time had been normal. Sinus bradycardia and anterior T-wave abnormalities had not been observed on tracings obtained 15 years earlier Fig. 1A, 1B, and 1C. The white-cell count and platelet count were normal, as were blood levels of hemoglobin, electrolytes, calcium, and thyrotropin and results of renal-function tests. The high-sensitivity troponin level was 10 ng per liter reference range, 0 to 14. Plasma metanephrines were undetectable, and the normetanephrine level was normal. The next day, a TTE showed no abnormalities of cardiac chamber size and function and no evidence of valvular dysfunction. An ambulatory patch heart monitor, applied to evaluate cardiac rhythm over a 2-week period, revealed sinus rhythm without arrhythmia. A cardiopulmonary exercise stress test was performed; the patient exercised for 19 minutes 17 seconds according to a treadmill protocol that increased incrementally to maximal effort with a respiratory exchange ratio of 1.12 and a maximum heart rate of 181 beats per minute 99 of the age-predicted maximum. At peak effort, the stress test did not reproduce symptoms, and he stopped because of leg fatigue. An ECG showed 0.5-mm horizontal ST-segment depression in leads III, aVF, V3, and V6, along with isolated premature ventricular contractions. The ventila-tory efficiency was normal. Additional diagnostic testing was performed, and management decisions were made.

Bozym Medicine: A 49-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of hypokalemia and paranoid thoughts. Six months before the current admission, discomfort on the right side of the chest developed, and the patient was evaluated at another hospital. Dr. Mark C. Murphy: Computed tomography CT of the chest Fig. 1, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nodule in the upper lobe of the left lung that measured 2.1 cm by 1.9 cm, as well as bulky me-diastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. Dr. Bozym: An endobronchial ultrasoundguided transbronchial needle aspiration of a mediastinal lymph node was performed. Cytologic examination of the specimen revealed small-cell carcinoma. Five months before the current admission, the patient sought a second opinion in the oncology clinic of this hospital. The patient was counseled about the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer and the need for additional imaging before consideration of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy. Additional imaging was scheduled, along with a follow-up appointment. The patient did not undergo additional imaging and did not attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic of either this hospital or the other hospital. Six weeks before the current admission, the patient noticed swelling of both legs. Ten days before this admission, the swelling had not abated, and he was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient described himself as generally healthy and did not report any chronic health conditions. He reported no fever, chills, shortness of breath, or pain. Additional history was obtained from the patients brother. The patient had been pursuing alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer that included a strict diet and intravenous infusions, and he had not shared the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer with his family until several days earlier. The patients brother believed that the patient was in denial about the diagnosis. When the patient was 12 years of age, he had received a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, which had been treated with radiation therapy and splenectomy. Fifteen years before this presentation, ischemic colitis had been treated with small-bowel resection. One year before this presentation, deep-vein thrombosis had been treated with a 4-month course of anticoagulation. There was no history of psychiatric disease. He took no medications and had no known drug allergies; he did not disclose details about the infusions that he had received as alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer. The patient lived in a suburban area of New England with his parents. He was divorced and frequently visited his children. He worked part-time as a skilled tradesman. Family members reported that he was a lifelong nonsmoker. The temporal temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 167//95 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and appeared well, but he looked thinner than he had looked during his evaluation at the oncology clinic 5 months earlier. The abdomen had a healed surgical scar, and the legs had symmetric 1+ edema. The blood potassium level was 2.6 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.6 to 5.1); the white-cell count was 14,630 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis. Dr. Murphy: CT pulmonary angiography of the chest (Figure 2A and 2B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a marked increase in the size of the left-lung mass, which now measured 9.3 cm by 4.6 cm, as well as enlargement of the mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 2C), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed numerous new ill-defined rim-enhancing hepatic lesions, which measured up to 8.0 cm in diameter; an adrenal mass, which measured 4.1 cm by 3.4 cm; and thrombosis of the branches of the right portal vein. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was normal. Dr. Bozym: Supplemental potassium was administered intravenously and orally, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. During the next 3 days, additional supplemental potassium was administered. During follow-up interviews, the patient acknowledged the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer, but he did not explain why he had not shared the diagnosis with his family or provide details about the alternative treatment that he had pursued. On the fourth hospital day, the blood potassium level increased, and the patient asked to go home. He stated that he was willing to attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic, but he was evasive when chemotherapy and immunotherapy were discussed. The patient was discharged. One week after discharge, and 1 day before the current admission, the patient’s father accompanied the patient to receive massage therapy and an intravenous infusion as alternative treatment. During the infusion, the patient abruptly became volatile, agitated, and angry. On the drive home, he refused to close the window and stared into the distance. He stated that doctors had cast spells on him during his recent hospitalization and that he had killed his oldest child, which was not true. The next day, the patient borrowed his brother’s car without permission and drove across the state. After he returned home, family members brought the patient to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient stated that he was “embarrassed” for being in the hospital. He initially reported no symptoms, but on specific questioning, he acknowledged fatigue, weight loss, generalized weakness, decreased appetite, and ongoing leg swelling. He reported that he did not feel confused, afraid, or worried and that he had no suicidal or homicidal thoughts or auditory or visual hallucinations. Additional history was obtained from the patient’s family members. The patient had not slept for several days. His aggressive and erratic behavior and delusions were not typical, although he could become easily angered and had a long-standing belief that his doctors had administered radiation therapy for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma to make money. The temporal temperature was 36.4°C, the blood pressure 194/1/06 mm Hg, and the pulse 87 beats per minute. The patient alternated between being alert and lethargic, and he could state the names of his children but not their ages. He was cooperative but intermittently paused and stared; he was not distracted by external stimuli, but he seemed to be responding to internal stimuli. He spoke only a couple of words at a time and answered most questions by nodding or shaking his head. There was generalized weakness, which was most pronounced in the proximal muscle groups. The leg edema was unchanged, and the skin appeared abnormally tan; there was no scleral icterus, sublingual jaundice, or asterixis. The blood potassium level was 2.2 mmol per liter, the carbon dioxide level 37 mmol per liter (reference range, 22 to 32), and the ammonia level 51 μmol per liter (87 μg per deciliter; reference range, 12 to 48 μmol per liter [20 to 82 μg per deciliter]). The white-cell count was 13,530 per microliter. Urinalysis was normal, and urine and blood toxicologic testing was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, was normal. Supplemental potassium was administered intravenously and orally, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, the blood potassium level was 2.2 mmol per liter. A diagnostic test was performed.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. George Karandinos Medicine: A 76-year-old man was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of dizziness and altered mental status. On the day of the current evaluation, the patient was observed crawling on a city sidewalk. He appeared pale and diaphoretic. On evaluation by emergency medical services, he reported feeling dizzy and weird. A fingerstick blood glucose level was 152 mg per deciliter 8.4 mmol per liter. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient could not recall recent events, but he reported shortness of breath, as well as chronic back pain and persistent ringing in the ears. He was unable to give additional details of his history, but he provided the name of the hospital where he routinely received care. On a phone consultation, physicians at that hospital reported that the patient had a history of traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, seizure disorder, chronic back pain due to spinal stenosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and anxiety. Prescribed medications included lisinopril and transdermal lidocaine. There were no known drug allergies. The patient had consumed alcohol in the past but not for 40 years. His family history was unknown. The temporal temperature was 36.6C, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 1831/13 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 27 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient appeared disheveled and diaphoretic. He was somnolent but awakened to verbal stimuli. He was oriented to person, place, and time but only intermittently followed commands. A small superficial skin abrasion was noted above the left eyebrow. There was mild tenderness on palpation of the midback but no other evidence of trauma. The remainder of the examination was normal. Point-of-care ultrasonography, performed with an approach known as FAST focused assessment with sonography for trauma, showed no abnormalities. The blood ethanol level was undetectable, and urine toxicologic testing was negative for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, and opi-ates. The blood levels of lipase, magnesium, and N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide were normal, as were results of liver-function tests. There was mild normocytic anemia, but the complete blood count with differential count was otherwise normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing of a nasopha-ryngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Samples of blood and urine were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, intra-ventricular conduction delay, left axis deviation, and nonspecific minor ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Brooks P. Applewhite: Radiographs of the chest and pelvis showed no acute abnormalities. Computed tomographic CT angiography of the head and neck Fig. 1A revealed nonspecific mild white-matter changes, a nonspecific small focal calcification in the right-peritrigonal white matter, atherosclerosis without high-grade cere-brovascular stenosis, and multilevel spondylotic changes without severe spinal canal stenosis. There was no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarction. CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis Fig. 1B and 1C revealed no evidence of aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, lung consolidation, or pericardial effusion. There was a left adrenal nodule that measured 19 mm in diameter, a finding consistent with an adenoma. Dr. Karandinos: Normal saline with 5 dextrose was administered intravenously. During the next 8 hours, the patient was agitated and combative. He repeatedly removed peripheral intravenous catheters and disconnected monitors. He was no longer oriented to place or time. Two doses of olanzapine were administered intravenously, and the patient slept for several hours during the night. Sixteen hours after the patient arrived in the emergency department, the temporal temperature was 37.7C, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, the blood pressure 160/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while he was breathing ambient air. The patient was observed to be breathing deeply. He was able to state his name, but his speech was otherwise nonsensical and dysarthric. He followed commands only when visual cues were given; for example, he stuck out his tongue after the examiner demonstrated the task. Motor, sensory, and reflex examinations were normal; tests of cerebellar function were not performed. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The results of electroencephalography EEG were normal, without epi-leptiform abnormalities. Normal saline with potassium chloride was administered intravenously, as was lorazepam. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Applewhite: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head Fig. 2 revealed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute or sub-acute infarction. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed a mild burden of white-matter signal hyperintensities, which are nonspecific but typical of chronic small-vessel disease. The previously detected calcification in the right-peritrigonal white matter correlated with an 8-mm focus of T1 and T2 signal abnormalities with associated susceptibility blooming, a finding suggestive of either a calcified cavernous malformation or sequelae of previous infection or inflammation. Dr. Karandinos: The patients mental status did not improve. Twenty-four hours after he arrived in the emergency department, he was admitted to the hospital with a working diagnosis of seizure. The temporal temperature was 37.6C, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the blood pressure 151/70 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while he was breathing ambient air. Respiratory effort appeared increased. He was somnolent, and he followed simple commands but did not open his eyes in response to sternal rub. The blood levels of creatine kinase, fibrinogen, and ammonia were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Thiamine was administered intravenously. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Chronic salicylate toxicity. ", "prediction": "1.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Erin E. Mauney Pediatrics: A 16-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. The patient had been well until 5 weeks before this admission, when diarrhea and intermittent, diffuse, crampy abdominal pain developed. During the subsequent week, the diarrhea occurred more frequently, and the abdominal pain worsened in severity, such that it sometimes awoke the patient from sleep. Four weeks before this admission, the diarrhea began to contain dark-red blood. The patients mother took her to the primary care clinic of another hospital. In the primary care clinic, the weight was 98.7 kg; the physical examination was otherwise normal. The hemoglobin level was 12.5 g per deciliter reference range, 12.0 to 16.0. Stool cultures for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 were negative, as were antigen tests for giardia, cryptospo-ridium, and Clostridioides difficile toxin. Empirical treatment with ciprofloxacin was started. During the next 3 weeks, the patient completed the course of ciprofloxacin as instructed, but the abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea continued. On the day of this admission, diarrhea occurred at least four times. The patients parents called the primary care clinic and were instructed to bring her to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported fatigue, malaise, weight loss, decreased appetite, and intermittent nausea and vomiting when she ate food. She also had headache and mild, diffuse joint and muscle pain. She had had no fever or sick contacts. The patient had obesity, anxiety, and attention deficithyperactivity disorder ADHD. Medications included fluoxetine and dextroamphetamineamphetamine; there were no known drug allergies. Menarche had occurred when she was 11 years of age, and her last menstrual period had been 2 months earlier. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs, and she did not vape or smoke tobacco. The patient lived in a rural area of New England with her mother, father, and sister, as well as her pet dog, cat, and lizard. She attended a technical high school with an emphasis on agriculture, and she had frequent interactions with marine and farm animals through school. Her family history included colorectal cancer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in her maternal grandfather, diverticulosis in her maternal grandmother and mother, psoriasis in her maternal grandmother and uncle, and celiac disease in her paternal cousin. Her father had hyperlipi-demia, and her mother had had one miscarriage, which had occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.4C, the heart rate 112 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 94/68 mm Hg. The weight was 89.8 kg, and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 32.7. The patient appeared pale, tired, and uncomfortable because of pain. The mucous membranes were dry. The abdomen was nondistended, and there was mild tenderness in both lower quadrants. There was no ulceration or rash. The white-cell count was 10,690 per microli-ter reference range in children 12 to 17 years of age, 4500 to 10,700, the platelet count 188,000 per microliter, and the hemoglobin level 9.8 g per deciliter. The blood level of C-reactive protein was 248.0 mg per liter reference range, 0.0 to 8.0, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 71 mm per hour reference range, 0 to 20. The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, and ondansetron were administered, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. On hospital day 2, the hemoglobin level was 8.2 g per deciliter, and one unit of packed red cells was transfused. Esophagogastroduodenos-copy EGD and colonoscopy were performed. Dr. Maureen M. Leonard: On EGD, two cratered esophageal ulcers were located 30 cm from the incisors Fig. 1A. The proximal, middle, and distal portions of the esophagus were normal. Diffuse mild inflammation  characterized by erythema and friability  was found in the car-dia, gastric fundus, and gastric antrum Fig. 1B. The duodenum appeared normal. Biopsy specimens were obtained throughout the procedure for histologic evaluation. When the patient was being positioned on the procedure table for the colonoscopy, a large volume of bright-red blood was noted to be draining from the rectum. Perianal and digital rectal examinations did not reveal a source of bleeding. Emergency radiography of the abdomen did not reveal free air, and the colonoscopy was started. On colonoscopy, the rectum and proximal sigmoid colon appeared normal Fig. 1C. However, as the colonoscope was advanced farther into the sigmoid colon, multiple nonob-structing, large, friable, dark-violet lesions were identified and biopsied Fig. 1D, 1E, and 1F. Because of narrowing and severe friability, the area was not traversed with the endoscope, and the procedure was aborted. Dr. Mauney: The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit of this hospital. During the subsequent 2 days, an additional two units of packed red cells were transfused. Treatment with pantoprazole was started. Dr. Sjirk J. Westra: Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and chest was performed Fig. 2A through 2D. There was irregular thickening of the large bowel wall and adjacent fat stranding, with sparing of the distal sigmoid colon and rectum. The kidneys had multifocal patchy areas of hypoattenuation. Dr. Mauney: On hospital day 5, tachycardia and tachypnea developed. The hemoglobin level was 8.8 g per deciliter, and the platelet count was 67,000 per microliter. The prothrombin time was 17.3 seconds reference range, 11.5 to 14.5, the prothrombin-time international normalized ratio 1.4 reference range, 0.9 to 1.1, the activated partial-thromboplastin time 50.0 seconds reference range, 22.0 to 36.0, and the blood d-dimer level greater than 10,000 ng per milliliter reference range, 0 to 500. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Westra: Thoracic CT angiography revealed a central filling defect in the distal right pulmonary artery, a finding consistent with pulmonary embolism Fig. 2E. There was also a large right pleural effusion. Dr. Mauney: A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: CME at NEJM.org Dr. Esperance A. Schaefer: A 56-year-old man with a history of alcohol and opioid use was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital because of abnormal results on liver testing. Three years before the current presentation, the patient had elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase on routine testing performed by his primary care physician. At that time, he reported that testing for hepatitis C virus HCV antibodies had been positive in the past. The HCV RNA level was undetectable; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cessation of alcohol use was advised. Two years before the current presentation, the levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase had decreased; additional laboratory test results obtained at that time are shown in Table 1. Seven months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital because of pain and swelling in the left wrist that had lasted for 3 weeks. The temporal temperature was 36.6C. The volar aspect of the left wrist was erythematous and swollen, as was the left knee. Tests for Lyme disease antibodies and rheumatoid factor were negative. Radiographs showed subcutaneous edema of the left knee but no fracture, dislocation, or evidence of advanced arthropathy of the left knee or wrist. A 10-day course of pred-nisone was prescribed for presumed inflammatory arthritis. The joint swelling and pain resolved. Six months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the same emergency department because of a painful rash. The temporal temperature was 36.3C. The distal left forearm was erythematous and had scattered small subcutaneous nodules. Laboratory evaluation revealed pancytopenia, coagulopa-thy, and elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and uric acid were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A plain radiograph of the left wrist showed soft-tissue edema but no abnormalities of the bone. A second course of prednisone was prescribed, and the patient was referred to a dermatologist and a gastroenterologist for consultation. Two weeks later, the patient was evaluated by a dermatologist affiliated with the other hospital. He had multiple tan macules on the face and trunk, angiomas, and reddish-purple papules some 1 cm in diameter on the left forearm. A biopsy of a papule on the left forearm was performed. Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed nonspecific suppurative and granulomatous dermatitis. No microorganisms were identified, and culture of the biopsy specimen was negative. Four months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by a gastroenterologist affiliated with the other hospital. He had spider angiomas and fullness of the left upper quadrant. On a serum-based test for liver fibrosis FibroTest, he had a score of 0.96 with scores of 0.00 to 0.21 indicating no fibrosis and scores of 0.74 to 1.00 indicating severe fibrosis. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. William R. Bradley: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography MRCP revealed a nodular hepatic contour with patchy perfusion but no focal hepatic lesions Fig. 1A. Spleno-megaly, portal vein thrombosis with cavernous transformation, and perigastric, paraesophageal, and splenorenal collateral vessels were also identified Fig. 1B and 1C. There was no dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts; the common bile duct measured 8 mm in diameter Fig. 1D. Dr. Schaefer: Three months before the current evaluation, esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed. Grade 2 esophageal varices were identified and banded. Eight days later, the patient was admitted to a second hospital because of new confusion, lethargy, delayed and slurred speech, and visual hallucinations. The blood ammonia level was 99 mol per liter 169 g per deciliter; reference range, 11 to 60 mol per liter 19 to 102 g per deciliter. Urinalysis was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radio-graph was normal. Abdominal ultrasound images showed persistent splenomegaly and heterogeneous liver echotexture without ascites. A computed tomographic scan of the head, obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. An electrocardio-gram showed sinus bradycardia, a pattern consistent with incomplete right bundle-branch block, downsloping ST-segment depressions in the precordium, and a prolonged corrected QT interval. Treatment with lactulose was initiated for a working diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. Confusion resolved, and the patient was discharged home on the second hospital day with arrangements made for additional cardiac testing after discharge. One month before the current evaluation, an echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and function, mild right ventricular dilatation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation with right atrial dilatation, and an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 71 mm Hg. Perfusion images obtained during vasodilator stress testing showed no evidence of inducible left ventricular ischemia. The patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital for additional evaluation. In the gastroenterology clinic, the patient reported chronic dyspnea with exertion. He had no orthopnea, chest pain, or palpitations. He had consumed six beers daily for approximately 30 years but had not consumed alcohol during the previous 18 months. Three years before the current presentation, the patient had received a diagnosis of dyslipidemia, with a blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 337 mg per deciliter 8.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 129 mg per deciliter 1.8 to 3.3 mmol per liter and a total cholesterol level of 380 mg per deciliter 9.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 155 to 199 mg per deciliter 4.0 to 5.1 mmol per liter. He had a history of opioid use disorder, including intravenous opioids; the disorder had been in remission with the use of buprenorphinenalox-one. Other medical history included depression, insomnia, and multiple knee surgeries. In addition to buprenorphinenaloxone, medications included lactulose, omeprazole, and trazodone. Penicillin had caused a rash. He had worked as a laborer but was disabled and no longer working. He had smoked two cigarettes daily for 30 years. His family history included stroke in his father, diabetes in his mother, and rheumatoid arthritis in his sister. On examination, the heart rate was 73 beats per minute, the blood pressure 99/65 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 69.9 kg and the body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters 24.9. He was alert and oriented; asterixis was present. The lung fields were clear, and there was a grade 26 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border. Abdominal examination revealed a palpable hard mass in the epigastrium, a finding that indicated a probable firm caudate lobe of the liver. The knees had healed surgical scars, and there was no edema in the legs. A few spider angiomas were present on the chest. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Serologic testing was negative for antinuclear antibodies and was positive for antimitochon-drial antibodies, with a titer of 1:5120. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Primary biliary cholangitis with portopulmo-nary hypertension. ", "prediction": "1. Cirrhosis of the liver: The patient's history of chronic alcohol use, findings of splenomegaly, portal vein thrombosis, esophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy, and elevated liver enzymes all suggest advanced liver disease, likely cirrhosis.\n\n2. Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease: Although the HCV RNA level is undetectable, the history of HCV antibody positivity and elevated liver enzymes warrants consideration of previous HCV infection contributing to current liver pathology.\n\n3. Alcoholic liver disease: The patient’s long-term alcohol consumption and subsequent elevated liver enzymes, as well as recommendations for cessation, point towards alcohol as a significant contributor to liver damage.\n\n4. Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC): The presence of antimitochondrial antibodies and a high titer, along with liver enzyme abnormalities, are indicative of PBC.\n\n5. Hepatic encephalopathy: Elevated ammonia levels, confusion, lethargy, and resolution of symptoms with lactulose administration strongly suggest hepatic encephalopathy secondary to liver dysfunction.\n\n6. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): The findings of a palpable mass in the epigastrium, although it could be a firm caudate lobe, necessitate ruling out HCC given the patient’s background of cirrhosis and chronic liver disease.\n\n7. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): Dyslipidemia and a high body mass index hint at possible NASH, especially in a patient with a complex liver disease history.\n\n8. Rheumatoid arthritis: Despite negative rheumatoid factor, arthritis-like symptoms such as swollen and painful joints could suggest an atypical presentation or seronegative rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n9. Amyloidosis: The presence of a palpable liver, splenomegaly, and systemic symptoms such as chronic dyspnea raises consideration for amyloidosis, especially given the history of chronic inflammatory conditions.\n\n10. Cryptogenic liver disease: Given the complexity of the patient's liver disease history and the inconclusive results from many tests, an idiopathic or unknown etiology must be considered."}

Croughan Medicine: A 67-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of fever, myalgias, and one previous episode of vomiting. Nine months before this admission, the patient was admitted to another hospital with cough and shortness of breath, and coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19 pneumonia was diagnosed. He received remdesivir, dexamethasone, and supplemental oxygen, which was delivered through a high-flow nasal cannula. His clinical condition gradually improved, and he was discharged home with supplemental oxygen, which was to be administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. While the patient was recovering at home, cough persisted and shortness of breath worsened, despite treatment with prednisone. Two weeks after discharge from the hospital, organizing pneumonia was diagnosed. Pulmonary-function testing revealed a severe restrictive ventilatory defect with impaired gas exchange, and findings on computed tomography CT of the chest were consistent with organizing pneumonia superimposed on fibrotic interstitial lung disease. Treatment with pirfenidone and mycophenolate mofetil was initiated, and the dose of prednisone was increased. Despite the use of these treatments, there was no decrease in dyspnea; consequently, treatment with pirfenidone was stopped, and the dose of prednisone was tapered over the course of the 2 months before the current admission. Because of persistent severe dyspnea on exertion, the patient was listed for lung transplantation 2 weeks before the current admission. Two days before the current admission, myalgias and nausea developed, and an episode of vomiting occurred. The tympanic temperature, as measured by the patient at home, was 40.0C. There was also a slight increase in shortness of breath, and the patient began to administer supplemental oxygen at an increased rate of 5 liters per minute. One day before the current admission, a home test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 antigen was negative. The patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported a chronic dry cough that was unchanged. Other medical history included gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and prostate cancer that had been treated surgically 4 years before this admission. Medications included albuterol, calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, ipratropiumalbuterol delivered by nebulizer, mycophenolate mofetil, pantoprazole, prednisone, and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole. He had no known drug allergies. He drank three or four alcoholic drinks per week and was a lifelong nonsmoker. He lived in a rural area of New England on five acres of land with woods. He used well water at home, but he boiled drinking water before consumption. He owned a dog, and he spent time outdoors, including mowing the lawn 1 week before this admission. He had had mosquito bites but no known tick bites. He was retired from previous work as a welder. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.6C, the blood pressure 126/67 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 24.8. Respirations were slightly labored, and the patient spoke in short sentences. He was alert and oriented and answered questions appropriately. No oral thrush was present. There were crackles at the bases of both lung fields. There was no hepatospleno-megaly. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. Urinalysis results were normal. The blood level of 1,3-β-d-glucan was less than 31 pg per milliliter (reference value, <60), and the blood galactomannan index was 0.13 (reference range, 0.00 to 0.49). Tests for Lyme disease and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A respiratory viral panel that included testing for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids was negative. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Amita Sharma: Chest radiography revealed bilateral peripheral reticular opacities that were similar in appearance to those observed in studies obtained 7 and 9 months earlier and were consistent with the patient’s reported history of interstitial lung disease, with no new focal consolidation. CT of the chest (Figure 1), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed resolution of multifocal air-space opacities and new peripheral curvilinear opacity. There was peripheral reticulation that was unchanged from that seen in the studies obtained 7 and 9 months earlier, basilar-predominant architectural distortion, and traction bronchiectasis with evidence of honeycombing in the lung bases. There was a slight decrease in mediastinal lymphadenopathy as compared with the earlier studies and a single new paraesophageal lymph node on the right side. Dr. Croughan: Blood and urine cultures were obtained, and treatment with intravenous cefepime was initiated. Twelve hours after the patient presented to the emergency department, the temporal temperature was 38.8°C, the blood pressure 82//53 mm Hg, the pulse 78 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute. One liter of intravenous fluids was administered, and the blood pressure increased to 108//52 mm Hg. Owing to the patient’s acute illness, the dose of prednisone was increased, and he was admitted to the hospital. On hospital day 1, fever persisted; the maximum temporal temperature was 39.9°C. The blood pressure remained stable; treatment with intravenous vancomycin was added. On hospital day 2, pancytopenia developed, and the results of liver-function tests had worsened; laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood and urine cultures showed no growth. A diagnostic test was performed. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Human granulocytic anaplasmosis. ", "prediction": "1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever, myalgias, nausea, hypotension, and pancytopenia, sepsis is a leading possibility, particularly in the context of immunosuppressive therapy and recent hospitalization.\n2. Drug-induced cytopenias: The recent introduction of mycophenolate mofetil and pirfenidone and increased prednisone could be responsible for the patient's pancytopenia and systemic symptoms.\n3. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP): This opportunistic infection could explain the patient's persistent respiratory symptoms and is a risk due to the immunosuppressive treatment.\n4. Acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease: Progression or acute exacerbation of the underlying fibrotic lung disease might underlie the worsening respiratory symptoms and increased oxygen requirements.\n5. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation: The immunocompromised state could predispose the patient to CMV reactivation, causing systemic symptoms and potential pancytopenia.\n6. Toxoplasmosis: Exposure to potential sources (dog, rural living) and immunosuppression make toxoplasmosis a differential for fever and systemic symptoms.\n7. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection: Despite a negative viral panel, RSV or other viral pathogens might still explain the clinical picture in the context of immunosuppressed state.\n8. Acute bacterial pneumonia: This remains a differential due to the invariable presence of fever and shortness of breath, and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics suggests this consideration despite unremarkable imaging.\n9. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or other herpesvirus reactivation: Chronic immunosuppression may lead to EBV or other herpesvirus reactivation, causing systemic illness.\n10. Histoplasmosis: Given his rural living conditions and potential exposure to environmental factors, histoplasmosis is a possible fungal infection differential despite the patient's immunosuppression."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Scott B. Silverman: A 68-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of worsening confusion. The patient had a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease. A myocardial infarction had occurred 18 years before the current admission; atrial fibrillation had also been diagnosed at that time. He had taken warfarin for many years but had stopped taking it 10 years before this admission. Seven and a half weeks before the current admission, the patient presented to another hospital with aphasia. His score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 3, with scores ranging from 0 to 42 and higher scores indicating greater severity. The score of 3 was due to partial loss of the right visual field and mild-to-moderate aphasia and dysarthria. Computed tomography CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no abnormalities. CT angiography of the head and neck revealed calcified atherosclerosis along the arch of the aorta, the origin of the left vertebral artery, the intracranial portion of the left vertebral artery, the carotid bifurcations, and the cavernous portions of both internal carotid arteries; there was no hemodynamically significant stenosis. Treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel was initiated. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and the aphasia resolved on the second hospital day. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a few small foci of acute infarction involving the frontal lobes, the posterior limb of the right internal capsule, and the right middle cerebellar peduncle. There was also a small focus of remote petechial hemorrhage in the subcortical white matter of the left parietal lobe. Although continuous telemetry revealed no evidence of atrial fibrillation, the patients strokes were thought to be cardioembolic, resulting from atrial fibrillation. Treatment with aspirin was continued, clopidogrel was discontinued, and apixa-ban was started; previously prescribed antihypertensive therapy with amlodipine CME at NEJM.org and lisinopril was resumed. The patient was discharged home on the second hospital day. Four days after discharge, and 7 weeks before the current admission, the patient presented to the other hospital with transient mild aphasia. Results of CT of the head performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material and MRI of the head performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material were reportedly unchanged from the studies obtained 6 days earlier. The patients systolic blood pressure was less than 100 mm Hg, and his symptoms were thought to be due to hypoperfusion or recrudescence of symptoms from previous stroke. Treatment with amlodipine and lisinopril was stopped, and the systolic blood pressure increased. The patient was discharged home on the fourth hospital day. Three weeks after discharge, and 3.5 weeks before the current admission, the patients daughter noticed that the patient had confusion and lethargy, and she took him to the other hospital for evaluation. She reported that he had new urinary incontinence, unsteady gait, and withdrawn affect. MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new foci of acute infarction involving the centrum semiovale and corona ra-diata bilaterally. Dr. Javier M. Romero: CT of the chest Fig. 1A revealed diffuse emphysematous changes, including a spiculated mass 1.7 cm in diameter with perilesional rectilinear markings in the lower lobe of the left lung. CT of the abdomen Fig. 1B revealed an exophytic hyperdense mass 1.6 cm in diameter arising from the anterior cortex of the left kidney. Dr. Silverman: On the fourth hospital day, the patient was transferred to a rehabilitation facility with plans for an oncology evaluation after discharge. After 10 days at the rehabilitation center, he was discharged home. Three days after discharge from the rehabilitation center, and 1 week before the current admission, numbness and tingling in the right hand and forearm developed, and the patients daughter again took the patient to the other hospital. On examination, he had pronator drift of the right arm and dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing. MRI of the head revealed new foci of acute infarction involving the left thalamus, the subcortical white matter of the right frontal lobe, and the periventricular white matter on the left side, but there was no hemorrhage. Treatment with apixaban was stopped, and enoxapa-rin was started. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day. Five days after discharge, the patients daughter noticed that the patient had new difficulty with swallowing pills and worsening confusion, and she brought him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The patient was not able to provide additional history, but his daughter reported that his aphasia and difficulty with balance had worsened since discharge from the other hospital. Other medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Medications included enoxaparin, aspirin, atorvastatin, and met-formin. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburb of Boston and was retired. He had smoked cigarettes for 40 years, but he had recently decreased tobacco use from one pack per day to three cigarettes per day. He smoked marijuana occasionally, and he drank alcohol rarely. His father had had coronary artery disease with a myocardial infarction in the fourth decade of life. The temporal temperature was 36.6C, the blood pressure 158/75 mm Hg, the pulse 70 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 25.1. The patient was alert and interactive. He was able to answer orientation questions correctly, although he was slow to respond. His speech was fluent, with no paraphasic errors. He had some difficulty with following simple commands and was unable to follow complex commands. There was decreased activation of the right nasolabial fold with preserved wrinkling of the forehead. Prona-tor drift of the right arm was present, and there was mild hemiparesis on the right side. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and rheumatoid factor were normal, as were results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The hemoglobin level was 12.7 g per deciliter reference range, 13.5 to 17.5; the remainder of the complete blood count with differential count was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 15 mm per hour reference range, 0 to 13. The d-dimer level was 912 ng per milliliter reference value, 500. Urinalysis showed more than 100 white cells per high-power field reference value, 10. A test for lupus anticoagulant was negative, as were tests for antibodies against cardiolipin and 2-glycoprotein 1. Antinuclear antibodies were present at a titer of 1:160 in a speckled pattern. Blood specimens were obtained for culture. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Romero: CT angiography of the head and neck Fig. 1C, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed focal encephalomalacia within the left frontal corona radiata and right cerebral peduncle. Atheromatous changes had resulted in mul-tifocal mild narrowing of the cervical and intra-cranial arteries. MRI of the head Fig. 1D and 1E, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed numerous new small foci of acute infarction involving the centrum semiovale and corona radiata bilaterally, the left thalamus, the left internal capsule and lentiform nucleus, the left subinsular region, the medial right precentral gyrus, the anterior right frontal lobe, the superior frontal gyri, and the right temporal lobe. There were also several scattered patches of increased signal intensity in the periventricular and subcortical white matter on fluid-attenuated inversion rehospital, and intravenous heparin was administered. Transthoracic echocardiography performed on the second hospital day revealed a normal ejection fraction and no valvular vegetations or patent foramen ovale. Blood cultures showed no growth. A diagnosis and management decisions were made. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Paraneoplastic vasculitis of the central nervous system. ", "prediction": "1. Recurrent ischemic stroke: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation, previous strokes, and the new infarctions present on MRI, recurrent ischemic strokes are highly likely.\n2. Cardioembolic stroke: The patient's atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease make a cardioembolic stroke a significant possibility despite ongoing anticoagulation therapy.\n3. Small vessel disease: The presence of multiple small foci of infarction and white matter changes on imaging suggests chronic small vessel ischemic disease.\n4. Vascular dementia: Worsening confusion, memory problems, and multiple infarcts are indicative of vascular dementia due to cumulative cerebrovascular events.\n5. Transient ischemic attack (TIA): Episodes of transient aphasia and neurological symptoms could align with TIAs, especially in the context of fluctuating blood pressure and anticoagulation changes.\n6. Hypertensive encephalopathy: Given his history of hypertension and multiple strokes, hypertensive encephalopathy could contribute to his acute worsening confusion.\n7. Infective endocarditis: Although blood cultures are negative, a subacute presentation involving recurrent embolic events may still suggest infective endocarditis, particularly in the context of known cardiac issues.\n8. Paradoxical embolism: Despite a negative echocardiogram for patent foramen ovale, paradoxical embolism through an undetected atrial septal defect remains a consideration.\n9. Alzheimer's disease: The patient's progressive confusion and cognitive decline could indicate an underlying neurodegenerative condition such as Alzheimer's, exacerbated by strokes.\n10. Carotid artery disease: Imaging showed multifocal atheromatous changes which could contribute to cerebrovascular symptoms and acute infarctions due to embolization."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: CME Dr. Carolina Geadas Medicine: A 70-year-old man with a history of kidney transplantation was evaluated at this hospital because of multiple erythematous rashes that had developed during an admission for respiratory failure, pneumococcal bactere-mia, and kidney failure. Approximately 4.5 years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ANCAassociated vasculitis after he presented with progressive glomerulonephritis with kidney failure and new hemoptysis. The anti-myeloperoxidase antibody titer was 221.0 U reference value, 2.8. The patient underwent plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide and prednisone were administered. Hemodialysis was initiated. Two weeks later, ritux-imab was administered, and cyclophosphamide and prednisone were discontinued. During the next 4 years, his renal function did not improve, and treatment with rituximab and hemodialysis was continued. Four months before the current admission, the patient underwent transplantation of a kidney from a deceased donor with hepatitis C virus antibodypositive status. After the kidney transplantation, immunosuppressive therapy included a dose of basiliximab, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and tapering doses of prednisone. The patient had delayed graft function; the blood creatinine level decreased from approximately 4.00 mg per deciliter 354 mmol per liter immediately after transplantation to 1.50 mg per deciliter 133 mmol per liter 6 weeks later. Six days before the current admission, at a routine follow-up visit, the cre-atinine level was 1.33 mg per deciliter 118 mmol per liter. Four days before the current admission, the patient began to have central abdominal discomfort, nausea, anorexia, chills, and diarrhea with loose stools three times per day. During the next several days, he noticed decreased urine output and malaise, and he began to have rhinorrhea, cough, sinus congestion, and dyspnea. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. A review of systems was notable for palpitations and dizziness and was negative for fever, emesis, and hematuria. The patients brother had recently received a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19. The patients medical history was notable for vasculitis with end-stage kidney disease culminating in kidney transplantation, coronary artery disease with placement of a stent in the right coronary artery, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cholelithiasis with cholecystectomy, colonic polyps and diverticulosis, gout, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, hypothyroidism, sleep apnea, hernia with hernia repair, and spinal stenosis. Medications taken at home included mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, prednisone, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, valganciclovir, warfarin, aspirin, atorvastatin, levothyroxine, and cholecalciferol, as well as lorazepam as needed. Penicillin had caused anaphylaxis. The patient was a retired business owner and lived with family in Boston. He had a remote history of tobacco smoking that totaled 10 pack-years; he had quit smoking approximately 40 years earlier. He did not drink alcohol or use other substances. His family history was notable for diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease in his father and siblings. There was no known family history of kidney or autoimmune disease. The temperature was 36.4C, the heart rate 130 beats per minute, the blood pressure 109/56 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 84 while the patient was breathing ambient air, 92 while he was receiving oxygen through a nasal can-nula at a rate of 6 liters per minute, and 100 while he was receiving oxygen through a high-flow nasal cannula at a rate of 60 liters per minute. On examination, he appeared acutely ill and weak. He had bitemporal cachexia, dry oral mucosa, and increased work of breathing. Auscultation of the chest revealed tachypnea, diminished breath sounds and crackles in the lungs, and tachycardia. There was tenderness in the periumbilical area and the right lower quadrant, at the site of the kidney transplantation; the incision was well healed. Blood levels of lipase, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood and urine specimens were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram showed possible sinus tachycardia with right bundle-branch block. Vanco-mycin and cefepime were administered intravenously. Three hours after presentation, a test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 RNA was positive, and remdesivir and dexamethasone were administered intravenously. Dr. Joseph D. King: Radiography of the chest Fig. 1A revealed confluent basilar consolidation in the left lung and scattered patchy opacities in the right lung. Ultrasonography that targeted the renal allograft revealed normal renal parenchyma and a trace amount of adjacent free fluid. Doppler ultrasonography Fig. 1B through 1E showed patent vasculature with normal flow velocities but showed elevated renal arterial resistive indexes, which are suggestive of allograft dysfunction. Computed tomography CT of the chest Fig. 1F and 1G, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed confluent consolidation in the lower lobes of both lungs, with more extensive findings in the left lung than in the right lung, as well as patchy multifocal consolidative and ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes of both lungs and the middle lobe of the right lung. Concurrent CT of the abdomen and pelvis Fig. 1H, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was remarkable for only a trace amount of free fluid in the right lower quadrant, along the renal allograft. Dr. Geadas: The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit ICU of this hospital. Phenylephrine was administered intravenously. He could not be weaned from the high-flow nasal cannula; because he had increased work of breathing and tachypnea, tracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation initiated. Bronchoscopy revealed dark secretions in the lower lobe and lingula of the left lung. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae in four of four bottles. A blood test for cyto-megalovirus CMV DNA and a urine test for legionella antigen were negative, and serum levels of 1,3--d-glucan and galactomannan were undetectable. Azithromycin, cefepime, linezolid, amiodarone, furosemide, and vitamin K were administered intravenously, and valganciclovir and atovaquone were administered orally. A trans-thoracic echocardiogram showed low-normal ventricular function, atrial enlargement, and no valvular vegetations. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration was initiated. ANCA titers were undetectable. On hospital day 3, excoriation and erythema of the buttock and a purpuric plaque on the sacrum were noted Fig. 2A. Repeat CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no changes. Punch biopsy of skin on the right buttock was performed. The antibiotic regimen was transitioned to intravenous ceftriaxone. The following day, histologic examination of the skin-biopsy specimen revealed epidermal necrosis, with scattered apoptotic and necrotic keratinocytes and extravasated erythrocytes. No microorganisms were identified, and microbio-logic culture of the biopsy specimen was negative. Laboratory test results obtained on hospital day 4 are shown in Table 1. During the next 6 days, treatment with continuous venovenous hemofiltration and intravenous ceftriaxone was continued. The level of mechanical ventilation was reduced from mandatory provided breaths to spontaneous ventilation, and the mode was switched to pressure-support ventilation. Repeat blood cultures were negative. On hospital day 11, the patients respi-ratory status worsened; the fraction of inspired oxygen was increased, and a mandatory respiratory rate was reinstituted. Two days later, a new well-circumscribed pur-puric patch was noted on the abdomen Fig. 2B. The patch measured 5 cm in greatest dimension and had a hyperpigmented halo but had no fluctu-ance or crepitus. The next day, a similar-appearing lesion was noted on the right thigh. Laboratory test results obtained on hospital day 14 are shown in Table 1. Dr. King: Repeat CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed increased consolidative and ground-glass opacities in both lungs. Dr. Geadas: Ceftriaxone was discontinued, and vancomycin, cefepime, and liposomal ampho-tericin B were administered intravenously. A diagnosis and management decisions were made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Mucormycosis. ", "prediction": "1. COVID-19 pneumonia: The patient has a confirmed positive test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA with characteristic imaging findings of confluent consolidation and ground-glass opacities.\n2. Pneumococcal pneumonia: Blood cultures grew Streptococcus pneumoniae, a common cause of bacterial pneumonia, especially considering the patient's recent respiratory symptoms.\n3. Kidney allograft dysfunction: Elevated renal arterial resistive indexes observed on Doppler ultrasonography suggest potential dysfunction of the transplanted kidney, which could explain the decreased urine output.\n4. Opportunistic fungal infection: Given the patient's immunosuppressive therapy and prolonged critical illness, the possibility of a secondary opportunistic infection, such as fungal pneumonia, should be considered.\n5. Pulmonary embolism: The presentation of sudden dyspnea with hypoxemia and the need for high-flow nasal cannula oxygen support could suggest a pulmonary embolism, although no direct imaging evidence supports this.\n6. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection: Despite a negative initial CMV DNA test, this remains a consideration given the patient's symptoms and immunosuppressive status.\n7. Tacrolimus toxicity: The medications this patient is receiving, particularly tacrolimus, could cause nephrotoxicity contributing to graft dysfunction and altered mental status.\n8. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The described respiratory failure pattern, with severe hypoxemia and bilateral lung infiltrates, fits the clinical criteria for ARDS.\n9. Mycophenolate-associated gastrointestinal toxicity: The gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort) might be a side effect of mycophenolate mofetil.\n10. Recurrent ANCA-associated vasculitis: A history of ANCA-associated vasculitis and new skin lesions raise the possibility of a relapse, despite the suppression of ANCA titers."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Florence H. Porterfield Medicine: A 71-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of refractory hemolytic anemia. The patient, who had recurrent breast cancer and diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, had been in her usual state of health until 7 months before the current admission, when fatigue and dyspnea on exertion developed. She was reportedly evaluated by a cardiologist and a pulmonologist, but no cause for her symptoms was identified. Two months before the current admission, dyspnea on exertion worsened, palpitations and dizziness developed, and the patient presented to another hospital for evaluation. Laboratory studies revealed anemia, a low blood level of haptoglo-bin, and an elevated blood level of lactate dehydrogenase. The blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A peripheral-blood smear showed schisto-cytes. A direct antiglobulin test was negative, complement levels were reportedly low, and a low titer of cold agglutinins was present. Testing for antibodies against 2-glycoprotein I and cardiolipin was negative, as was a screening test for lupus anticoagulant. Nucleic acid amplification testing for SARS-CoV-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and other common respiratory viruses was negative. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood revealed no aberrant clonal population of cells and no evidence of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy that was unchanged from that observed on imaging performed 2 years earlier. Packed red cells were transfused, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. Treatment with glucocorticoids was initiated for a working diagnosis of Coombs-negative autoimmune hemolytic anemia. On the third hospital day, anemia persisted, and additional units of packed red cells were transfused. The blood pressure had increased from 118/62 mm Hg on admission to 150/60 mm Hg. Treatment with glucocorticoids was stopped, and treatment with captopril was initiated for a working diagnosis of scleroderma renal crisis. Blood testing for the level of ADAMTS13 activity was performed, and on the sixth hospital day, treatment with plasmapheresis was started for the possible diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocyto-penic purpura TTP. The patient underwent a total of six sessions of plasmapheresis during the first 2 weeks of the hospitalization. During the second week of the hospitalization, treatment with eculizumab was initiated. The patient received packed red-cell transfusions every 2 or 3 days for ongoing hemolytic anemia. The results of the blood test for activity of ADAMTS13 returned; the activity level was 65 reference value, 67, and treatment with plasmapheresis was stopped. During the third week of the hospitalization, treatment with eculizumab was continued, and treatment with rituximab was initiated; however, the patient still received packed red-cell transfusions every 2 or 3 days. During the fourth week of the hospitalization, weekly treatment with both eculizumab and rituximab was continued, and a 3-day course of intravenous immune globulin was administered. Despite this treatment, there was no reduction in hemolysis. During the fifth week of the hospitalization, the patient continued to receive packed red-cell transfusions every 2 or 3 days, and thrombocy-topenia developed. Treatment with glucocorti-coids was resumed, and treatment with twice-weekly injections of epoetin alfa was initiated. A biopsy specimen of the bone marrow reportedly showed hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and erythroid predominance. During the sixth week of the hospitalization, the need for red-cell transfusion persisted, treatment with cyclophosphamide was initiated, and the dose of captopril was increased. During the seventh week of the hospitalization, acute kidney injury AKI developed, and treatment with captopril and glucocorticoids was stopped. On the 50th hospital day, the patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation. On evaluation at this hospital, the patient reported nausea, poor appetite, and weight loss of 9 kg during the past 2 months. She also reported that her urine had appeared pink or cola-colored after each transfusion of packed red cells. Twenty-one years earlier, localized clinical stage T1cpN1aM0 according to the tumor nodemetastasis classification system, estrogen receptor ERpositive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2negative invasive lobular breast cancer of the left breast was diagnosed. She had been treated initially with lumpectomy, radiation, and adjuvant chemotherapy, as well as with tamoxifen for 5 years and letrozole for 2 years. Three years before the current admission, there was a locoregional recurrence of ER-positive breast cancer in her left axilla; a lymph-node biopsy was negative. Staging studies reportedly revealed mildly prominent mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes and several indeterminate hepatic and renal lesions. Biopsy of the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes was reportedly negative. The patient declined recommended chemotherapeu-tic treatment options for recurrent breast cancer and instead opted for surveillance imaging. Findings on magnetic resonance imaging, ultra-sonography, and mammography of the breasts, which had been performed 6 months before the current admission, were reportedly unchanged from previous imaging. She had not palpated any new breast lumps on self-examination. Three years before the current admission, systemic sclerosis associated with antibodies against RNA polymerase III was diagnosed. Sclerosis was limited to the skin, and the patient had not received any specific treatment. Other medical history included Sjogrens syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease, latent tuberculosis that had been diagnosed 30 years earlier and treated with isoniazid for 9 months, dyslip-idemia, and osteoporosis. Medications included exemestane, goserelin, calcium, cholecalciferol, pantoprazole, and rosuvastatin. The patient took no over-the-counter remedies or supplements. She was allergic to trimethoprimsulfamethoxa-zole, which had caused fever and hives. She drank alcohol rarely and did not use any other substances. She had smoked tobacco for 3 years but had quit 50 years before the current admission. The patient was married and lived with her husband in New England. She was retired from work in health care. Three of her sisters had had breast cancer in their seventh decades of life; there was no family history of hemolysis. On examination, the temperature was 36.3C, the blood pressure 162/98 mm Hg, the pulse 105 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 17. The patient was alert and oriented. There was jaundice and scleral icterus. She had a well-healed lumpectomy scar on the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. There was no cervical, supracla-vicular, or axillary lymphadenopathy. Mild skin thickening was present on the hands and feet, with subtly reduced skin mobility of the forearms and legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood level of creatinine was 2.87 mg per deciliter 254 mol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter 53 to 133 mol per liter, and the blood urea nitrogen level was 62 mg per deciliter 22 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter 3 to 9 mmol per liter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed 3 blood and 2 protein, without bilirubin, urobilinogen, glucose, ketones, leukocyte esterase, or nitrates; the specific gravity and pH were normal. Microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed 10 to 20 red cells per high-power field reference range, 0 to 2 and 3 to 5 white cells per high-power field reference value, 10, and there were muddy-brown casts without dysmorphic red cells. The total protein:creatinine ratio in a spot urine sample was 6.41 reference value, 0.15. A peripheral-blood smear was obtained. Dr. Robert Ta: The peripheral-blood smear Fig. 1 showed anisopoikilocytosis, 10 to 15 schistocytes per high-power field, teardrop cells, nucleated red cells, reticulocytes, and mature and left-shifted myeloid cells. Dr. Porterfield: Additional imaging studies were obtained, and a diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Breast cancer–associated thrombotic microangi-opathy. ", "prediction": "1. Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP): The presence of schistocytes on peripheral smear and increased lactate dehydrogenase levels suggest microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, which is characteristic of TTP.\n2. Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA): Despite the negative direct antiglobulin test, the patient's low haptoglobin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and chronic need for red cell transfusion suggest hemolysis that could be autoimmune in nature.\n3. Recurrent Breast Cancer with Bone Marrow Infiltration: Given the patient's history of recurrent breast cancer, marrow infiltration could cause pancytopenia and refractory anemia.\n4. Systemic Sclerosis-Associated Renal Crisis: The patient's systemic sclerosis and a history of high blood pressure with acute kidney injury point towards a possible scleroderma renal crisis causing microangiopathy and hemolysis.\n5. Chronic Kidney Disease: The elevated blood creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and proteinuria indicate a worsening chronic kidney condition, which could contribute to anemia.\n6. Sjogren's Syndrome with Autoimmune Cytopenias: The patient's known Sjogren's syndrome can be associated with autoimmune cytopenias, potentially contributing to the refractory hemolytic anemia.\n7. Drug-induced Hemolysis: Medications and previous treatments, including immunosuppressants and chemotherapy agents, could cause drug-induced hemolysis or impact marrow function.\n8. Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH): Ongoing hemolysis, spleen and liver involvement, and systemic inflammation could indicate HLH, especially considering the recurrent need for transfusions and treatment-resistant anemia.\n9. Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH): The patient's symptoms and hemolysis fit the profile of PNH, although initial flow cytometry was negative; this condition can sometimes be intermittent or evolve.\n10. Microscopic Polyangiitis: Considering the renal involvement, proteinuria, and systemic features, a small-vessel vasculitis like microscopic polyangiitis could present with hemolytic anemia and kidney injury."}

Ravicz Pediatrics: A 20-year-old man with bipolar disorder was transferred to this hospital because of hemoptysis and hypoxemia. Eleven months before the current presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Six weeks before the current presentation, he was taken to another hospital for evaluation of racing thoughts, generalized hyperactivity, and difficulty sleeping. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for treatment. During the admission, the patient was involved in an altercation and was struck on the left side of the chest; pain subsequently developed in that area. Five weeks before the current presentation, chest pain persisted, and nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite developed. The patient was transported from the psychiatric hospital to the emergency department of the other hospital for evaluation. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Teresa Victoria: Computed tomography CT of the chest Fig. 1A revealed ground-glass opacities in the left lower lobe. Dr. Ravicz: The patient was told that he had a pulmonary contusion and was transported back to the psychiatric hospital. The dosages of quetiapine and pali-peridone were increased. Four weeks before the current presentation, the patient had urticaria and intermittent nausea; a single dose of methylprednisolone was administered. Three weeks before the current presentation, the patient was discharged home. Ten days before the current presentation, chest pain continued, cough developed, and nausea increased in severity. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department of a second hospital. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Victoria: Radiography of the chest Fig. 1B revealed a consolidation in the left lower lobe and a left pleural effusion. Dr. Ravicz: A course of doxycycline was started for the treatment of presumed pneumonia, and the patient was discharged home. During the subsequent 6 days, the cough and chest pain abated. Four days before the current presentation, the course of doxycycline was completed. During the next several days, the cough increased in severity and became productive of yellow sputum with dark-red streaks, and shortness of breath developed; nausea also increased in severity. One day before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated again in the emergency department of the second hospital. On evaluation, the patient appeared ill and had difficulty breathing. The temporal temperature was 37.5C, the blood pressure 99/50 mm Hg, the heart rate 127 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 31 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The hemoglobin level was 11.3 g per deciliter reference range, 14.0 to 18.0 and the albumin level 1.3 g per deciliter reference range, 3.4 to 5.0. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests. Nucleic acid amplification testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was negative for in-fluenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coro-navirus 2. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood was obtained for culture, and additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Victoria: CT angiography of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed emboli of the right and left pulmonary arteries that extended into multiple segmental and subsegmental branches Fig. 2. There were wedge-shaped opacities without enhancement in the left upper and lower lobes, findings consistent with infarction. There were small pleural effusions that were larger on the left side than on the right side. Dr. Ravicz: Treatment with enoxaparin, vanco-mycin, and cefepime was started, and intravenous fluids were administered. The patient was admitted to the second hospital. On hospital day 2, the oxygen saturation decreased, and supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula. Blood cultures showed no growth. The patient was transferred to this hospital for additional evaluation and treatment. On admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The chest pain, cough, hemop-tysis, shortness of breath, and nausea continued. The patient reported fatigue and weight loss that had started after the injury to the chest. He had also noticed discoloration in his fingers that was associated with changes in temperature. There was no headache, abdominal pain, or joint pain. The patient had a history of asthma, migraines, and attention deficithyperactivity disorder. Bipolar disorder had been diagnosed when he was hospitalized for mania, grandiose thoughts, and paranoid delusions. Medications included queti-apine, paliperidone, and methylphenidate. Sulfa drugs and valproate had caused rash, nausea, and vomiting. The patient had previously been sexually active with female partners. He drank alcohol rarely and vaped marijuana frequently; he did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother, maternal aunt, paternal aunt, and paternal uncle had depression. On examination, the temperature was 38.6C, the blood pressure 89/40 mm Hg, the heart rate 121 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The right lung was clear on auscultation, but the left lung had diminished sounds. There was no abdominal tenderness, joint swelling, or rash. The patient had a flat affect, apathy, grandiose thoughts, poverty of speech and thought, and psychomotor retardation. There was no evidence of paranoia or hallucinations. The hemoglobin level was 8.7 g per deciliter and the albumin level 1.6 g per deciliter. Urinalysis revealed 2 blood and 3 protein; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Diagnostic tests were performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Systemic lupus erythematosus with membranous lupus nephritis. ", "prediction": "1.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Nathan C. Praschan Psychiatry: A 27-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of convulsions. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 years before this admission, when shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred. The episode lasted approximately 4 to 5 minutes and had been preceded by a sharp pain in the back of the head that radiated to the neck, blurred vision, palpitations, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. The patient did not seek evaluation, and no additional convulsive episodes occurred during the subsequent 20 months. Four months before this admission, while the patient was drinking alcohol at a party, his body suddenly became stiff, and he fell backward onto a table. Shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred for approximately 5 to 8 minutes. He had urinary incontinence but did not bite his tongue. Five minutes later, similar convulsions occurred. The patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. The results of computed tomography of the head were normal, as was an electroencephalogram EEG that was obtained over a period of 40 minutes. Treatment with levetiracetam was started. The patient was discharged home with a recommendation for follow-up evaluation at the neurology clinic of the other hospital. Three months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of the other hospital. He reported that despite the use of levetiracetam, convulsions occurred approximately once per week. The results of magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were reportedly normal. Treatment with lamo-trigine was started. There was no change in the quality or frequency of the convulsive episodes. One month before this admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues found him on the floor, and they witnessed shaking and clenching movements of the trunk, arms, and legs that lasted approximately 2 minutes. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of a second hospital for evaluation. At least two additional convulsive episodes occurred at the second hospital. During one episode, the shaking movements became less intense when the physicians hand was placed on the patients shoulder; the movements resumed at the previous intensity when the hand was removed. In addition, the patients eyes were closed. When the eyelids were opened manually, no nystagmus or gaze deviation was present. When the eyelids were released, the eyes shut forcefully and Bells phenomenon upward deviation of the eyes when closing occurred. The patient did not speak but was able to follow simple verbal commands, such as an instruction to squeeze the physicians hands. In between the convulsive episodes, there were intermittent rocking movements of the upper body and nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the hands, and the patient did not speak or follow commands. After several hours, the episodes stopped, and the patient was able to speak. Admission to the hospital was recommended; however, the patient declined because of work obligations and anxiety about being in the hospital. He was discharged home. During the subsequent month, the patient continued to take levetiracetam and lamotrigine. However, the convulsions increased in frequency to one to three times per week. On the morning before the current admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues noticed that he abruptly stopped speaking and began to have shaking movements of the arms and legs. Emergency medical services were called. On their arrival, the patients body was stiff, and there was twitching of the trunk, arms, and legs. No urinary or fecal incontinence or biting of the tongue had occurred. The patient was able to stand up from a chair and walk to the ambulance. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.2C, the blood pressure 111/56 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert but did not speak. His eyes were open, with a primary midline gaze and blinking in response to visual threat. His body appeared stiff, with the arms and legs straightened. There were intermittent nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the trunk, arms, and legs. The patient was able to follow complex commands and to move the arms and legs symmetrically and against gravity, but there was a delay in motor activation. The deep-tendon reflexes were normal. Extensive scarring from burns was present on the face, trunk, back, arms, and legs. Approximately 45 minutes after the tremulous movements had stopped, the patient was able to speak but with limited fluency. Additional history was obtained. He had been taking levetiracetam and lamotrigine as directed; however, 3 days before this evaluation, he had stopped taking these medications because he was unsure whether they were effective. That morning, he had felt well until he noticed a sharp pain in the back of his head that radiated to his neck, along with sudden blurred vision, full-body numbness, and difficulty concentrating. A convulsive episode then occurred that lasted up to 20 minutes; during the episode, the patient was aware of events but sometimes had difficulty hearing. He described his overall mood as pretty good and did not report decreased energy or chronic fatigue. There was no history of psychotic or manic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or obsessive or compulsive behaviors. The patient had a history of a febrile seizure in childhood, as well as several concussions that had occurred while he was playing sports in childhood. He reported that during the first 6 years of life, his social supports were limited, and he had experienced maltreatment by a family member; he did not elaborate on the nature of the maltreatment. In late childhood, he was involved in a house fire and hospitalized for a prolonged period because of severe burns on the face, body, arms, and legs. He had asthma, major depressive disorder, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD, and panic disorder with agoraphobia. He took escitalopram daily and loraze-pam as needed for panic attacks. He was in a long-term romantic relationship. He did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he smoked marijuana approximately once per year and drank one alcoholic beverage per week. His father had died of heart disease when the patient was a teenager; his mother had schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic epilepsy. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The blood lactate level was 2.4 mmol per liter 22 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter 5 to 20 mg per deciliter and the blood creatine kinase level 489 U per liter reference range, 60 to 400. Serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was admitted to this hospital. A diagnostic test was performed.

Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures (PNES): The intermittent nonrhythmic tremulous movements, ability to follow complex commands during episodes, and lack of abnormal findings on EEG suggest a psychological origin rather than a neurological one.\n\n2. Temporal Lobe Epilepsy: Despite normal EEG and MRI findings, the patient’s symptoms including convulsions and post-ictal confusion could still be consistent with a seizure disorder that may not always show detectable abnormalities on standard imaging.\n\n3. Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia: The patient's history of panic disorder could manifest as physical symptoms resembling convulsions, especially considering the stress and anxiety during episodes.\n\n4. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): Given the patient's prolonged psychological history and childhood trauma, PTSD can sometimes present with severe somatic symptoms such as convulsions.\n\n5. Conversion Disorder: Characterized by neurological symptoms like convulsions without medical or neurological basis, particularly given the history of trauma and increased frequency of episodes under stress.\n\n6. Focal Seizures with Secondary Generalization: The patient’s convulsions and sensory aura (sharp head pain radiating to the neck) are typical of focal seizures starting in one area and spreading across the brain.\n\n7. Alcohol Withdrawal Seizures: Though infrequent alcohol use was reported, the convulsive episodes occurring after consumption could indicate alcohol withdrawal contributing to the seizures.\n\n8. Syncope: The episodes of stiff body and blurred vision could represent syncope with convulsive movements, commonly mistaken for seizures, particularly when precipitated by pain or other stressors.\n\n9. Malingering: Intentional production or exaggeration of symptoms for secondary gain, though less likely, should be considered, especially if the patient's reported symptoms appear inconsistent with clinical findings.\n\n10. Myoclonic Seizures: Characterized by sudden, brief, involuntary twitching of muscles, which might explain the intermittent nature and distribution of the patient’s convulsive episodes."}

Hofacker Medicine: A 67-year-old man was admitted to this hospital with hypoxemia. Six years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated because of melena and anemia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed duodenal ulcers; biopsy of one of the ulcers revealed changes consistent with moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Computed tomography CT of the abdomen showed a locally invasive mass in the head of the pancreas. A diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarci-noma with metastasis to the duodenum was made, and treatment included chemotherapy, chemoradiation, and pancreaticoduodenectomy. Two months after the surgery, surveillance CT of the chest showed segmental pulmonary embolism in the right lower lobe. Treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin was recommended, but the patient declined. During the next 5 years, surveillance CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed every 6 months. Six months before the current presentation, CT of the abdomen showed a new mass in the sigmoid colon with associated nodularity and lymphadenopathy. Colonoscopy revealed two fungating, nonobstructing, medium-sized masses, one at the ileocecal valve and the other in the sigmoid colon. Biopsy was performed, and a diagnosis of mantle-cell lymphoma was established. The patient was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital, and plans were made for treatment with chemotherapy. Five months before the current presentation, pain in the right leg developed after a long car trip. Ultrasonography of the right leg revealed distal deep-vein thrombosis, and treatment with apixaban was initiated. Nine weeks before the current presentation, cycle 1 of rituximab, dexametha-sone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin R-DHAP chemotherapy was administered, along with filgrastim. In addition, the administration of acyclovir and tri-methoprimsulfamethoxazole was started for prophylaxis; however, rash developed on the trunk after 1 week, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole was replaced with atovaquone for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Six weeks before the current presentation, cycle 2 of R-DHAP chemotherapy was administered. Two days later, melena, fatigue, and dyspnea on exertion developed. Laboratory testing revealed anemia hematocrit, 26.8; normal range, 41.0 to 53.0. The patient received 2 units of packed red cells, and fatigue and dys-pnea resolved. Treatment with omeprazole was initiated. Four weeks before the current presentation, the administration of atovaquone was stopped because of the cost of the medication, and dapsone was started for prophylaxis against P. jirovecii pneumonia. Three weeks before the current presentation, cycle 3 of R-DHAP chemotherapy was administered. Ultrasonography of the right leg revealed resolution of the distal deep-vein thrombosis, and treatment with apixaban was stopped. Two weeks before the current presentation, fatigue and dyspnea on exertion recurred, but melena did not. Laboratory testing again revealed anemia hematocrit, 28.7, and the patient received 1 unit of packed red cells; fatigue resolved, but dyspnea did not. On the day of presentation, the patient was evaluated before the administration of cycle 4 of R-DHAP chemotherapy. He reported ongoing dyspnea on exertion but no cough, fever, chills, chest pain, or orthopnea. He had been having loose stools since the pancreaticoduodenectomy. Other medical history included hypertension and hereditary spherocytosis, which had been treated with splenectomy. Medications included acyclovir, dapsone, lisinopril, and omeprazole. Trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole had caused a rash; there were no other known drug allergies. The patient drank alcohol rarely; he had smoked tobacco for 2 years but had quit 20 years before this presentation. He was divorced, lived alone in a suburb of Boston, and worked as a lawyer. His mother had had breast cancer. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.6C, the blood pressure 134/82 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 92 while the patient was at rest and breathing ambient air, 88 to 90 while he was walking and breathing ambient air, and 93 while he was at rest and receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 25.4. The patient had tachypnea but no increased work of breathing. The lung sounds were normal, and the jugular venous pulse was not elevated. The legs had no edema. The blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of coagulation, kidney-function, and liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA was negative, as was a respiratory viral panel. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: CT pulmonary angiography of the chest Fig. 1, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed filling defects in the right upper lobe and both lower lobes, findings consistent with pulmonary emboli. Subtle tree-in-bud and ground-glass opacities were present in the upper lobes. Scattered pulmonary nodules were present bilaterally; they were stable in size as compared with nodules observed on previous imaging studies. The main pulmonary artery measured 2.6 cm in diameter proximal to bifurcation. Dr. Hofacker: Cycle 4 of R-DHAP chemotherapy was delayed. Treatment with intravenous hepa-rin was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, the oxygen saturation was 91 while he was at rest and receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia. ", "prediction": "1. Pulmonary embolism: Given the patient's history of segmental pulmonary embolism, recent CT angiography findings of pulmonary emboli, and ongoing dyspnea, this is the most likely cause of hypoxemia.\n\n2. Recurrent pancreatic cancer metastasis: Recurrence of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with pulmonary metastasis could explain stable pulmonary nodules and hypoxemia.\n\n3. Chemotherapy-induced lung injury: The patient's chemotherapy regimen, which includes high-dose cytarabine and cisplatin, can cause direct lung toxicity leading to hypoxemia.\n\n4. Mantle cell lymphoma metastasis: Lymphoma can metastasize to the lungs, potentially causing ground-glass opacities and hypoxemia.\n\n5. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia: Despite prophylaxis with dapsone, immunocompromised patients undergoing chemotherapy are at risk for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, which can lead to significant hypoxemia and characteristic imaging findings.\n\n6. Deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism: Although recent ultrasonography showed resolution of DVT, new or recurrent DVT could still be a source of pulmonary embolism causing hypoxemia.\n\n7. Drug-induced lung disease: Previous reactions to medications and recent changes in prophylactic regimens could have precipitated a hypersensitivity pneumonitis or other drug-induced lung disease.\n\n8. Acute exacerbation of chronic anemia: The patient's recurrent anemia and low hematocrit levels can contribute to hypoxemia and dyspnea, especially under stress from recent chemotherapy.\n\n9. Infection other than COVID-19: Subtle tree-in-bud and ground-glass opacities suggest the possibility of a bacterial or atypical pneumonia, even though initial viral panels were negative.\n\n10. Congestive heart failure: Though less likely given the absence of other symptoms and physical findings, CHF can present as hypoxemia and should be considered in a patient with extensive medical history.\n\n"}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Chidiebere D. Akusobi Medicine: A 44-year-old woman was evaluated in the rheu-matology clinic of this hospital because of proximal muscle weakness and myalgia. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 5 years before the current presentation, when morning stiffness and pain developed in the small joints of both hands. Laboratory evaluation reportedly revealed elevated blood levels of anticyclic citrullinated peptide CCP antibodies and rheumatoid factor, as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Rheumatoid arthritis was diagnosed, but the patient chose not to begin specific therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Instead, she began taking selenium, cod-liver oil, and turmeric as home remedies for joint pain. Morning stiffness and joint pain resolved after 4 weeks. Four years before the current presentation, treatment with hydroxychloroquine was started after the occurrence of another episode of morning stiffness and pain in the small joints of the hands. Three years before the current presentation, treatment with hydroxychloroquine was stopped after melasma developed. Treatment with methotrexate was initiated, but morning hand stiffness and pain recurred; methotrexate was replaced with leflunomide, and the symptoms in the hands subsequently decreased. Six months before the current presentation, the patient began to have myalgia in the arms and thighs, as well as generalized fatigue. She had difficulty raising her arms above her head, and she could no longer independently brush her hair or apply makeup. Myalgia worsened with exercise and was worst at the end of the day. The patient reported episodes of tingling in the hands and feet, but she had no stiffness or pain in the small joints of her hands. Three months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by a local rheumatologist and laboratory testing was performed. The blood level of creatine kinase was 422 U per liter reference range, 40 to 150 and the lactate dehydrogenase level 509 U per liter reference range, 110 to 210. Antinuclear antibodies ANA were detected at a titer of 1:320 in a nuclear homogenous pattern, CME at NEJM.org and antiU1-ribonucleoprotein U1-RNP antibodies were present. The blood levels of C3 and C4 were normal, and testing for antidouble-stranded DNA dsDNA and anti-Smith antibodies was negative. Two months before the current presentation, treatment with azathioprine was started, and the patient was referred to the rheu-matology clinic of this hospital. In the rheumatology clinic, the patient reported ongoing myalgia and tingling in the hands and feet but had noticed an improvement in her ability to raise her arms above her head after starting treatment with azathioprine. Two weeks earlier, episodes of muscle spasms in the hands and fingers had developed; massage of the hands had been performed to relax the spasms. The patient had a history of Graves disease, which had been complicated by ophthalmople-gia and had been treated with methimazole for 2 years, followed by radioactive iodine ablation 11 years before this presentation; hypothyroidism had developed after radioactive iodine ablation therapy. Other history included latent tuberculosis infection, which had been treated with a 3-month course of isoniazid and rifampin, and hypoparathyroidism that had developed 9 years before this presentation. Medications included azathioprine, levothyroxine, calcium supplements, and calcitriol; the patient was unsure of the formulation and dose of calcium supplementation. She lived outside the United States and traveled intermittently to Boston for specialized medical care. She lived with her mother and worked in information technology. She drank alcohol occasionally, smoked cigarettes, and used no illicit drugs. A sibling had systemic lupus erythematosus SLE. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.3C, the blood pressure 145/70 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. She had mild exophthalmos in both eyes. There was an area of hyperpigmentation on the face. The joints had a normal range of motion without tenderness on palpation; there was no synovitis. Neck flexion was mildly weak, as was hip flexion; strength was otherwise normal, as was sensation. There was no rash. The remainder of the examination was normal. Diagnostic tests were performed, and management decisions were made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Hypocalcemic myopathy due to hypoparathy-roidism. ", "prediction": "1. Polymyositis: The presence of proximal muscle weakness, elevated creatine kinase levels, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase are suggestive of an inflammatory myopathy such as polymyositis.\n2. Dermatomyositis: Although less likely due to the absence of skin rash, the patient's symptoms could still be consistent with dermatomyositis, which also presents with proximal muscle weakness and elevated muscle enzymes.\n3. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): Given her family history and the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-U1 RNP antibodies, SLE is a potential diagnosis despite the lack of organ involvement typically seen in SLE.\n4. Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD): The presence of anti-U1 RNP antibodies, combined with symptoms overlapping those of lupus, polymyositis, and rheumatoid arthritis, suggests MCTD.\n5. Hypothyroid myopathy: Although the patient is on levothyroxine, her history of hypothyroidism could still be contributing to her muscle weakness and myalgia.\n6. Drug-induced myopathy: The use of drugs like azathioprine and leflunomide, both of which can have myopathic side effects, makes this a consideration.\n7. Inclusion body myositis: The chronic onset of muscle weakness and involvement of both proximal and distal muscles could suggest inclusion body myositis.\n8. Peripheral neuropathy: The tingling in her hands and feet associated with hypothyroidism and possibly drug side effects could point towards a peripheral neuropathy.\n9. Sjogren's syndrome: The presence of dry symptoms and anti-U1 RNP antibodies in the context of muscle weakness could suggest Sjogren's syndrome with associated myopathy.\n10. Electrolyte imbalance: Given her history of hypoparathyroidism and calcium supplementation, imbalances in calcium or magnesium could contribute to muscle spasms and weakness."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. John C. Schell Medicine: A 25-year-old woman with a history of acute intermittent porphyria was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain and jerking movements of the right arm and leg. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 2 days before this admission, when diffuse abdominal pain and nausea developed. She also felt confused and agitated, and a rash developed on her chest. One day before this admission, four episodes of jerking movements of the right arm and leg occurred, and the patient was concerned that she was having seizures. She presented to another hospital for evaluation. At the other hospital, the patient reported that the symptoms were consistent with her previous flares of acute intermittent porphyria. She reported that jerking movements of the right arm and leg had occurred 5 minutes before her arrival at the hospital and had caused jaw dislocation; she also reported that the rash on her chest had become painful. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable. The mental-status and neurologic examinations were reportedly normal. The jaw was dislocated to the left, and there was diffuse abdominal tenderness. Intravenous morphine, diphenhydramine, and ondansetron were administered; an infusion of dextrose was started; and the dislocated jaw was manually reduced. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. The next day, the severity of pain in the abdomen and rash increased. Transfer to this hospital was requested because of a shortage of hemin at the other hospital. On evaluation at this hospital, the patient described intense pain in the abdomen, a painful rash, and persistent nausea, agitation, and confusion. She was worried that she might have seizures, have blistering of the skin, or die because the hemin infusion had been delayed. Additional history was obtained from the patient. She had a history of obesity, anxiety, and chronic pain that had been attributed to acute intermittent porphyria. She reported that acute intermittent porphyria had been diagnosed 13 years before this admission, when abdominal pain, jerking movements of the right arm and leg, and a painful rash developed during menarche. During the 13 years before this admission, one or two flares of CME at NEJM.org acute intermittent porphyria had occurred each year; during the 6 months before this admission, no flares had occurred. Two previous flares of acute intermittent por-phyria had been treated with a hemin infusion. During the first hemin infusion, the patient had a reaction that was characterized by intense yelling and writhing in pain, and intubation was performed to complete the infusion. Before the second hemin infusion, she received intravenous methylprednisolone and underwent elective intubation to prevent a reaction. The patient identified heat, stress, and menses as triggers for acute intermittent porphyria flares. Medications included intravenous diphenhydra-mine and dextrose, which were administered daily through a central-venous-access port in the right side of the chest. The patient had previously taken intravenous morphine daily; however, she had not had access to this medication for approximately 3 months because of an inability to transport it from her home in the United Kingdom. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and penicillin had caused anaphylaxis, prochlorperazine had caused flushing, metoclo-pramide had caused anxiety, and fentanyl had caused altered mental status. The patient was born in New England and had moved to the United Kingdom 15 years earlier. She was a student in a graduate program at a university in the United Kingdom and had returned to New England to visit her family. She did not use alcohol or illicit drugs, and she did not vape or smoke cigarettes. Her mother had dementia, and her father had died years earlier from an unknown cause. Her maternal grandmother had acute intermittent porphyria. Her immediate family had undergone genetic testing for acute intermittent porphyria; her brother was an asymptomatic carrier of a pathogenic variant, and her six other siblings were not carriers. On examination, the temperature was 36.3C, the blood pressure 144/90 mm Hg, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97 while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared older than her stated age. She was awake, alert, and oriented. She was frustrated and irritable, with pressured speech. A port in the right side of the chest was palpated. Tenderness in the abdomen was diffuse but was worst in the right upper quadrant. Erythematous plaques and excoriations were present on the arms and chest and under the breasts. The neu-rologic examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The hemoglobin level was 10.6 g per deciliter reference range, 12.0 to 16.0 and the platelet count 120,000 per microliter reference range, 150,000 to 400,000. A urine specimen was obtained for measurement of the urinary porphobilinogen PBG and porphyrin levels, but the amount of urine was inadequate. Oral acetaminophen and intravenous morphine, di-phenhydramine, lorazepam, and ondansetron were administered. Infusions of dextrose and hemin were started, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. During the subsequent 2 days, the hemin infusion was continued, but the patients symptoms did not abate. On the second hospital day, an additional urine specimen was obtained; the urinary PBG level was 0.3 mol per liter reference range, 0.0 to 1.3 and the uroporphyrin level 4 nmol per liter reference range, 0 to 30. On the third hospital day, the patient reported worsening jerking movements of the right arm and leg, which she believed had caused jaw dislocation. On examination, the jaw was dislocated to the left. She did not cooperate with a manual reduction, and a surgical reduction of the jaw was performed. A diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Factitious disorder. ", "prediction": "1. Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP): Given her history of AIP and the classic presentation of abdominal pain, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and increased urinary porphyrins during episodes, this is the most likely diagnosis.\n2.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Aaron R. Kaufman Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear: A 31-year-old man was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of redness of the right eye. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 days before the current evaluation, when he noticed an itchy perianal rash and rectal pain. After 2 days, the symptoms did not abate, and he sought evaluation in the urgent care clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported the perianal rash and gradually increasing rectal pain. He had been sexually active with two male partners in the previous month. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7C, the blood pressure 117/84 mm Hg, and the pulse 80 beats per minute. Three scattered, tender, shallow ulcers and a vesicle were present in the perianal area. No rectal discharge or fissures were seen. Tender inguinal lymphadenopathy was present bilaterally; there was no cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus HIV infection, gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and orthopoxvirus infection were performed. Empirical treatment with valacyclovir was started. The patient was discharged home with instructions to await the test results. Two days before the current evaluation, test results were available. The test for HIV types 1 and 2 was nonreactive, as were the tests of urinary and rectal specimens for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acids. The blood test for treponemal antibodies was positive; the results of rapid plasma reagin RPR testing were not yet available. Polymerase-chain-reaction PCR testing of a swab specimen obtained from the perianal vesicle detected the presence of nonvariola orthopoxvirus DNA. Species-specific real-time PCR testing confirmed the presence of mpox virus MPXV; formerly known as monkeypox virus, clade II. The patient was called and instructed to return to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported a new rash on his chest, abdomen, and back that was similar to the perianal rash. He reported new fever, chills, fatigue, malaise, and headache. There was no weight loss, sore throat, or cough. Numerous scattered, tender, shallow ulcers were present on the chest, abdomen, and back, in addition to five tender, um-bilicated pustules and one shallow ulcer in the perianal area Fig. 1. Treatment with tecoviri-mat was started. The patient was discharged home with instructions to follow up in the sexual health clinic of this hospital. During the next 2 days, the patient took teco-virimat. On the day of the current evaluation, he called the sexual health clinic because of redness and throbbing, pressurelike pain of the right eye. He was instructed to return to the emergency department of this hospital. On the current evaluation, the patient reported that redness and discomfort of the right eye had started after he had been discharged from the emergency department and had increased in severity and become painful during the subsequent 2 days. He rated the pain at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He did not have blurry vision, photopho-bia, flashing lights, or floaters. There were no symptoms in the left eye. Since the initiation of antiviral therapy, the fever, chills, and headache had resolved, and the rectal pain had decreased in severity. There was no rhinorrhea or cough. The patient had a history of syphilis, which had occurred 5 years earlier and had been treated with intramuscular penicillin G. Since receiving the diagnosis of mpox, he had learned that syphilis and mpox had been diagnosed in one of his sexual partners from the previous month. Medications included tecovirimat and valacyclovir. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England and worked in the food-service industry. He did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He did not know his family history. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.4C. The uncorrected visual acuity was 2020 in each eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, without a relative afferent pupillary defect, and extraocular movements were full. The intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg in the right eye and 17 mm Hg in the left eye normal range, 10 to 21. When proparacaine drops were administered to check the intraocular pres-sure, the pain in the right eye did not decrease in severity. There was mild tenderness on palpation of the right globe under the closed eyelid. Slit-lamp examination revealed mild meibomian-gland dysfunction in both eyes; there was no eyelid edema or erythema. The right conjunctiva was diffusely injected, with severe bulbar hyperemia Fig. 2A. The right caruncle was boggy and erythematous. On eversion of the eyelids, small-to-medium-sized follicles and tarsal con-junctival petechiae were observed on the right lower and upper lids Fig. 2B and 2C. The left conjunctiva was normal. The cornea, anterior chamber, iris, and lens appeared normal in both eyes. Dilated funduscopic examination was performed. The vitreous, optic nerve, retinal vascu-lature, macula, and periphery appeared normal in both eyes. A diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Mpox conjunctivitis. ", "prediction": "1. Mpox-related ocular involvement: Given the patient’s history of confirmed mpox infection and the timing of the eye symptoms following systemic symptoms, mpox-related ocular involvement is the most likely diagnosis.\n\n2. Viral conjunctivitis: The redness, discomfort, and diffuse injection of the right conjunctiva could be indicative of viral conjunctivitis, especially considering the patient's recent viral infection.\n\n3. Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) keratitis: Although the patient is on valacyclovir, HSV keratitis remains a possibility given the severe pain and ocular findings, including conjunctival injection and tarsal conjunctival petechiae.\n\n4. Molluscum contagiosum: The presence of umbilicated pustules on the patient's skin raises the possibility of molluscum contagiosum, which can cause ocular manifestations, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.\n\n5. Secondary syphilis: Considering the patient’s history of syphilis and a positive treponemal antibody test, secondary syphilis could present with ocular manifestations such as conjunctivitis or uveitis.\n\n6. Allergic conjunctivitis: The symptoms of itching, redness, and discomfort could also be due to an allergic reaction, although this is less likely given the severity of the symptoms.\n\n7. Acute iritis: The severe ocular pain and tenderness on palpation, along with the history of systemic symptoms, make acute iritis a potential differential diagnosis.\n\n8. Bacterial conjunctivitis: Though less likely given the lack of discharge, bacterial conjunctivitis could be considered, especially if there is a secondary bacterial infection on top of the viral infection.\n\n9. Toxoplasmosis: The history of being sexually active and having pets could put the patient at risk for toxoplasmosis, which can have ocular involvement, though the current symptoms are more external.\n\n10. Behçet's disease: The presence of multiple ulcers and severe ocular symptoms raises the possibility of Behçet's disease, which can present with recurrent oral and genital ulcers and uveitis."}

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 weeks before the current evaluation, when he began to have an abnormal tingling sensation in the toes that he described as pins and needles. Over the course of several days, the par-esthesia extended to the feet. Six weeks before the current presentation, episodes of headache that lasted approximately 5 minutes and affected the left periorbital region began to occur on a daily basis. The headaches became less severe after the patient took acetaminophen. He had no associated nausea, vomiting, or neck pain. Two weeks before the current presentation, paresthesia developed in the fingertips and, over the course of several days, extended to the hands and then the forearms. One week before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. The temporal temperature was 36.9C, the blood pressure 134/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while he was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 25.9. He had no rash. Sensation to light touch and pinprick was absent from the toes to the midfoot. Screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses, and Lyme disease were negative. The blood level of folate was greater than 20 ng per milliliter 45 nmol per liter; reference value, 4.6 ng per milliliter 10 nmol per liter, the vitamin B1 thiamine level 149.1 nmol per liter reference range, 66.5 to 200, and the vitamin B12 cobalamin level 235 pg per milliliter 173 pmol per liter; reference range, 232 to 1245 pg per milliliter 171 to 919 pmol per liter. Testing for antimyelin-associated glycoprotein antibodies was negative. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Saurabh Rohatgi: Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head Fig. 1 was performed. T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, obtained before the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed mild, nonspe-cific, scattered foci of hyperintensity involving the supratentorial white matter; the dominant lesion, which was located in the right frontal centrum semiovale and corona radiata, measured 1.4 cm in diameter. No associated abnormal enhancement was seen on images obtained after the administration of contrast material. Dr. Pullarkat: The patient was referred to a neurology clinic. One week later, while the patient was awaiting an appointment in the neurology clinic, paresthesia extended into the thighs and torso. The patient was advised by his primary care physician to present to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported worsening paresthesia and loss of dexterity in his hands. He was no longer able to play guitar. He had no motor weakness, bowel or bladder incontinence, or double vision. There was no change in sensation in his face or in articulation of his speech, and he had no dysphonia, dysphagia, or shortness of breath. Other medical history included depression and chronic knee and ankle pain after trauma. Medications included bupropion and mirtazapine. There were no known allergies. The patient was a graduate student and lived with several roommates. He was sexually active with women. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 11 years before quitting 4 years before the current presentation. He had consumed three alcoholic drinks daily for many years, but 1 month before the current presentation, he had reduced consumption to two drinks one or two times per week. He used intranasal cocaine three or four times per week and inhaled nitrous oxide once per week. He had last used lysergic acid diethyl-amide and ketamine 10 weeks before the current presentation during a camping trip in rural New England; there were ticks in the area where he had camped, but he had not found any ticks on his body. The patient had a normal diet with no dietary restrictions, and there was no history of diarrhea or unintentional weight loss. His maternal grandfather had diabetes, and his paternal grandfather had gastric cancer. The patient was alert and interactive and followed commands. The temporal temperature was 36.5C, the blood pressure 131/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96 while he was breathing ambient air. He had a flat affect but was oriented to time, place, and person. Speech was fluent with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. Cranial nerve examination was normal. Muscle tone and strength were normal. In the legs, there was reduced sensation to pinprick and to tempera-ture that extended from the toes to the hips and flanks, with sparing of the anterior trunk and the back. In the arms, there was reduced sensation to pinprick and to temperature that extended from the fingers to the shoulders. The reduced sensation was most pronounced in the fingers and toes. Vibratory sensation and proprioception were decreased below the shins. The reflexes were 2 in the arms but were absent in the legs. The patient was able to touch the tip of his nose with his index finger when his eyes were open but was unable to do so when his eyes were closed. His gait was unsteady, and the Romberg test was positive. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Functional vitamin B12 deficiency from use of nitrous oxide. ", "prediction": "1. Guillain-Barré Syndrome: Progressive paresthesia ascending from toes to torso, loss of reflexes, and unsteady gait are consistent with an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.\n2. Vitamin B12 Deficiency: The patient’s borderline low vitamin B12 level, coupled with paresthesia and decreased proprioception, may suggest subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord.\n3. Chronic Alcohol Use Neuropathy: History of heavy alcohol consumption could lead to peripheral neuropathy presenting with paresthesia and decreased vibratory sensation.\n4. Nitrous Oxide Use: Weekly use of nitrous oxide can result in subacute combined degeneration leading to sensory disturbances and impaired proprioception.\n5. Multiple Sclerosis: MRI findings of white matter hyperintensities combined with sensory symptoms could indicate demyelinating disease.\n6. Diabetic Neuropathy: Family history of diabetes and progressive sensory loss in a stocking-glove distribution might make diabetic neuropathy a consideration.\n7. HIV Neuropathy: Despite a negative screening test, HIV can sometimes present with peripheral neuropathy, as initial serological tests might miss early infection.\n8. Lyme Disease: The patient's history of a camping trip in a tick-prone area raises the possibility of an undetected Lyme disease-related neuropathy.\n9. Amyloidosis: Systemic conditions like amyloidosis can present with peripheral neuropathy and should be considered, especially with a progression over weeks.\n10. Paraneoplastic Syndrome: Unrecognized malignancies can present with paraneoplastic neuropathies, and thus a thorough screening for occult malignancies is warranted."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Abigail L. Donovan: A 13-year-old boy with a history of attention deficithyperac-tivity disorder ADHD, borderline personality disorder, and major depressive disorder was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of worsening depression, thoughts of self-injurious behavior, and suicidality. The patient had a history of impulsivity and frequent episodes of self-injury, such as head-butting and cutting, which sometimes occurred while he was in treatment settings. Twelve months before the current presentation, he began to have suicidal ideation, with occasional suicidal planning and a suicide attempt. During the next year, the patient had 10 evaluations in the emergency department and six inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations. One day before the current presentation, the patient was discharged from an inpatient psychiatric hospital, where he had been admitted and treated for 3 weeks because of urges to hurt himself. On the day of the current presentation, the patient visited his middle school and participated in therapy at home. Throughout the day, he noticed worsening depression and had recurrent thoughts of self-injury and suicide. He asked his parents to call emergency medical services because he felt unsafe in his home. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival, the patient was in an agitated and combative state, reporting that he had changed his mind and no longer wanted to be in the hospital. Attempts at verbal deescalation were not effective. Treatment with intramuscular olanzapine was administered, and physical restraints were placed on his arms and legs. During the next 6 hours, the agitation decreased, and the physical restraints were removed. Additional history was obtained but was limited because the patient shrugged his shoulders in response to most questions. He described the school visit as difficult and uncomfortable. He did not indicate why he felt unsafe in his home; he reported that he had picked at scabs on his arms and legs in order to hurt himself and had ongoing suicidal ideation. The patient also reported difficulty sleeping and concentrating, as well as loss of interest and motivation, although he still enjoyed playing sports. He had no homicidal ideation, paranoid thoughts, or delusions. Medications included extended-release guan-facine and lurasidone. The patient had no known drug allergies. He did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He lived in an urban area of New Hampshire with his mother, father, and sister. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.4C, the blood pressure 133/78 mm Hg, the heart rate 76 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared disheveled. There were scattered cuts and wounds in varying stages of healing on both arms. The patient was in a disengaged and agitated state. He had a depressed mood, a guarded affect, and difficulty concentrating. His speech was slow and soft, with reduced prosody. His thought process was logical and linear; the thought content was notable for suicidal ideation. He had no loosening of associations, delusions, or hallucinations. Insight and judgment were poor. The patient was deemed to be at high risk for harm and was transferred to the acute psychiatric service of the emergency department. Transfer to an inpatient psychiatric hospital was requested, but no beds were available at any facility in the region. During the next 6 weeks, while the patient was awaiting admission to an inpatient psychiatric hospital, treatment with extended-release guanfacine and lurasidone was continued, and treatment with sertraline, diphen-hydramine, and melatonin was initiated. He had frequent episodes of agitation, which led to the administration of oral clonidine or oral or intramuscular olanzapine as needed. He also had several episodes of self-injury; surveillance was heightened, with well-being checks performed every 15 minutes. On day 41 in the acute psychiatric service of the emergency department, agitation developed, and a dose of oral olanzapine was administered in addition to scheduled medications. One hour later, agitation continued, and a dose of intramuscular olanzapine was administered. After the administration of intramuscular olanzapine, the temporal temperature was 36.4C, the blood pressure 119/65 mm Hg, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The next morning, the blood pressure was 146/87 mm Hg and the heart rate 52 beats per minute. There were no new symptoms; the examination was unchanged. Twelve hours later, the blood pressure was 69/39 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute. The patient reported malaise and lightheadedness with standing, as well as nausea and abdominal pain. He appeared pale, tired, and lethargic. Oral rehydra-tion was encouraged. One hour later, the blood pressure was 94/50 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute. Three hours after the onset of hypotension, the blood pressure was 79/45 mm Hg and the heart rate 85 beats per minute. Blood and urine toxicologic screening was negative. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A blood specimen was obtained for culture. Intravenous fluids, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone were administered. Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no abnormalities. The patient was admitted to the pediatric medical service of this hospital. A diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Intentional guanfacine overdose. ", "prediction": "1. Adverse reaction to olanzapine: The timing of the symptom onset after olanzapine administration suggests a possible adverse drug reaction leading to hypotension.\n2. Orthostatic hypotension: The patient's report of lightheadedness with standing indicates a potential issue with blood pressure regulation.\n3. Sepsis: Given the hypotension and the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, an infectious etiology must be considered despite initial negative cultures.\n4. Adrenal insufficiency: Symptoms of nausea, malaise, and hypotension could suggest an underlying adrenal crisis, particularly in a stressed patient.\n5. Dehydration: The history of oral rehydration and significant hypotension hints at possible inadequate fluid intake or excessive loss.\n6. Sertraline-induced hypotension: The addition of sertraline, an SSRI, could have contributed to the patient's hypotensive episode.\n7. Functional or psychogenic hypotension: Considering the patient's psychiatric history, a psychogenic component to the hypotensive episode cannot be ruled out.\n8. Autonomic dysregulation: The patient's multiple psychiatric diagnoses and medication use could contribute to a dysfunction in autonomic regulation.\n9. Cardiac dysrhythmia: Despite normal heart rate readings, an underlying transient arrhythmia might explain the fluctuating blood pressure.\n10. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although CT findings were normal, the presence of abdominal pain and nausea necessitates considering a possible GI bleed affecting hemodynamics."}

Erdil Medicine: A 58-year-old woman was evaluated in the infectious disease clinic of this hospital because of fatigue, abdominal bloating, and eosino-philia. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 8 months before the current evaluation, when she fell and injured her right leg while hiking in a rain-forest in the Democratic Republic of Congo DRC. Before this injury, she had been traveling throughout the DRC for 1 month. She had hiked, walked barefoot, and gone swimming in freshwater lakes and rivers. Approximately 55 hours after the fall, the patient was transported to the trauma center of a regional hospital. Imaging studies revealed fractures of the right tibia with associated hemorrhage. Packed red cells were transfused, and an external fixation device was placed. Once the patients condition was stable, she was transferred to a hospital in the United States. At the second hospital, the eosinophil count was 3530 per microliter reference range, 0 to 400; the eosinophil count had been normal 18 months earlier. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. One week after the fall, open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture was performed. The patient started physical therapy and was discharged home. The patient had persistent weight gain and mild fatigue, which had developed 4 years before the current presentation. She had associated these symptoms with the onset of menopause. However, after the traumatic leg injury, she noticed that the symptoms increased in severity. One month before the current evaluation, the patients weight had increased by 8.6 kg since the leg injury, and she took a 1-hour nap every afternoon because of fatigue. In addition, she had new abdominal bloating that did not abate with the use of probiotics. The patient sought evaluation at a clinic associated with the second hospital. On evaluation, the results of blood tests for thyroid, kidney, and liver function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes. A test for Lyme disease was negative. The results of testing for Epstein Barr virus EBVspecific antibodies and other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Two weeks before the current evaluation, the patient moved to New England and established care in the primary care clinic of this hospital. She continued to receive physical therapy for rehabilitation of the right leg. She reported that the weight gain, fatigue, and abdominal bloating had worsened at a rapid rate; her weight had increased by 13.6 kg since the leg injury. The patient was referred to the infectious disease clinic of this hospital. The patient had a history of chronic migraines and hyperlipidemia. Review of systems was notable for mild cough and swelling of the right knee that began after the surgery. She had no fever, hot flashes, night sweats, headache, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, myalgias, arthralgias, or rash. Current medications included levothyroxine and probiotics. There were no known allergies. The patient had previously traveled to the southwestern United States, North and East Africa, western Europe, and South and Southeast Asia. She currently lived in a suburban area of New England with her husband and cats in a house that had mold. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. On examination, the temperature was 36.1C, the blood pressure 98/66 mm Hg, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 24.9. She appeared well. The lungs were clear on auscultation, and the abdomen was soft and nontender; there was no hepato-megaly or lymphadenopathy. The right knee and leg had healed surgical scars. The skin examination was normal. The eosinophil count was 1760 per microliter. Tests for syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and strongyloidiasis were negative. The urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Vincent V. Dinculescu: Computed tomography CT of the chest and abdomen Fig. 1, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed calcified, nonenlarged subcarinal lymph nodes, along with calcified lesions in the right lung, liver, and spleen, findings suggestive of granulomatous disease. There was also a low-attenuation hepatic lesion measuring 1.6 cm in diameter, which was probably a cyst. Dr. Erdil: A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Mansonella perstans infection. ", "prediction": "1. Parasitic infection (Strongyloides stercoralis or Paragonimiasis): Considering the patient's history of travel to endemic areas and eosinophilia, a parasitic infection is highly likely despite initial negative tests.\n2. Chronic eosinophilic leukemia: The persistent eosinophilia can sometimes indicate a hematologic malignancy even in the absence of typical systemic features.\n3. Drug-induced eosinophilia: Levothyroxine or other medications could potentially trigger eosinophilia, contributing to her symptoms.\n4. Tuberculosis (TB): The presence of calcified lesions in lungs, liver, and spleen accompanied by eosinophilia may suggest a past or dormant TB infection.\n5. Fungal infection (Histoplasmosis): Given her residence in a house with mold and calcified lesions in her imaging, a fungal infection like histoplasmosis could be a potential cause.\n6. Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism: Although thyroid tests were normal, intermittent fluctuations might not be captured, and thyroid dysfunction can cause weight gain and fatigue.\n7. Adrenal insufficiency: Symptoms of fatigue, weight gain, and abdominal bloating combined with eosinophilia could point towards adrenal gland dysfunction.\n8. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS): Persistent and unexplained fatigue, weight gain, and other somatic symptoms might align with CFS.\n9. Autoimmune disorder (e.g., Churg-Strauss Syndrome): Eosinophilia along with nonspecific symptoms like fatigue and weight changes warrants evaluation for systemic autoimmune conditions.\n10.

Nestor Medicine: A 19-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of respiratory failure. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 weeks before the current presentation, when pain developed in the right shoulder and the right flank. She was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital and was discharged home after testing for kidney stones and appendicitis was reportedly negative. Two weeks before the current presentation, dyspnea with exertion and nonproductive cough developed. Six days after the onset of dyspnea and cough, the patient departed on a vacation cruise with her family. During the 8-day trip, dyspnea and cough worsened and prevented her from participating in activities such as swimming and hiking. By the end of the cruise, she had severe dyspnea with walking, and she required the use of a wheelchair during her trip home. After returning to Massachusetts, she presented to the emergency department of the other hospital for evaluation. The patient reported ongoing cough and progressively worsening dyspnea but no chest pain or hemoptysis. The temporal temperature was 37.1C, the heart rate 132 beats per minute, the blood pressure 133/47 mm Hg, the respiratory rate more than 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88 while she was breathing ambient air. She appeared ill and had increased work of breathing. A murmur was heard on cardiac examination; other details of the examination are not available. An electrocardiogram ECG reportedly showed sinus tachycardia and lateral and precordial T-wave inversions. Urinalysis results and blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; the blood level of N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide NT-proBNP was 24,913 pg per milliliter reference range, 5 to 125. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Computed tomography CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material according to a pulmonary embolism protocol, report-CME at NEJM.org edly revealed pericardial and pleural effusions and multifocal lung opacities but no evidence of pulmonary emboli. Point-of-care ultrasonogra-phy reportedly revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25, marked aortic regurgitation, and a possible aortic-root abscess. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a high-flow nasal cannula. Treatment with intravenous furo-semide, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithro-mycin was started. The patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit of this hospital. On arrival at the cardiac intensive care unit, the patient received bilevel positive airway pressure. A family member accompanying the patient provided additional history. The patient had had intermittent back pain beginning 6 months before the current presentation. Two months before the current presentation, she had had asymptomatic infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2. Five weeks before the current presentation, she had had a dental cleaning. During the cruise, the patient had two episodes of diarrhea without fever or chills; the family member did not know whether other persons on the cruise had been ill. The patient had told her family that she had noticed visible pulsations in her chest during the 2 weeks before the current presentation, and the family member reported that the patients breathing had appeared labored while she was sleeping. Other medical history included anxiety and anemia. The patient took supplemental iron and had no known drug allergies. She did not use alcohol, tobacco, or other substances. She lived with her family in Massachusetts and worked in child care. There was no family history of cardiac or autoimmune disease. The temporal temperature was 36.8C, the heart rate 118 beats per minute, the blood pressure 145/58 mm Hg in the right arm and 136/65 mm Hg in the left arm, the respiratory rate 48 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was receiving bilevel positive airway pressure fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.70. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 21.6. While the patient was sitting in an upright position, she had increased work of breathing and intermittent cough. The heart rhythm was tachycardic, with a grade 26 systolic murmur at the base and a grade 34 decrescendo diastolic murmur at the base that radiated to the apex, without an S3 gallop. Carotid and subclavian bruits were present. The jugular venous pressure was 8 cm of water. There were rales and decreased breath sounds in both lungs. Brachial, ulnar, radial, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulses were symmetric. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, thyrotropin, lipase, human chorionic gonadotropin, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of tests of liver function and kidney function. A urine toxicology screening test was negative. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 77 mm per hour reference range, 0 to 20, and the blood level of C-reactive protein was 147.8 mg per liter reference value, 8.0; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Tests for SARS-CoV-2 and human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 were negative. Dr. Eric M. Isselbacher: An ECG Fig. 1A showed sinus tachycardia, a borderline rightward axis, poor R-wave progression in leads V1 through V4, and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Transthoracic echocardiography Fig. 1B through 1F and Videos 1, 2, and 3, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org revealed a mildly dilated left ventricle with diffuse hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 34. The aortic valve was tricuspid, without evidence of vegetation or aortic-root abscess, but there was incomplete closure of the aortic valve, which resulted in severe aortic regurgitation. The ascending thoracic aorta was dilated, measuring 44 mm in diameter, with thickened walls. The dilated left ventricle caused tethering of the mitral valve, which resulted in mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation and mild left atrial enlargement. There was a moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of cardiac tamponade. Dr. Vinit Baliyan: CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis Fig. 2 showed an irregular aortic contour with narrowing of the lumen in the vessels of the aortic arch and in the right renal artery. This imaging was performed with ECG gating, which allowed for the assessment of the aortic root. There was no evidence of a perivalvular abscess. However, circumferential wall thickening was present in the aorta at the root and in the ascending segment. In addition, there was circumferential wall thickening in partially visualized proximal vessels of the aortic arch and in the abdominal aorta. The mural thickening of the aorta showed enhancement that was suggestive of active inflammation; this enhancement was most visible in the abdominal aorta. Other findings included cardiomegaly with a markedly dilated left ventricle, alveolar pulmonary edema, a small pericardial effusion, and bilateral small pleural effusions. Dr. Nestor: A diagnosis and management decisions were made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Takayasu’s arteritis. ", "prediction": "1. Aortic dissection: Given the patient's severe aortic regurgitation, dilated ascending thoracic aorta, and circumferential aortic wall thickening, an aortic dissection is highly probable.\n2. Takayasu arteritis: The patient's age, circumferential thickening and narrowing of the aorta and its branches, and elevated inflammatory markers suggest large-vessel vasculitis, such as Takayasu arteritis.\n3. Infective endocarditis: The recent dental cleaning, heart murmur, and elevated inflammatory markers raise the possibility of infective endocarditis despite the absence of vegetations on echocardiography.\n4. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: The echocardiographic findings of severe aortic regurgitation, left ventricular dilatation, and hypokinesis indicate decompensated heart failure.\n5. Pericarditis: Moderate pericardial effusion and elevated inflammatory markers could suggest pericarditis, potentially contributing to the patient's symptoms.\n6. Pulmonary embolism: Despite negative CT findings for pulmonary embolism, it remains a consideration given the patient's acute onset of dyspnea and hypoxemia.\n7. Acute myocarditis: The patient's recent past infection with SARS-CoV-2 and elevated inflammatory markers make acute myocarditis a differential to consider.\n8. Post-viral syndrome: The patient's recent SARS-CoV-2 infection could be responsible for ongoing systemic symptoms due to post-viral syndrome.\n9. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): The multisystem involvement, including cardiac, pulmonary, and potentially renal systems, warrants consideration of SLE.\n10. Rheumatic heart disease: The presence of multiple valvular abnormalities, especially in a young patient, may point toward sequelae of undiagnosed rheumatic fever."}

Okonkwo Neurology: An 80-year-old man was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital because of left foot drop. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 5 years before the current presentation, when he first noticed that he needed to lift up his left leg while walking in order to prevent the toes of his left foot from dragging on the ground. During the next 2 years, his ability to dorsiflex the left ankle decreased progressively. Three years before this presentation, he began to use an anklefoot orthosis. One year before this presentation, the patient was evaluated in a neurology clinic affiliated with another hospital. He reported left foot drop, as well as occasional falls that he attributed to poor balance. Examination reportedly revealed wasting in the muscles below the left knee, weakness with attempts at dorsiflexion and eversion of the left ankle, loss of pinprick sensation to the midshins in both legs, and decreased vibratory sensation in the toes of both feet. The blood levels of cobalamin, folate, thyrotropin, and glycated hemoglobin and the results of serum protein electrophoresis were reportedly normal. Tests for syphilis and antinuclear antibodies were negative, as were blood tests for antibodies to sulfate-3-glucuronyl paragloboside and myelin-associated glycoprotein and a serum paraneoplastic autoantibody panel. The blood creatine kinase level was 456 IU per liter reference range, 30 to 194 and the aldolase level 5.8 U per liter reference value, 8.1. Imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head was reportedly normal. MRI of the lumbar spine reportedly revealed diffuse disk bulging with facet hypertrophy at multiple levels, which was contributing to mild spinal stenosis. Needle electromyography EMG of the left leg reportedly showed changes consistent with moderate-to-severe, subacute-to-chronic radiculopathy at L5 and S1 on the left side. The patient declined further workup at that time. One year later, his symptoms had not resolved, and he presented to the neurology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation. On the current evaluation, the patient reported stable left foot drop and mild low-back pain without radiating symptoms. He had no bowel or bladder changes, CME at NEJM.org no double vision or hearing changes, and no difficulty with breathing, chewing, or swallowing. His medical history included hypertension, dys-lipidemia, and adenocarcinoma of the prostate, which had been treated with local radiation therapy 4 years before this presentation. Medications included aspirin, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, metoprolol, and simvastatin. The patient was married, resided in New England, and was retired from work in the insurance industry. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 30 years but had quit smoking 30 years before this presentation. He drank four alcoholic drinks per day. His sister had breast cancer, and his father had died in his 70s from esophageal cancer. On examination, the blood pressure was 140/60 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 26.1. He had a step-page gait pattern with prominent left foot drop. He could not walk on his left heel, but he was able to walk on his left toes and to walk with a tandem gait. There was mild facial weakness, which was present on both sides but was more prominent on the right side, with an asymmetric smile and weak eye closure and cheek puffing. The optic disks had sharp margins. The pupils were round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements were full. There was no weakness or atrophy of the jaw, palate, or tongue. Hearing was grossly intact. Shoulder shrug was asymmetric, with less rise on the right side. A motor examination revealed wasting of the shoulder girdle, which was more prominent on the right side, and wasting of the calves. Tone was mildly decreased throughout, and there were no fasciculations. There was severe scapular winging, which was present on both sides but was more prominent on the right side. There was no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia. Strength was assessed according to the Medical Research Council scale, which ranges from 0 no visible muscle contraction to 5 normal strength. On the right and left sides, strength was 4 and 4, respectively, on shoulder abduction; 5 and 3 on ankle dorsiflexion; 4 and 4 on big-toe extension; 5 and 4 on ankle inversion; and 5 and 4 on ankle eversion. On both sides, strength was 4 on hip flexion and was normal on neck flexion and extension, elbow flexion and extension, wrist flexion and extension, finger extension and abduction, thumb abduction, hip abduction, knee flexion and extension, and plantar flexion. Deep-tendon reflexes were 1 at the biceps, 1 at the triceps, trace at the brachio-radialis, 2 at the knees, and not elicited at the ankles. Plantar responses were flexor. There was loss of pinprick and temperature sensations to the midshins in both legs, as well as decreased vibratory sensation to the ankles. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Karen A. Buch: MRI of the lumbar spine Fig. 1 revealed a large, leftward, eccentric disk herniation at L5 and S1 that impinged on the exiting L5 nerve roots, with greater impingement on the left side than on the right side. There was narrowing of the left subarticular zone and left lateral recess that encroached on the descending left S1 nerve root. Facet hypertrophy and ligamentous infolding at multiple levels were contributing to mild central spinal stenosis. Dr. Okonkwo: Additional testing was performed, and a diagnosis was made.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. ", "prediction": "1. Lumbar Disk Herniation: The left-foot drop, as well as MRI findings of a large, leftward, eccentric disk herniation at L5 and S1 impinging on the exiting L5 nerve roots, suggest a diagnosis of lumbar disk herniation.\n2. Chronic Lumbosacral Radiculopathy: The EMG findings showing moderate-to-severe subacute-to-chronic radiculopathy at L5 and S1 levels on the left side support this diagnosis.\n3. Common Peroneal Nerve Palsy: Given the progressive weakness in dorsiflexion and eversion of the left ankle, an isolated common peroneal nerve injury is a possible diagnosis.\n4. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS): The presence of muscle wasting, widespread weakness, scapular winging, and both upper and lower motor neuron signs raise the possibility of ALS.\n5. Peripheral Neuropathy: The bilateral loss of pinprick and temperature sensation below the midshins and decreased vibratory sensation in the toes are indicative of a peripheral neuropathy.\n6. Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease: This hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy could explain the progressive muscle wasting, sensory loss, and foot drop seen in the patient.\n7. Alcoholic Neuropathy: The patient's significant alcohol intake raises the possibility of alcoholic neuropathy, which can cause both motor and sensory deficits.\n8. Inclusion Body Myositis: The patient’s asymmetric weakness, particularly in the quadriceps and finger flexors, along with age, place this degenerative muscle disease in the differential.\n9. Multifocal Motor Neuropathy: Characterized by asymmetric muscle atrophy and weakness without significant sensory loss, this condition could explain some of the patient’s symptoms.\n10. Spinal Muscular Atrophy: Although typically presenting in younger individuals, adult-onset forms can exhibit progressive muscle wasting and weakness as seen in this patient."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Gregory M. Cote: A 52-year-old man with a metastatic solitary fibrous tumor was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia. The patient had been in his usual state of health until approximately 1.5 years before the current admission, when dysuria and pain in the lower abdomen and left leg developed after a motor vehicle accident. At another hospital, magnetic resonance imaging MRI reportedly revealed an incidental 14-cm necrotic mass in the pelvis, anterior to the bladder. Biopsy of the mass was reportedly diagnostic of a solitary fibrous tumor. The patient was referred to the multidisciplinary oncology clinic of this hospital. Computed tomography CT of the chest, performed for staging, revealed two 9-mm nodules in the left lung. The patient was treated with a 3-month course of dacarbazine chemotherapy and concurrent radiation therapy targeting the pelvic mass, and then he underwent surgical resection of the pelvic tumor, including partial cystectomy and placement of a ureteral stent. Pathological examination of the resected specimen Fig. 1 confirmed the diagnosis of spindle-cell sarcoma with features consistent with a dedifferentiated solitary fibrous tumor. Immuno-histochemical staining of the resected specimen revealed signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 STAT6 and CD34 in the tumor cells. Stereotactic radiation therapy for the lung nodules was also administered. However, metastatic disease progressed in the lungs, chest, bladder, and right leg. Over the subsequent 12-month period, the patient underwent serial treatment with four different chemotherapeutic regimens: pazopanib, doxorubicin with olaratumab, gemcitabine with docetaxel, and vinorelbine. Palliative radiation therapy for a painful leg metastasis was also provided. Eleven days after the initiation of vinorelbine chemotherapy and 30 days before the current admission, the patient was admitted to this hospital with fever temperature, 38.3C, neutropenia absolute neutrophil count, 770 per microliter; reference range, 1800 to 7700, and pneumonia in the left lower lobe. Dr. Reece J. Goiffon: CT of the chest and abdomen Fig. 2A, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed known metastatic involvement of the lungs, bladder, retroperitoneum, peritoneum, skeletal muscles, and subcutaneous fat.  There was no metastatic involvement of the adrenal glands, pancreas, or liver.  Dr. Cote: Empirical treatment with cefepime was administered.  Over the next several days, the neutropenia and fever resolved and the pneumonia abated.  On the seventh hospital day, the patient was discharged home with a follow-up visit scheduled in the oncology clinic.  Eleven days after hospital discharge and 12 days before the current admission, the patient attended a scheduled outpatient visit for an infusion.  He reported weakness and appeared confused.  A fingerstick glucose level was 47 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter).  Supplemental oral and intravenous glucose was administered, and his mental status improved, but fingerstick glucose levels remained below 70 mg per deciliter (3.9 mmol per liter).  Review of fingerstick glucose measurements obtained during the patient’s recent hospitalization showed multiple levels ranging from 50 to 60 mg per deciliter (2.8 to 3.3 mmol per liter).  The patient was admitted to the oncology unit of this hospital for the management of hypoglycemia.  Laboratory test results from the second hospital admission are shown in Table 1.  While the patient was in the hospital, he began to have diaphoresis that correlated with episodes of hypoglycemia, for which he received orange juice and dextrose.  On evaluation by a dietitian, he was found to be meeting anticipated caloric requirements.  The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day;  the blood glucose level was 55 mg per deciliter (3.1 mmol per liter) before discharge.  Three days later and 6 days before the current admission, the patient attended the scheduled follow-up visit in the oncology clinic.  Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.  Treatment with trabectedin was initiated, along with pegfilgrastim and a 3-day tapering course of dexamethasone.  The day after the dexamethasone course was completed, the patient reported increased fatigue and cough.  Two days later, he was admitted to the oncology unit because of weakness and diaphoresis;  a fingerstick glucose level was 49 mg per deciliter (2.7 mmol per liter).  On the current admission, review of systems was notable for fatigue;  pain associated with tumors involving the back, shoulders, and right leg;  numbness of the right leg;  the use of an indwelling Foley catheter for 2 months owing to urinary retention;  dull chest pain and intermittent dyspnea that had persisted for 4 months;  and constipation.  The patient had no recent anorexia, weight change, fever, chills, orthopnea, hemoptysis, light-headedness, dizziness, palpitations, syncope, nausea, or vomiting.  The patient’s medical history was notable for transfusion-dependent anemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus (for which he had received metformin, although not in the previous 6 months), hypertension, a colonic tubular adenoma, a renal cyst, osteoarthritis, chronic low-back pain, and depression.  He had undergone an appendectomy in the remote past.  Medications included oral gabapentin, cyanocobalamin, tamsulosin, and finasteride;  transdermal fentanyl;  and oral acetaminophen, clonazepam, melatonin, polyethylene glycol, and oxycodone as needed.  He had no access to insulin or other hypoglycemic medications.  There were no known adverse drug reactions.  The patient had formerly worked as a laborer and had been receiving disability benefits since the motor vehicle accident.  He had previously consumed six beers per week and smoked one pack of cigarettes per day, but he had stopped drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco 1 year earlier.  There was no history of other substance use.  His family history of cancer included melanoma in his father, thyroid cancer in his sister, ovarian cancer in his maternal grandmother, leukemia in his maternal aunt, and sarcoma in his paternal uncle.  His mother had hypertension and dyslipidemia, and a brother had diabetes.  The patient had an adult child, who was healthy.  The tympanic temperature was 37.0°C, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 148//87 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air.  Multiple tender, palpable masses were present, including masses on the left shoulder, neck, and left upper leg.  A venous-access port was in place in the chest wall on the right side.  The abdominal incision was well healed.  A Foley catheter was in place, and there was pink-tinged urine.  A faint rash was present on the lower abdomen at the site of previous radiation therapy.  Edema was present in both legs.  Laboratory test results from the current hospital admission are shown in Table 1.  Dr. Goiffon: A chest radiograph (Figure 2B) showed abundant metastatic pulmonary nodules.  CT of the chest (Figure 2C and 2D), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed that the nodules had increased in size and quantity over a period of 1 month. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Dr. Cote: An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, a leftward axis, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes, and intraventricular conduction delay. On the first hospital day, although the patient was receiving a continuous infusion of dextrose, five bolus injections of dextrose and six glasses of orange juice were needed to increase the blood glucose level to more than 100 mg per deciliter (5.6 mmol per liter). On the morning of the second hospital day, the blood glucose level was 42 mg per deciliter (2.3 mmol per liter). Treatment with oral prednisone was initiated.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Doege–Potter syndrome. ", "prediction": "1. Paraneoplastic syndrome: Hypoglycemia could be caused by the metastatic solitary fibrous tumor producing insulin-like growth factors or other substances that affect glucose metabolism.\n2. Adrenal insufficiency: Given the patient's chronic corticosteroid use and subsequent cessation, adrenal insufficiency could lead to hypoglycemia due to insufficient cortisol production.\n3. Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Although the patient hasn't been on metformin recently, fluctuating glucose levels are a common feature in diabetes mellitus, and it's possible his glucose regulation has worsened.\n4. Chemotherapy-induced hypoglycemia: Recent chemotherapy regimens, including vinorelbine and doxorubicin, can affect liver function and glucose metabolism, potentially leading to hypoglycemia.\n5. Infection-induced hypoglycemia: Previous pneumonia and neutropenia episodes could have residual systemic effects or a new underlying infection causing hypoglycemia.\n6. Sepsis: The patient’s recurrent infections and current symptoms (fatigue, diaphoresis) may indicate an ongoing or new systemic infection causing hypoglycemia.\n7. Malnutrition: Despite meeting caloric requirements, cancer-induced cachexia and tumor metabolic demands could contribute to hypoglycemia.\n8. Liver dysfunction: Although liver involvement was not noted, occult liver dysfunction due to metastases or chemotherapy could impair gluconeogenesis, leading to hypoglycemia.\n9. Insulinoma: A less likely but possible cause of recurrent hypoglycemia is an insulin-secreting tumor, which should be considered despite the atypical presentation.\n10. Factitious hypoglycemia: Although there was no known insulin or hypoglycemic medication use, it remains a consideration to rule out deliberate or accidental administration of such agents."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Jonathan E. Lu Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear: A 61-year-old man was evaluated in an ophthalmology clinic affiliated with this hospital because of eyelid swelling. Eight years before the current presentation, the patient noticed mild puffiness of the eyelids that was worst in the morning and typically resolved by midday. Five years before the current presentation, the eyelid swelling began to progressively worsen and to last throughout the day. The patient had a history of glaucoma; when the eyelid swelling began to interfere with his vision, he asked for a consultation with the ophthalmologist who had treated his glaucoma. A diagnosis of dermatochalasis with fat prolapse was suspected, and the patient was referred to the ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery clinic affiliated with this hospital for consideration of blepharoplasty. In the clinic, the patient reported that eyelid puffiness was interfering with his ability to read and drive. He did not have dry eye. He had a sensation of pressure behind the eyes and intermittent double vision. There was generalized joint stiffness in the mornings that resolved after 1 hour. There was left lateral hip pain that radiated to the left buttock and thigh, with associated paresthesia in the left foot. Human immunodeficiency virus HIV infection had been diagnosed 31 years before the current presentation and was well controlled with antiretroviral therapy, although lipodystrophy had occurred with treatment. Other medical history included carpal tunnel syndrome, cataracts, depression, dyslipidemia, hypertension, allergic rhinitis, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma, in addition to primary open-angle glaucoma. Surgical history included carpal tunnel release surgery performed 2 months before the current presentation, intraocular lens replacement in both eyes, and lipectomy for the reduction of dorsocervical lipohypertrophy due to lipodystrophy. Medications included antiretroviral therapy elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, bupropion, fluoxetine, triamterene, amlodipine, atorvastatin, inhaled albuterol, and topical testosterone. The administration of iodinated contrast material had caused hives. The patient lived part time in Florida and part time in New England. He was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit substances. On examination, the corrected visual acuity was 2025 in the right eye and 2030 in the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light. Confrontation testing revealed deficits in the outer superior temporal visual fields and the superior nasal visual fields, which abated with manual elevation of the eyelids. Supraduction and abduction were limited in both eyes. Soft edema of the upper and lower eyelids was present, along with mild erythema of the upper eyelids Fig. 1. The upper-eyelid skin was overhanging the lashes medially, a finding indicative of dermatochalasis. There was upper-eyelid ptosis. The globes were moderately resistant to retro-pulsion, and there was mild proptosis. The leva-tor palpebrae superioris muscles had impaired function, with an eyelid elevation of 8 mm in the right eye and 11 mm in the left eye reference range, 12 to 18. Slit-lamp examination revealed 1 chemosis and trace injection in the conjunc-tivae; there was no evidence of superficial punc-tate keratopathy or cells in the anterior chambers. Funduscopic examination revealed an increased cup-to-disk ratio in the optic nerves, a finding consistent with the patients known history of glaucoma. The tongue was enlarged, and there was dorsocervical lipohypertrophy on the posterior aspect of the neck. The blood levels of thyrotropin, free thyroxine, triiodothyronine, thyroid peroxidase antibodies, and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins were normal. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Laura V. Romo: Computed tomography CT of the face and orbits Fig. 2A and 2B, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilateral enlargement of the extraocular muscles and fat stranding in the orbits and elsewhere in the face. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the face and orbits Fig. 2C through 2F, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed orbital fat strand-ing and mild, symmetric, diffuse extraocular-muscle enlargement. A short-tau inversion recovery sequence showed an increased signal that spared the myotendinous junctions. Diffuse thickening and stranding of the skin on the preseptal eyelids and face, episcleritis along the posterior margin of both globes, and perineuritis around the optic nerves were also noted. Dr. Lu: The blood levels of glucose and electrolytes and the results of kidney-function tests were normal, as were the blood levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE, lysozyme, rheumatoid factor, and C-reactive protein. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 22 mm per hour reference range, 0 to 20. The blood IgG level was 1980 mg per deciliter reference range, 767 to 1590, the IgG1 level 283 mg per deciliter reference range, 341 to 894, and the IgG2 level 1750 mg per deciliter reference range, 171 to 632; the blood IgG3 and IgG4 levels were normal. Indirect immunofluorescence testing for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ANCAs was negative, including an enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay for antibodies to proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase. A rapid plasma reagin test was nonreactive. An interferon- release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex infection was negative. A diagnostic procedure was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Systemic immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) amy-loidosis. ", "prediction": "1. Orbital Myositis: The CT and MRI evidence of bilateral extraocular muscle enlargement and fat stranding suggest an inflammatory process affecting the muscles, indicative of orbital myositis.\n2. Thyroid Eye Disease (TED): Normal thyroid function tests make this less likely, but the presence of proptosis, impaired eye movements, and orbicular muscle enlargement are classic features that warrant consideration.\n3. Amyloidosis: The patient’s enlarged tongue and fat stranding on imaging raise the possibility of amyloidosis, which can cause eyelid and orbital findings.\n4. Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Disease (IOID): The diffuse inflammatory changes seen on imaging, including episcleritis and perineuritis, could be due to IOID, excluding other specific causes.\n5. IgG4-Related Disease: Elevated IgG2 and other subtype levels, along with imaging findings, could suggest IgG4-related disease, known to affect orbital structures.\n6. Sarcoidosis: Despite normal ACE levels, the granulomatous inflammatory nature of sarcoidosis should be considered given the orbital involvement and systemic symptoms.\n7. Chronic Dacryoadenitis: Chronic inflammation of the lacrimal gland secondary to either autoimmune or infectious causes could manifest with similar bilateral orbital involvement.\n8. Wegener's Granulomatosis: Though ANCA tests were negative, this vasculitic disorder could present with orbital inflammation and should be ruled out.\n9. Carcinoid Syndrome: The lipohypertrophy, proptosis, and systemic symptoms might hint at a paraneoplastic syndrome such as carcinoid, though this is less common.\n10. Lymphoma: Orbital lymphomas can present with similar orbital masses and inflammatory changes, making it a differential worth exploring particularly if systemic involvement is suspected."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Yuefan Chen Anesthesia, Critical Care, and Pain Medicine: A 59-year-old woman had hypotension and electrocardiographic ECG ST-segment abnormalities after the administration of anesthetic agents while she was in the operating room of this hospital. Eighteen weeks before the current presentation, features of acromegaly were observed on routine physical examination by the patients primary care provider at another hospital. The blood level of insulin-like growth factor I IGF-I was 595 ng per milliliter reference range, 50 to 317 and the growth hormone level 9.1 ng per milliliter reference range, 0.0 to 7.1. The patient was referred to the endocrinology clinic of this hospital. Eleven weeks before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the endocrinology clinic. She reported that her shoe size, which had been stable since young adulthood, had recently increased by two sizes. She also reported a deepening of her voice, fatigue, headaches, arthralgias, oily skin, skin tags, and acne on her face and back. She had had an intentional weight loss of 12.7 kg during the previous 9 months. The facial features were coarse, and there was no frontal bossing. Visual fields were full on confrontation testing. The tongue was thick and obscured the soft palate; the lower jaw was enlarged, with increased spacing between the teeth. The hands and feet were large and fleshy. Scattered skin tags were present on the neck. Auscultation of the heart and lungs revealed no abnormalities. Imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head revealed a normal-sized pituitary gland with a well-circumscribed area of hypoenhancement that measured 9 mm by 7 mm by 10 mm. The patient was referred to the neurosurgery clinic of this hospital, and an elective microscopic transsphenoidal hypophysectomy was subsequently recommended. Seven weeks before the current presentation, an extensive preoperative evalua-tion was performed, given the patients diagnosis of acromegaly. As part of the preoperative evaluation, additional history was obtained. The patients medical history included hypertension, prediabetes, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, polycystic ovary syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and scoliosis. Physical activity was limited by pain in the knees; she could climb a flight of stairs but did so very slowly because of knee pain. She had no chest pain or dyspnea. Medications included hydrochlorothia-zide, olmesartan, and ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed for joint pain. Hydroxychloro-quine had caused leukopenia, and meperidine had caused gastrointestinal upset. The patient lived in a rural area of New England with her husband and worked in an office. She did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; she drank alcohol rarely. Multiple maternal and paternal family members had cardiovascular disease. ECG revealed sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities, including a T-wave inversion in lead III. A transthoracic echocardiogram TTE showed normal left ventricular volume and systolic function, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55, and there were no wall-motion abnormalities. The right ventricular volume and systolic function were normal; the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure was 28 mm Hg. Mild mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation were present. A pharmacologic stress test, with myocardial perfusion imaging performed after the administration of regadenoson, revealed no evidence of ischemia. Three weeks before the current presentation, the patient was taken to the operating room for transsphenoidal hypophysectomy. The preoperative temporal temperature was 36.7C, the heart rate 72 beats per minute, the blood pressure 131/69 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97 while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 35.7. Midazolam was administered, and anesthesia was induced with fentanyl, propofol, lidocaine, and rocuronium. Tracheal intubation was moderately challenging because of the presence of redundant tissue in the supraglottic region. During intubation, the oxygen saturation decreased to 79 but normalized in less than 1 minute. Inhaled sevoflurane an anesthetic and dexameth-asone and piperacillintazobactam were administered, remifentanil and phenylephrine infusions were started, and the patient was placed in a level, supine position for the procedure. After the induction of anesthesia, before the surgical procedure was initiated, the blood pressure gradually decreased Fig. 1A. Sixteen minutes after induction began, the blood pressure was 96/48 mm Hg and the heart rate 75 beats per minute; 29 minutes after induction began, the blood pressure had decreased to 67/36 mm Hg and the heart rate to 71 beats per minute. Telemetric monitoring Fig. 2A showed ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads and ST-segment depressions and T-wave inversions in the anterior and lateral leads. Aspirin was administered rectally, the rate of the phenylephrine infusion was increased, and multiple boluses of phenyl-ephrine and an ephedrine bolus were administered. The blood pressure increased to 110/54 mm Hg and the heart rate to 111 beats per minute. Telemetric monitoring showed resolution of the ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Findings on ECG and transesophageal echocar-diography TEE performed in the operating room were consistent with those of the preoperative ECG and TTE. The procedure was aborted, the patient was weaned from the vasopressor therapies, and the trachea was extubated. She was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit. On admission to the cardiac intensive care unit, the blood level of troponin T was 10 ng per liter reference range, 0 to 9; 1 hour later, the level had decreased to 8 ng per liter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiography was normal. Computed tomographic angiography of the coronary arteries revealed moderate stenosis of the distal left anterior descending coronary artery. The intraoperative ST-segment elevations were attributed to coronary vasospasm. Treatment with amlodipine and iso-sorbide mononitrate was initiated for coronary vasospasm, and treatment with atorvastatin was started for nonobstructive coronary artery disease. After discussion among the cardiology, neurosurgery, and anesthesia teams, it was determined that the patient remained a candidate for transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, particularly because the surgery could offer a cure for her acromegaly; the procedure was rescheduled. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day. During the subsequent 3 weeks, the patient continued taking the newly prescribed medications, and no new symptoms developed. On the day of the current presentation, she was again taken to the operating room to undergo transs-phenoidal hypophysectomy. The preoperative blood pressure, as measured through an arterial catheter, was 118/67 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute. Sedation with fentanyl and mid-azolam was started, topical lidocaine was used to anesthetize the airways, and fiberoptic tracheal intubation was performed while the patient was awake. Anesthesia was then induced with propo-fol, rocuronium, and sevoflurane. A phenyleph-rine infusion was started, and piperacillintazo-bactam was administered. The blood pressure decreased abruptly to 54/29 mm Hg Fig. 1B. Telemetric monitoring Fig. 2B showed ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads and ST-segment depressions and T-wave inversions in the anterior and lateral leads. Management decisions were made, and a diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Kounis syndrome due to exposure to piperacillin– tazobactam. ", "prediction": "1. Coronary Vasospasm: The abrupt decrease in blood pressure and the characteristic ST-segment elevations suggest that coronary vasospasm may have recurred during anesthesia induction.\n2. Nonobstructive Coronary Artery Disease: The previously noted moderate stenosis of the distal left anterior descending artery could contribute to the patient's ECG changes and hypotension during stress from anesthesia.\n3. Acute Coronary Syndrome: Although less likely due to the absence of ischemia on prior imaging, the patient's cardiovascular risk factors and ECG changes warrant consideration.\n4. Anesthetic-induced Hypotension: The induction agents such as propofol and sevoflurane are known to cause significant vasodilation and hypotension.\n5. Adrenal Insufficiency: Sudden hypotension, especially under stress, could indicate adrenal insufficiency, potentially exacerbated by underlying adrenal suppression.\n6. Acromegaly-related Cardiomyopathy: Patients with acromegaly can develop a cardiomyopathy that might decompensate under the stress of anesthesia, leading to hypotension and ECG changes.\n7. Pulmonary Embolism: Although acute PE is less likely with normal O2 saturation preoperatively, intraoperative hypoxia and hypotension warrant evaluation.\n8. Hypovolemia: Perioperative fasting or inadequate fluid resuscitation could predispose the patient to hypotension under anesthesia.\n9. Electrolyte Imbalance: Conditions such as hyperkalemia or hypocalcemia should be ruled out as they can exacerbate hypotension and cause ECG changes.\n10. Medication Reaction: Interactions or adverse reactions between anesthetic agents and the patient’s chronic medications, such as antihypertensives, could contribute to the hemodynamic instability."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: CME Dr. Alison S. Witkin: A 21-year-old male college student was evaluated in the cardiology clinic at this hospital, before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, because of progressive dyspnea. When the patient was in his early teens, he was evaluated for intermittent ex-ertional dyspnea and received a diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma. Montelukast and an albuterol inhaler were prescribed for use as needed; however, he had not used these medications in the 2 years before the current presentation. Several months before the current presentation, the patient noticed increased dyspnea, which occurred when he was playing sports such as volleyball or walking on campus, specifically when walking at an incline or while carrying parcels. Friends had commented on his inability to keep up during games and while walking. Six days before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated for dyspnea by his primary care physician at a hospital affiliated with this hospital. The heart rate was 71 beats per minute and the oxygen saturation 97 while he was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was reportedly normal. An electrocardiogram ECG, transthoracic echocardiogram TTE, and chest radiograph were obtained. Dr. David M. Dudzinski: An ECG Fig. 1A showed right bundle-branch block and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. A TTE Fig. 1B and 1C showed right ventricular enlargement with severe hypokinesia and hypertrophy estimated right ventricular systolic pressure, 84 mm Hg, right atrial enlargement, flattening of the interventricular septum during systole and diastole, moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, and inferior vena cava dilatation. Dr. Anuradha S. Shenoy-Bhangle: A frontal chest radiograph Fig. 2A showed enlarged hila and an irregular calcification over the right upper quadrant. Dr. Witkin: The patient was referred to the emergency department of the other hospital. On examination, the heart rate was 77 beats per minute, the blood pressure 130//82 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was reportedly normal. The white-cell differential count and blood levels of calcium, amylase, lipase, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Echocardiography performed after the administration of agitated saline (a “bubble study”) did not reveal an atrial septal defect, but a patent foramen ovale with right-to-left shunting was identified. Dr. Shenoy-Bhangle: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 2B and 2C), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material and in accordance with a pulmonary embolism protocol, ruled out pulmonary embolism. However, the main pulmonary artery was dilated (diameter, 39 mm; normal value, 29 in men and 27 in women), as were segmental pulmonary artery branches. The right ventricle was enlarged. Bilateral mild, diffuse, centrilobular ground-glass nodules were noted, along with interlobular septal thickening. A 45-mm area of coarse calcification was seen in the right lobe of the liver. Dr. Witkin: The patient was discharged from the emergency department of the other hospital with a plan for follow-up the next morning in the cardiology clinic at this hospital. At the follow-up visit, the system review was notable for snoring (reported by his roommates) and dyspnea that occurred after he ascended three flights of stairs. He had no chest pain or pressure, edema, orthopnea, dyspnea at night, light-headedness, syncope, fever, recent illness, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, change in weight, jaundice, abdominal pain or distention, change in bowel habits, nausea, anorexia, hair or nail changes, or rash. The patient’s medical history was notable for internal hemorrhoids with an episode of rectal bleeding, as well as a traumatic ankle sprain 3 years before the current presentation. He took no medications but had previously taken methylphenidate and atomoxetine for a learning disability characterized by inattention and difficulty with auditory processing. He took several supplements for calming and increased attention, which included the following ingredients: rhodiola extract, phosphatidylserine, melatonin, astaxanthin, and amino acids such as glutamate, glycine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, taurine, theanine, and tyrosine. He consumed protein shakes before workouts and had used creatine supplements 2 years earlier. He had received an influenza vaccine and all the routine immunizations that are required to attend school. The patient was a student at a local college. During the current school year, he had been exercising at the gym three times per week, doing mostly isometric exercise and some aerobic exercise. He had never used cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, marijuana, or illicit substances. He lived with roommates, and there were no known allergic or environmental exposures in their apartment. His family history was notable for inflammatory bowel disease in his father, coronary artery disease in several paternal relatives, myocardial infarction in his maternal grandfather (when he was in his 70s), colon cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease after long-term smoking in his maternal grandmother, and asthma in his maternal aunt. His two siblings were healthy. On examination, the heart rate was 81 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120//72 mm Hg in the right arm and 122//72 mm Hg in the left arm, and the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was in the supine position and breathing ambient air, and the level decreased to 90% after he ascended two flights of stairs. The weight was 79.8 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.6. The patient appeared to have normal development and was breathing comfortably. The sclerae were anicteric. The jugular venous pressure was 14 cm of water. A parasternal heave was detected. On auscultation, the lungs were clear, the P2 heart sound was accentuated, and a grade 3/6 early systolic murmur was present at the left sternal border. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. Clubbing of the fingers and toes was present, without cyanosis. An ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 81 beats per minute, right bundle-branch block, and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. Blood levels of thyrotropin and glycated hemoglobin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Additional tests were performed the next day. Spirometry showed normal lung volumes and a reduced diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO; 71% of the predicted value). A bronchodilator test showed no clinically significant response to an inhaled bronchodilator. Right heart catheterization revealed a right atrial pressure of 6 mm Hg, a right ventricular pressure of 90//7 mm Hg, a pulmonary arterial pressure of 89//28 mm Hg (mean pulmonary arterial pressure, 57 mm Hg), and a pulmonary arterial wedge pressure of 8 mm Hg. The central venous oxygen saturation was 67% (reference range, 60 to 70), the mixed venous oxygen saturation 71% (reference range, 65 to 75), and the arterial oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The cardiac output, measured by means of thermodilution, was 6.2 liters per minute. The pulmonary vascular resistance was approximately 8 Wood units. After the patient inhaled 30 ppm of nitric oxide, the mean pulmonary arterial pressure was 52 mm Hg and the cardiac output 6.0 liters per minute. A diagnosis was made. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Congenital absence of the main portal vein with a congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt (Abernethy malformation). ", "prediction": "1.

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH): Although a CT pulmonary angiogram ruled out acute pulmonary embolism, chronic thromboembolic disease could still explain the patient's pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy.\n3. Congenital heart disease (e.g., atrial septal defect): The presence of a patent foramen ovale with right-to-left shunting suggests a congenital anomaly that could lead to pulmonary hypertension and right heart strain.\n4. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): The patient's history of snoring, observed hypoxemia on exertion, and elevated pulmonary pressures may be related to undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea.\n5. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Right ventricular hypertrophy and exertional dyspnea could be explained by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, particularly given the presence of a significant cardiac murmur.\n6. Interstitial lung disease: The CT findings of ground-glass nodules and interlobular septal thickening might suggest an underlying interstitial lung disease contributing to the patient's pulmonary symptoms and reduced DLCO.\n7. Sarcoidosis: This inflammatory condition can cause pulmonary involvement and has been associated with right heart failure symptoms, enlarged hila on chest radiograph, and liver calcifications.\n8. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: This condition typically presents with progressive dyspnea and findings on imaging consistent with fibrosis, potentially leading to secondary pulmonary hypertension.\n9. Connective tissue disease-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension: Diseases such as systemic sclerosis can lead to pulmonary arterial hypertension and present with similar cardiac and pulmonary findings.\n10.

Peyton Medicine: A 43-year-old man was evaluated in the multidisciplinary Pulmonary Nodule Clinic of this hospital because of an incidentally found pulmonary nodule. One month before the current evaluation, the patient, who lived in Panama, was seen at a primary care clinic in Colombia for a routine annual physical examination. He was in his usual state of good health, but because of a family history of cancer, he requested that imaging studies be obtained. Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: Computed tomography CT of the neck, chest, and abdomen Fig. 1, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a pulmonary nodule measuring 12 mm by 13 mm in the right middle lobe. Dr. Peyton: During the next month, follow-up testing was performed. The 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid level in a 24-hour urine specimen and the chromogranin A level in blood were reportedly normal, as were the results of pulmonary function testing and colonoscopy. Dr. Shepard: 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose FDGpositron-emission tomography PET and CT Fig. 2 revealed FDG uptake in the right-middle-lobe nodule measuring 14 mm in diameter, with a maximum standardized uptake value of 3.8. There was also FDG uptake in multiple normal-sized right inferior paratracheal, subcarinal, and hilar lymph nodes. A right hilar lymph node measuring 8 mm in diameter had a maximum standardized uptake value of 6.7. Dr. Peyton: The patient requested evaluation in the United States and was referred to the multidisciplinary Pulmonary Nodule Clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient felt well. He had no fever, shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, headache, vision changes, oral ulcers, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, arthralgias, or rash. He reported no recent illnesses. The patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Three years before this evaluation, chest radiography and abdominal ultrasonography, performed at his request because of a family history of cancer, had reportedly shown no abnormalities. The patient took no medications and had no known drug allergies. He worked in the finance industry and had previously been a health care worker. He was born in northern South America and had moved to southern Central America 5 years earlier. He lived in an urban area with his wife, son, and dog. The patient had visited nearly every country in North America, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. Four years earlier, he had traveled by motorcycle from Alaska to Panama; 6 months earlier, he had traveled by motorcycle from Colombia to Chile. The patient had also traveled to several countries in western and eastern Europe, northern Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Pacific Islands. He had a physically active lifestyle that included weight lifting and bicycling at least four times per week. He had smoked two cigarettes daily and one cigar every 3 months for 2 years. His family history of cancer included breast cancer in his mother, prostate and pancreatic cancers in his father, cancer of unknown primary origin in his maternal grandfather, and ovarian cancer in his paternal grandmother. On evaluation, the temporal temperature was 36.2C, the blood pressure 133/82 mm Hg, the pulse 68 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 27.1. He appeared well, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. There was no palpable cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The white-cell count was 6970 per microliter reference range, 4500 to 11,000, the hemoglobin level 12.7 g per deciliter reference range, 13.5 to 17.5, and the platelet count 213,000 per microliter reference range, 150,000 to 400,000.

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: Dr. Daniele Lerner Pediatrics: An 18-year-old man with the Dravet syndrome was admitted to this hospital because of fever and increased frequency of seizures. The Dravet syndrome, which is caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes the sodium channel 1 subunit SCN1A, had been diagnosed during evaluation for intractable seizures that had begun when the patient was 6 months of age. He had had developmental delay, was nonverbal, and required supervision while walking because of a slow, shuffling gait with associated falls. The patient was in his usual state of health until 2 months before this admission, when his parents noticed swelling of the left foot after a fall. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital, and radiography of the left foot was reportedly normal. Two weeks before this admission, swelling of the left foot increased. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician, and additional imaging of the foot was recommended. The patient was already scheduled for magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head which was planned to be performed with the patient under general anesthesia as part of a research study for patients with the Dravet syndrome.1 MRI of the left foot was performed at the same time. Dr. Teresa Victoria: MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse cerebral volume loss. There were incidental secretions filling the sphenoid and frontal sinuses that had heterogeneous signal intensity on T2-weighted images and hyperintense signal intensity on T1-weighted images; mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses was also noted. MRI of the left foot, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal bone marrow edema in the midfoot and hindfoot. There was no fracture, dislocation, or joint effusion. Dr. Lerner: Treatment with amoxicillin was initiated by the patients primary care physician to treat possible sinusitis. Seven days before this admission, the patients parents noticed increased swelling and new warmth of the left foot, and the patient appeared uncomfortable when bearing weight on that foot. The oral tempera-CME ture measured at home was 38.3C. Five days before this admission, bruising of the left foot developed, and the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient was afebrile and appeared well. There was swelling, bruising, and tenderness of the left foot. The white-cell count was 5870 per microliter reference range, 4500 to 13,000, the hemoglobin level 11.6 g per deciliter reference range, 13.5 to 17.5, and the blood level of C-reactive protein CRP 23.9 mg per liter reference range, 0.0 to 8.0; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Victoria: Radiography of the left foot Fig. 1 revealed minimally displaced fractures at the base of the second metatarsal and the cuboid, as well as diffuse bone demineralization. Dr. Lerner: A walking cast was placed, and the patient was discharged home. During the next 5 days, his parents noticed that he was less interactive than usual. He had intermittent dia-phoresis and tachycardia, and the frequency of seizures had increased from one every 2 to 3 days to two or three seizures daily. One day before this admission, the oral temperature measured at home was 38.1C. After a telephone consultation with the patients primary care physician, treatment with amoxicillin was changed to amox-icillinclavulanate. The seizure frequency did not decrease, and the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. Additional history was obtained from the patients parents. They had not observed nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, or cough. The patient had gingivitis that had recently worsened; during the 2 weeks before this admission, there had been new bleeding from the gums and bleeding from the nose. The patient was following a ke-togenic diet as adjunctive treatment for seizures; because of multiple food allergies, the ketogenic formula was administered through a gastrosto-my tube. He had loose stools, which the parents attributed to tube feeding; the stools were unchanged in volume and frequency. He had had two episodes of nonbilious, nonbloody emesis during the week before this admission. The patients parents also reported that 7 months before this admission, the patient had begun to have fever, vomiting, and increased volume and frequency of stools; coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19 was diagnosed, and the volume of the ketogenic formula was decreased by half for 4 days until vomiting resolved. Medications included amoxicillinclavulanate, canna-bidiol, clobazam, famotidine, glycopyrrolate, levocarnitine, levocetirizine, a multivitamin, potassium citrate, and phosphorus, as well as loraz-epam as needed for seizures lasting longer than several minutes. He had no known drug allergies. He lived with his father and two cats in an urban area of New England; he occasionally stayed with his mother in a rural area of New England. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.8C, the heart rate 124 beats per minute, the blood pressure 124/87 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 20.8. The patient appeared tired and flushed but was alert and interactive. There was low muscular bulk and tone. The gingivae were erythematous and bleeding Fig. 2, and several dental caries were seen. There was no sinus tenderness or discharge. The lungs were clear on auscultation, and the heart sounds were normal. The abdomen was nontender, and the insertion site of the gastrostomy tube was not erythema-tous or indurated. The walking cast was removed; there was edema and bruising of the left foot Fig. 2. The results of tests of liver function and kidney function were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes and glucose. Urinalysis was normal; there were 2 ketones reference value, negative; however, 2 is considered to be a normal value for patients following a therapeutic ketogenic diet. The blood level of CRP had increased to 74.0 mg per liter; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1 through 4, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus and enterovirus, Bordetella pertussis, B. parapertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae was negative. Stool testing for Clostridium difficile antigen and toxin was negative, as was a stool examination for ova and parasites. Specimens of blood and stool were sent for culture. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Victoria: Radiography of the chest revealed a patchy opacity in the right lung base. Radiography of the left foot (Figure 1) revealed diffuse bone demineralization and fractures of the second metatarsal and cuboid, findings that were similar to those seen on previous imaging. There was sclerosis in the proximal first and distal fourth and fifth metatarsals that was suggestive of new fractures. A crescentic osseous fragment was thought to be an avulsed fragment of bone. Dr. Lerner: A diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was made, treatment with intravenous fluids and ampicillin–sulbactam was administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. During the next 7 days, he had no fever, but tachycardia persisted. Blood cultures showed no growth, and stool cultures showed normal intestinal flora. The CRP level had increased to 108.1 mg per liter, the d-dimer level was 6953 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 500), and the hemoglobin level had decreased to 7.0 g per deciliter. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Victoria: Radiography of the left foot (Figure 1) revealed multiple new areas of cortical erosions, including the medial base of the first metatarsal and the medial navicular bone. MRI of the left tibia, fibula, and foot (Figure 3), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed worsening bone edema in the left foot; foci of bone edema were also seen in the proximal tibia and fibula. Multiple fractures that had been seen on previous imaging of the left foot were noted, and there were intraosseous cystic hemorrhagic foci within the calcaneal, cuboid, and second metatarsal fractures. Dr. Lerner: On hospital day 8, the temporal temperature was 38.0°C. New nontender, purpuric macules were present on the fingers, hands (Figure 2), arms, and toes. A diagnostic test was performed. Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Multiple vitamin deficiencies, including vitamin C deficiency. ", "prediction": "1. Osteomyelitis: The presence of bone marrow edema, fractures with no signs of healing, persistently elevated CRP levels, and worsening bone condition on MRI suggest a bone infection.\n2. Vitamin D Deficiency/Rickets: The diffuse bone demineralization and multiple fractures indicate potential deficiency in vitamin D or other nutrients affecting bone health, especially in a patient on a restricted diet.\n3. Acute Leukemia: The extensive bruising, gingival bleeding, low hemoglobin, and new petechial rashes raise suspicion for an underlying hematologic malignancy.\n4. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever, tachycardia, increasing CRP levels, and systemic signs such as purpuric macules could indicate a systemic infection despite negative blood cultures.\n5. Scurvy (Vitamin C Deficiency): Gingival bleeding, bruising, and poor wound healing are indicative of a possible vitamin C deficiency, particularly with a restricted ketogenic diet.\n6. Erythromelalgia: The patient's warm, swollen, and painful foot, as well as the flushing noted during the fever episodes, suggest this rare vascular condition.\n7. Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS): The persistent and increasing pain, edema, bruising, and autonomic symptoms like tachycardia align with CRPS criteria.\n8. Coagulopathy: The easy bruising, gingival bleeding, and unexplained hemoglobin drop might suggest an underlying clotting disorder, necessitating a thorough evaluation of coagulation factors.\n9. Inherited Bone Fragility Disorder: Conditions such as osteogenesis imperfecta should be considered given the multifocal fractures and bone demineralization.\n10. Autoimmune Vasculitis: The presence of new purpuric macules on the fingers and toes, systemic symptoms, and elevated inflammatory markers raise the possibility of a vasculitic process."}

Mitochondrial disease: Considering the patient's history of celiac disease, fatigue, and somatic symptoms, a mitochondrial disorder could be a possibility, especially with the presence of a prolonged QT interval.\n\nINPUT: CME Dr. Margaret R. Connolly Surgery: A 15-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain and an ovarian mass. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 6 weeks before the current presentation, when lower abdominal pain developed along the midline. The pain was sharp and crampy, increased with movement, and decreased with lying down. During the next 24 hours, the pain shifted from the midline to the right side. The patient was taken to the emergency department of a hospital affiliated with this hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7C, the blood pressure 125/82 mm Hg, the pulse 102 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98 while the patient was breathing ambient air. The lower abdomen had mild tenderness that was present on both sides but was greater on the right side. The abdomen was soft and nondistended. Bowel sounds were normal, and there was no rebound, guarding, or tenderness at the costover-tebral angle. The white-cell count was 14,270 per microliter reference range, 4500 to 13,500 and the hemoglobin level 10.9 g per deciliter reference range, 12.0 to 16.0. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The urinalysis was normal. A urine test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were performed. Dr. Ali Pourvaziri: Transabdominal ultrasonography with Doppler analysis revealed a complex, thick-walled cyst in the right ovary. There were multiple follicular cysts, measuring up to 1.7 cm in diameter, in the left ovary. Doppler flow was normal in both ovaries. There was a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. The appendix was not visualized. Dr. Connolly: Acetaminophen, ketorolac, and intravenous fluids were administered. A diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cyst was considered, and the patient was discharged home with plans to undergo repeat transabdominal ultrasonography 6 weeks later. After the patient was discharged from the emergency department, the abdominal pain slowly resolved. Three days after discharge, the patient resumed competitive long-distance running. Five weeks later, and 4 days before the current presentation, she participated in a running competition. The next day, abdominal pain recurred, and the patient was unable to go to school. She took ibuprofen, but it did not alleviate the pain. She was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The patient reported that the current episode of abdominal pain was similar to the episode that had occurred 6 weeks earlier. She had no fever, chills, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dysuria, hematuria, frequent urination, or vaginal bleeding or discharge. She had noticed an increase in her waist size during the past 2 weeks and had difficulty fitting into her pants. The patient had no notable medical history. She took no medications and had no known allergies. She had normal growth and development; menarche had not occurred. She had received all routine childhood vaccinations. The patient lived in suburban New England with her parents and sister. She was not sexually active and did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her parents and sister were healthy; menarche had occurred in her mother and sister when they were each 12 years of age. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7C, the blood pressure 141/89 mm Hg, and the pulse 95 beats per minute. The body-mass index the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters was 18.7. The right lower abdomen was firm and distended, with mild tenderness. Bowel sounds were normal, and there was no rebound, guarding, or evidence of a discrete mass or hepatosplenomegaly on palpation. Development of pubic hair and breasts was classified as Tanner stage 4 with stages ranging from 1 to 5 and higher stages indicating more advanced pubertal development. The white-cell count was 16,120 per microliter and the hemoglobin level 10.1 g per deciliter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were performed. Dr. Pourvaziri: Transabdominal ultrasonography with Doppler analysis revealed a heterogeneous mass, measuring 16.6 cm by 15.6 cm by 9.9 cm, that was inseparable from the right ovary with the use of probe pressure maneuvers. The mass had normal vascular flow and areas of increased echogenicity. The left ovary was normal, and there was a moderate-to-large amount of free fluid in the pelvis. Computed tomography CT of the abdomen and pelvis Fig. 1, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed a heterogeneously attenuating mass, measuring 17.8 cm by 13.6 cm by 8.6 cm, that displaced the bowel and pelvic viscera. The mass had prominent amorphous, peripherally enhancing components and internal vasculature. The right ovary was not definitively identified separately. There was a large amount of ascitic fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the pelvis Fig. 1, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, also showed a heterogeneous mass with thick, nodular, peripheral enhancement that appeared to originate from the right adnexa. The endometrial lining appeared thickened, measuring up to 22 mm in thickness. Dr. Connolly: The patient was admitted to the hospital. A diagnostic test was performed.  Let's think step by step.\nOUTPUT:\n    ", "answer": "Juvenile granulosa-cell tumor. ", "prediction": "1. Ovarian neoplasm: The presence of a large, heterogeneous mass with vascular flow and peripheral enhancement originating from the right adnexa is highly suggestive of an ovarian tumor.\n2. Ovarian torsion: Given the right lower abdominal pain and the finding of an ovarian mass on imaging, ovarian torsion is a critical diagnosis to consider.\n3. Ruptured ovarian cyst: The initial presentation of sharp, crampy pain relieved by lying down and the presence of a complex ovarian cyst on ultrasound suggests a potential cyst rupture.\n4. Endometriosis: The patient's pelvic pain and significant endometrial thickening seen on MRI could indicate endometriosis, which often presents with similar symptoms.\n5. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): Although less likely given the patient's history and lack of sexual activity, PID can present with abdominal pain and adnexal masses.\n6. Appendicitis: The initial shift of abdominal pain to the right side and elevated white-cell count could suggest appendicitis, despite the appendix not being visualized on imaging.\n7. Functional ovarian cyst: The multiple follicular cysts observed in the left ovary and the complex cyst in the right ovary could be functional cysts contributing to the patient's symptoms.\n8. Tubo-ovarian abscess: The symptoms and imaging findings could represent a tubo-ovarian abscess, despite the patient’s lack of signs of infection.\n9. Adnexal torsion: Similar to ovarian torsion, adnexal torsion should be considered given the imaging findings and symptomatology.\n10. Germ cell tumor: The age of the patient and the complex nature of the mass raise the possibility of a germ cell tumor, which is common in this age group and can present with similar findings."}
