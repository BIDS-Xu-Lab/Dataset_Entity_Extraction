Theories that postulate cognitive inhibition are very common in psychology and cognitive neuroscience [e.g., Hasher, L., Lustig, C., & Zacks, R. T. (2007).
Inhibitory mechanisms and the control of attention.

This paper poses and attempts to answer the question whether a research program with cognitive inhibition as its main theoretical assumption is still worth pursuing.
We present a set of empirical data from a modified Stroop paradigm that replicates previously reported findings.
These findings refer to between-trial effects previously described in the literature on Stroop, negative priming, and inhibition-of-return.
Existing theoretical accounts fail to explain all these effects in an integrated way.
A repetition-suppression mechanism is proposed in order to account for these data.
This mechanism is instantiated as a computational cognitive model.
The theoretical implications of this model are discussed.
