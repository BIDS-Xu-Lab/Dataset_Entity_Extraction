The purpose of this study was to provide an overview of welfare reform and its impact on the substance-abusing recipient.
The data for this paper were derived from sources including the US Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
The number of individuals on public assistance has decreased in the years following implementation of welfare reform legislation.
Factors relevant to transitioning welfare recipients into the workplace, such as transportation and childcare, have special ramifications for the drug-using population.
Additionally, these individuals require treatment for their addictions in order to become employable.
The issue of concern is that recipients may be deterred from seeking benefits by various provisions of welfare reform legislation and turn instead to other sources (including illicit activities) for sustenance.
Welfare caseloads have been dropping over the past two years.
However, the number of substance abusers continues to rise.
It is not known in what ways welfare reform will affect substance abusers who are welfare recipients.
Important policy issues arise from this nexus; it is argued that these issues will require careful investigation.
