Physician assistants (PAs) are often members of dermatologic care teams.
Adequate knowledge of dermatologic conditions in skin of color (SOC) is crucial to proper diagnosis, treatment, and patient satisfaction.
The objective of this study was to increase PA students' objective knowledge of and comfort level with evaluating dermatologic conditions in SOC.
Eligible participants included 36 PA students at a major metropolitan medical center during the 2022 to 2023 academic year.
A preintervention survey, immediate postintervention survey, and 7-month follow-up postintervention survey were administered before and after a SOC lecture.
The surveys concluded with a 10-question, image-based, multiple-choice examination.
There was a significant increase in accurate diagnoses of acne scarring, eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, and seborrheic dermatitis in SOC (59.4% preintervention to 76.9% postintervention, P = .029).
Student confidence, as rated on a scale of 1 (minimally confident) to 5 (extremely confident), in diagnosing these conditions increased from 2.97 to 3.52 (P = .036).
Implementation of a SOC-specific dermatology lecture significantly increased the accuracy and confidence with which PA students diagnosed dermatologic conditions.
