Great variability exists in the degree of adjustment to infertility, which in turn is known to influence wellbeing.
The main objective of this study is to identify intrapersonal [neuroticism, adult attachment style (AAS), perceived internal control, meaning of parenthood and intrinsic religiosity] and interpersonal (social support and marital adjustment) associates of adjustment to infertility.
A cross-sectional analysis of 85 consecutive heterosexual women, attending three infertility clinics in northern India during July 2005-March 2006, participated in the study.
A range of scales were used to measure the intrapersonal and interpersonal attributes.
The degree of adjustment to infertility was assessed using the Fertility Adjustment Scale.
The data were analysed using multiple regression.
The intrapersonal model (49.3%) explained a larger proportion of variance than did the interpersonal model (28.4%).
Perception of children as necessary for marital completion, and the avoidance type of AAS was associated with poorer adjustment and constituted intrapersonal vulnerabilities.
In contrast, intrinsic religiosity, sexual satisfaction and familial support were associated with better adjustment and were identified as helpful intrapersonal and interpersonal coping resources.
The findings of the study highlight the merit of understanding intra- and interpersonal attributes for achieving better wellbeing outcomes.
These findings would also prove valuable for researchers and practioners involved in designing and implementing psychosocial interventions.
