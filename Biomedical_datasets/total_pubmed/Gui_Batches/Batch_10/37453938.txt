Wavelength interrogation surface plasmon resonance imaging (WSPRi) sensing has unique advantages in high-throughput imaging detection.
The refractive index resolution (RIR) of WSPRi is limited to the order of 10-6 RIU.
This paper demonstrates a novel WSPRi sensing system with a wavelength scanning device of an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) and a low-cost speckle-free SPR excitation source of a halogen lamp.
We developed a sensitive quasi-phase extraction method for data processing.
The new technique achieved an RIR of 8.84Ã—10-7 RIU, which is the first WSPRi system that has an RIR in the order of 10-7 RIU.
Moreover, we performed a real-time recording of the formation of the coffee ring effect during brine evaporation and enhanced the biosensor performance of SPR for the first time.
We believe the higher RIR and accuracy of the system will benefit more potential applications toward exploring the biomolecules' behaviors in biological and biochemistry studies.
