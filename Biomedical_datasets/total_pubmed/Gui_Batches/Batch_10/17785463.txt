In addition to their interactions with hetero-trimeric G proteins, seven-transmembrane domain receptors are now known to form multimeric complexes that can include receptor homo- or hetero-oligomers and/or accessory proteins that modulate their activity.
The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor requires the assembly of the seven-transmembrane domain calcitonin receptor-like receptor with the single-transmembrane domain receptor activity-modifying protein-1 to reach the cell surface and be active.
However, the relative stoichiometric arrangement of these two proteins within a receptor complex remains unknown.
Despite recent advances in the development of protein-protein interactions assays, determining the composition and stoichiometric arrangements of such signaling complexes in living cells remains a challenging task.
In the present study, we combined bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) with bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to probe the stoichiometric arrangement of the CGRP receptor complex.
Together with BRET competition assays, co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and BiFC imaging, dual BRET/BiFC revealed that functional CGRP receptors result from the association of a homo-oligomer of the calcitonin receptor-like receptor with a monomer of the accessory protein receptor activity-modifying protein-1.
In addition to revealing the existence of an unexpected asymmetric oligomeric organization for a G protein-coupled receptor, our study illustrates the usefulness of dual BRET/BiFC as a powerful tool for analyzing constitutive and dynamically regulated multiprotein complexes.
