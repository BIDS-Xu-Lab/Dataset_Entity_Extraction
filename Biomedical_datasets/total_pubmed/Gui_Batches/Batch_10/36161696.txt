TBX6 encodes transcription-factor box 6, a transcription factor critical to paraxial mesoderm segmentation and somitogenesis during embryonic development.
TBX6 haploinsufficiency is believed to drive the skeletal and kidney phenotypes associated with the 16p11.2 deletion syndrome.
Heterozygous and biallelic variants in TBX6 are associated with vertebral and rib malformations (TBX6-associated congenital scoliosis) and spondylocostal dysostosis, and heterozygous TBX6 variants are associated with increased risk of genitourinary tract malformations.
Combined skeletal and kidney phenotypes in individuals harboring heterozygous or biallelic TBX6 variants are rare.
Here, we present seven individuals with vertebral and rib malformations and structural kidney differences associated with heterozygous TBX6 gene deletion in trans with a hypomorphic TBX6 allele or biallelic TBX6 variants.
Our case series highlights the association between TBX6 and both skeletal and kidney disease.
