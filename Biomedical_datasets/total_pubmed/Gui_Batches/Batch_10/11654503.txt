We cannot ignore the multitude of differences in Christian doctrines.
There are more and more divisions and autogenetic beginnings.
In talking about religion, we cannot ignore these differences, especially when we are trying to help the seeker.
Neither can we ignore these differences when we talk about medical ethics.
Care demands that we address both religious and medical issues.
We must not, however, attempt to formulate a new religious bioethics in the context of any failure to address the differences and similarities as the record of Christian history reveals.
History can reveal to us many things we may not know about ourselves as Christian.
Understanding our Christian heritage is essential in order to understand our approach to any Christian bioethic.
This essay will look at Christian history to articulate the differences in Orthodox and non-Orthodox formation.
Primary focus will be on the Great Schism and the value of natural law theology in the development of Christian bioethics.
Reference will be made to end-of-life decision making to clarify the issues.
