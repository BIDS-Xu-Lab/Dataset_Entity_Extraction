Apoptosis is necessary for the balance between cell proliferation and loss.
Thirty-six Wistar-Albino rats were subjected to investigate apoptotic effect of widely used implantable progestins on ovarian and uterine tissues.
Rats were divided into 6 groups.
In the first five groups, we applied etonogestrel (IMP) subcutaneous implants (n = 30).
The rats in groups were sacrificed sequentially every 10 days after application.
The rats in the last group (n = 6) were accepted as controls.
Apoptotic index (AI) values and Caspase-3 immunoreactivities of ovaries and uterus were recorded.
In IMP groups, AI and Hscore values in stroma and glandular epithelium of uterus, granulosa and teca-lutein cells of the ovary increased with the longer progesterone exposure.
Increase in AI and Hscore values were more prominent after 30 days of exposure for teca-lutein cells of ovary.
Progestins increased apoptosis in ovaries and uterus by the longer exposure.
Apoptosis increased in ovaries by chronic progesterone exposure.
The apoptotic effect of progestin on endometrium is clear but long-term systemic application may lead to alterations in ovarian physiology.
We evaluated time dependent apoptotic effect of etonogestrel on reproductive physiology and discussed progestins effect from another point of view in this study.
