The authors have gained the experience of diagnosis and treatment of renal cysts in 182 patients.
The disease was asymptomatic in 12 patients.
The final diagnosis was established after ultrasound scanning in 98.35% of cases.
At 3-92 month follow-up the recurrences arose in 26 (15.75%) from 165 patients subjected to transcutaneous puncture with administration of 96% alcohol for 10-15 min without draining.
Another puncture was carried out in 9 (5.56%) patients.
The recurrences were seen in all the 11 patients in whom aspiration was not followed by alcohol administration.
The authors advocate transcutaneous puncture sclerotherapy with the use of 96% alcohol for treatment of symptomatic and large cysts of the kidneys.
