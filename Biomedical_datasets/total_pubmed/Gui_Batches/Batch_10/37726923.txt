To capture current opportunities for social participation for older people living in residential aged care in Victoria, Australia.
A postal survey of all 766 Victorian residential aged care facilities.
Respondents were asked to outline the nature of social participation opportunities available to residents, any potential barriers to inclusion and organisational commitments such as funding allocations and staff fractions.
Surveys were returned by 153 facilities, representing a response rate of 20%.
All facilities had a dedicated social program, although just over half (57%; 87 of 153) offered the social program over the weekend, usually on a Saturday morning only (90%).
Barriers to older people's opportunities for social participation included their ineligibility to continue attending external community programs once entering residential aged care (86%), their illness (71%), carer availability (50%) and lack of funding (42%).
Funding for almost all programs (128 of 153; 84%) was described as internal and ad hoc, and staff allocations for the program were almost entirely fractional.
Only 12 (8%) facilities reported that they had a dedicated full-time coordinator for the social participation program.
Social participation programs are available in Victorian residential aged care facilities.
However, limited funding and staff allocations reduce the opportunities for older people to engage in meaningful social participation with others.
