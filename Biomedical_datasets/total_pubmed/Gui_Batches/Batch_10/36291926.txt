The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is an ancient homeostasis mechanism operating from embryonic stages to adulthood.
It controls the growth and development of many cells and cell lineages.
Dysregulation of the components of the ECS may result in uncontrolled proliferation, adhesion, invasion, inhibition of apoptosis and increased vascularization, leading to the development of various malignancies.
Cancer is the disease of uncontrolled cell division.
In this review, we will discuss whether the changes to the ECS are a cause or a consequence of malignization and whether different tissues react differently to changes in the ECS.
We will discuss the potential use of cannabinoids for treatment of cancer, focusing on primary outcome/care-tumor shrinkage and eradication, as well as secondary outcome/palliative care-improvement of life quality, including pain, appetite, sleep, and many more factors.
Finally, we will complete this review with the chapter on sex- and gender-specific differences in ECS and response to cannabinoids, and equality of the access to treatments with cannabinoids.
