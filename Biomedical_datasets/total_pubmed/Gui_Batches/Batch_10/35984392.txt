Nanfeng tangerine (Citrus reticulata Blanco) is highly regarded for its nutritional and economic value.
In January 2022, an unknown fruit rot was observed on Nanfeng tangerine fruits harvested from Nanfeng County (27.22 °N, 116.53 °E), Fuzhou City, Jiangxi Province after 70 days in storage (25 °C, 90% relative humidity).
The disease mostly started from the pedicel or a wound.
Symptoms initiated with dark brown lesions that rapidly expanded between the fruit center and pulp capsule causing total fruit rot.
The surface of symptomatic fruit was sterilized with 75% ethanol for 30 s and 2% NaClO for 30 s. Small diseased tissue pieces (2 mm2) between diseased and healthy tissues were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and put in an incubator (25 ± 1 °C) for 3 days.
The representative isolate NFMJ-1 was subcultured onto PDA using single-spore purification.
Colonies on PDA were light yellow to white, with abundant flocculent aerial hyphae.
Microconidia were oval, obovoid to allantoid, 0 septate, occasionally 1 septate, 4.07 to 17.53 × 1.69 to 3.56 μm (average=7.40 μm × 2.55 μm, n=50).
Macroconidia were slender, with a beaked apical cell and a foot-shaped basal cell, 3 to 5 septate, 22.99 to 81.12 × 2.34 to 3.81 μm (average=45.04 μm × 3.12 μm, n=50).
According to morphological characteristics, the isolate was tentatively identified as Fusarium sp.
To confirm the identification, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF), RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2), beta-tubulin gene (TUB2), and calmodulin gene (CaM) sequences were amplified with primers ITS1/ITS4 (Gardes et al. 1993)
, TEF1/TEF2 (O'Donnell et al. 2010), RPB2-5f2/RPB2-7cr (Liu et al. 1999), Bt2a/Bt2b (Glass and Donaldson 1995), and CL1C/CL2C (Weir et al. 2012), respectively.
The obtained sequences (ON184033, ON212051, ON212052, ON212053, ON212054) showed homology with F. concentricum ITS (MW016417.1; 514/514 bp),
TEF (MK609902.1; 667/667 bp), RPB2 (LC631461.1; 941/972 bp), TUB2 (MT942588.1; 331/337 bp), and CaM (MK609916.1; 558/597 bp).
A phylogenetic analysis of concatenated ITS-RPB2-TEF sequences was performed by MEGA7.0 with the maximum likelihood and Kimura 2-parameter model, revealing that the isolate was placed in the F. concentricum clade.
To confirm pathogenicity, 36 healthy tangerine fruits were surface sterilized with 75% alcohol, then 18 disinfected fruits were wounded with sterile needles and 18 remained unwounded.
Half of the wounded and un-wounded fruits were inoculated with 10 μL of a conidial suspension (1.0 × 106 conidia/ml) of isolate NFMJ-1 cultured for 7 days on PDA.
Half of the wounded and un-wounded fruits were mock-inoculated with sterile water as controls.
After incubation in an incubator (25 ± 1°C, 90% relative humidity) for 7 days, the wounded fruits inoculated with F. concentricum showed similar symptoms to the original diseased fruits, while the mock-inoculated fruits were asymptomatic.
The pathogenicity test was repeated three times.
The pathogen was re-isolated from the wound-inoculated fruits and identified as F. concentricum by morphological and molecular analysis, completing Koch's postulates.
F. concentricum has been reported as a pathogen of Podocarpus macrophyllus (Dong et al. 2022), Capsicum annuum (Wang et al. 2013) and Zea mays (Du et al. 2020) in China.
This is the first report of fruit rot caused by F. concentricum on Citrus reticulata in China.
Appropriate prevention and control measure of the pathogen need to be developed to preserve marketability of this economically important citrus fruit.
