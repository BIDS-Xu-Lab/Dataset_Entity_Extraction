Of the patients who had had a urodynamic examination during the five year period from 1982 to 1987 in our clinic, 48 patients underwent operations for rectal cancer prior to the study.
In 35 of them, the operation mode was known.
If the pelvic nerve is damaged by operative modes for rectal cancer, urinary disturbances of severe kinds may occur.
In spite of such disturbances, 71.4% of those who had had excision of the low anterior part and 51.9% of those with Miles' operation could be weaned from the clean intermittent self-catheterization and take up spontaneous urination.
Even in patients who developed severe dysuria, if catheterized at an early stage, many of them could urinate by abdominal pressure with in several months after operation, without the aid of a catheter.
This transition took place mostly within one year after operation.
When a patient develops dysuria after radical surgery for rectum cancer, treatment mainly with self-catheterization is an effective method at present.
