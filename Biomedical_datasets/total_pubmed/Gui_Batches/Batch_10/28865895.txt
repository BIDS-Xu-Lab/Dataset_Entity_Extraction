We aim to evaluate the contemporary role and outcomes of balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV), based on physician intent, for the management of severe aortic stenosis.
This is a prospective, 2-center study of 100 consecutive high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent BAV.
Before BAV, physicians assigned intent as (1) bridge to decision (BTD); (2) therapeutic bridge to planned therapy; or (3) palliation.
Patients in the BTD arm underwent clinical assessment at 30 days to determine eligibility for definitive valve therapy.
All patients were followed up to 1 year, with outcomes measured including procedural complications, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaires scores, 30-day and 1-year mortality, and definitive valve therapy.
Enrolled patients had a mean age of 80.6 (±9.6) years, Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality of 11.4% (±7.1%), and 91 (91.0%) patients had class III or IV New York Heart Association congestive heart failure.
Intent in the 100 study patients was 76 BTD; 20 therapeutic bridge to planned therapy; and 4 palliation.
Thirty-day mortality for all patients was 6 of 100 (6.0%), and 1-year mortality for all patients who received definitive valve therapy was 6 of 54 (11.1%).
For patients surviving to 30 days, adjusted (by Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality)
Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaires scores were significantly improved from baseline for all patients and BTD patients.
In conclusion, as a bridge to decision and treatment tool, BAV appears to have a valuable role in properly selecting and improving patients to undergo definitive valve replacement.
