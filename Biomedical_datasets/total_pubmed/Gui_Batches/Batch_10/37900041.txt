SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination of homeless people are a serious public health concern during COVID-19 pandemic.
We aimed to systematically assess SARS-CoV-2 incidence, seroprevalence, and COVID-19 vaccination coverage in homeless people, which are important to inform resource allocation and policy adjustment for the prevention and control of COVID-19.
We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and the World Health Organization COVID-19 database for the studies of SARS-CoV-2 incidence, seroprevalence, and COVID-19 vaccination coverage in the homeless population.
Subgroup analyses were conducted to pool SARS-CoV-2 incidence and seroprevalence in sheltered homeless, unsheltered homeless, and mixed population, respectively.
Potential sources of heterogeneity in the estimates were explored by meta-regression analysis.
Forty-nine eligible studies with a total of 75,402 homeless individuals and 5,000 shelter staff were included in the meta-analysis.
The pooled incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 10% (95% CI: 7 to 12%) in the homeless population and 8% (5 to 12%) for shelter staff.
In addition, the overall estimated SARS-CoV-2 specific seroprevalence was 19% (8 to 33%) for homeless populations and 22% (3 to 52%) for shelter staff, respectively.
Moreover, for the homeless subjects, the pooled incidence was 10% (4 to 23%) for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, 6% (1 to 12%) for symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, 3% (1 to 4%) for hospitalization for COVID-19, and 1% (0 to 2%) for severe COVID-19 cases, respectively while no COVID-19-related death was reported.
Furthermore, the data derived from 12 included studies involving 225,448 homeless individuals revealed that the pooled proportion of one dose COVID-19 vaccination was 41% (35 to 47%), which was significantly lower than those in the general population.
Our study results indicate that the homeless people remain highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but COVID-19 vaccination coverage was lower than the general population, underscoring the need for prioritizing vaccine deployment and implementing enhanced preventive measures targeting this vulnerable group.
