In German nursing homes dementia care is gaining increasing relevance.
Dementia care is known to bear the high risk of a substantial occupational burden among nursing staff.
Within this context, the "nurses' satisfaction with the care for residents with dementia" is investigated.
Secondary data of the German 3q-study is used to assess degrees of nurses' satisfaction with the care for residents with dementia and potential work related predictors.
Data from 813 nurses and nursing aides working in 53 nursing homes were included.
42% of all nursing staff was dissatisfied with the care for residents with dementia in their institution, however, pronounced differences were found between the institutions.
Registered nurses and nurses in leading positions were more dissatisfied.
A multiple regression analysis indicates that high "quantitative demands", low "leadership quality" and "social interaction with other professions" are strong predictors for nurses' satisfaction with the care for residents with dementia.
No association was found for "emotional demands" and "possibilities for development".
The results indicate that the "nurses" satisfaction with the care for residents with dementia" may be a highly relevant work factor for nursing staff in nursing homes which deserves additional attention in practice and research.
The high predictive power of several work organisational factors implies that preventive action should also include work organisational factors.
