Nanostructured devices and nanoparticles have fundamentally reshaped the development of precision healthcare in recent decades.
Meanwhile, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has evolved from simple protein sequencing to a powerful approach that identifies disease patterns and signatures, reveals molecular mechanisms of pathological processes, and develops therapeutic or preventive drugs.
Significantly, the two distinct disciplines have synergized and expanded our knowledge about human health and disease, as evidenced by a variety of nanotechnology-assisted sample processing strategies, facilitating in-depth proteome profiling and post-translational modifications (PTMs) characterization.
This review summarizes recent advances in nanoparticle design for better enrichment of marker proteins and their PTMs from various bio-specimens and emerging nanotechnologies that are applied to MS-based proteomics for precision medicine discovery.
