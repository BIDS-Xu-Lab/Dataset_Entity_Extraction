To investigate the longitudinal changes in choroidal vascularity index (CVI) in eyes with active and quiescent intermediate uveitis using enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT).
EDI-OCT images of eyes with active and quiescent intermediate uveitis were retrospectively reviewed and binarized using ImageJ software.
Choroidal parameters including CVI, total choroidal area (TCA), luminal area (LA), stromal area (SA), and subfoveal choroidal thickness (SCT) were measured and compared between baseline and follow-up visits among eyes with active and quiescent intermediate uveitis.
Thirty-eight eyes from 21 patients with active intermediate uveitis and 30 eyes from 17 patients with quiescent intermediate uveitis were included.
CVI in eyes with active intermediate uveitis significantly increased from baseline (66.50% ± 3.40%) with resolution of inflammation on follow-up (68.82% ± 3.90%; P < 0.001).
In eyes with quiescent intermediate uveitis at baseline eyes, CVI did not significantly change after follow-up (66.34% ± 3.19% to 66.25% ± 3.13%; P = 0.850).
CVI significantly increased when active inflammation in intermediate uveitis resolved while CVI remained unchanged at follow-up in quiescent intermediate uveitis.
CVI may be a useful noninvasive tool to monitor treatment response in intermediate uveitis.
Our findings also highlight the involvement of choroidal vasculature in uveitic eyes without any clinical evidence of choroiditis.
