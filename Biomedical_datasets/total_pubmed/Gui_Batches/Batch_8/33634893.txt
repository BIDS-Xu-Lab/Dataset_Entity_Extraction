The explosive growth in medical devices, imaging and diagnostics, computing, and communication and information technologies in drug development and healthcare has created an ever-expanding data landscape that the pharmacometrics (PMX) research community must now traverse.
The tools of machine learning (ML) have emerged as a powerful computational approach in other data-rich disciplines but its effective utilization in the pharmaceutical sciences and PMX modelling is in its infancy.
ML-based methods can complement PMX modelling by enabling the information in diverse sources of big data, e.g. population-based public databases and disease-specific clinical registries, to be harnessed because they are capable of efficiently identifying salient variables associated with outcomes and delineating their interdependencies.
ML algorithms are computationally efficient, have strong predictive capabilities and can enable learning in the big data setting.
ML algorithms can be viewed as providing a computational bridge from big data to complement PMX modelling.
This review provides an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of ML approaches vis-Ã -vis population methods, assesses current research into ML applications in the pharmaceutical sciences and provides perspective for potential opportunities and strategies for the successful integration and utilization of ML in PMX.
