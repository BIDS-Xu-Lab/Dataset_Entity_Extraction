Pollination provided by bees is a critical ecosystem service for agricultural production.
However, bee populations are at risk from stressors such as habitat loss, pesticides, and disease.
On-farm wildflower plantings is one mitigation strategy to provide habitat and resources for bees.
In many instances, government programs can subsidize the installation of these plantings for private landowners.
Semi-natural habitat (SNH) in the landscape is also important for bee conservation and may alter the effectiveness of wildflower plantings.
In this study, we tested the effectiveness of wildflower plantings and interactions with SNH in the landscape for promoting bee abundance and richness.
Bee surveys were conducted over 2 yr at 22 sites in eastern Virginia and Maryland.
Wildflower plantings, averaging 0.22 ha in size, were installed and maintained by cooperators at 10 of the sites.
In total, 5,122 bees were identified from 85 species.
Wildflower plantings did not alter bee communities independently, but bee abundance was greater on farms with plantings and 20-30% SNH in the landscape.
Bee abundance and richness had nonlinear responses to increasing SNH in the landscape.
The positive effects for richness and abundance peaked when SNH was approximately 40% of the landscape.
Similar to predictions of the intermediate-landscape complexity hypothesis, increases in bee abundance at wildflower sites were only detected in simplified landscapes.
Results indicate that small wildflower plantings in the Mid-Atlantic U.S. only provided conservation benefits to bee communities under specific circumstances on the scale studied, and that conserving SNH across the landscape may be a more important strategy.
