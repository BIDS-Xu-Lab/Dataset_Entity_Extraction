One of the main problems faced by transplantation medicine is the lack of suitable donor organs.
The success of organ transplantation depends on the quality of the organ to be transplanted.
The initial function of the transplant depends on the quality of preparation.
The aim of efforts after brain death is to maintain the morphological and functional integrity of the donor organ in situ.
At our clinic, all potential organ donors undergo direct arterial pressure measurement and many receive a Swan-Ganz catheter.
Catecholamine administration--varied on the basis of the hemodynamic parameters--is not associated with an impairment of organ function.
Electrolyte determinations at 2-hour intervals and close laboratory controls are obligatory.
These intensive-care measures are necessary because of the occurrence of severe metabolic and hemodynamic imbalances.
A partly transient diabetes insipidus is the most frequent homeostatic disorder.
In addition, severe electrolyte imbalances, disturbed glucose utilization and hypotension may be observed.
Our investigations on the plasma concentration course of thyroid hormones, ACTH and cortisol after the onset of brain death suggest that the secretion of pituitary hormones is maintained until total necrosis of the pituitary gland occurs 30 to 40 hours later.
The detection of circulating ADH up to 24 hours after the onset of brain death, despite the angiographically confirmed cessation of cerebral circulation, suggests that there may be a residual perfusion of hypothalamus and pituitary.
The blood levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine measured in brain-dead patients not receiving catecholamines were in part considerably above the reference level.
Our data suggest that vigorous intensive care management increases the number and quality of organs suitable for transplantation and reduces to a minimum the incidence of premature organ losses.
