The formulation of the density matrix functional theory (DMFT) in which the correlation component U of the electron-electron repulsion energy is expressed in terms of a model two-electron density cumulant matrix (a.k.a.
[Formula: see text] and the tensor of two-electron integrals  is critically analyzed.
[Formula: see text](1) of natural spinorbitals, and its concomitant invariance to the nature of the spin-independent interparticle interaction potential that enters the definition of  are emphasized.
[Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] is the spin-flip operator.
The presence of spin polarization imposes additional constraints upon [Formula: see text], including a simple condition that, when satisfied, assures the underlying wavefunction being an eigenstate of both the [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] operators with the eigenvalues [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively.
This feature allows targeting electronic states with definite multiplicities, which is virtually impossible in the case of the Kohn-Sham implementation of density functional theory.
Among the four possible pairing schemes for the natural spinorbitals that give rise to approximations employing [Formula: see text] with only two independent indices, three are found to result in unphysical constraints even for spin-unpolarized systems, whereas the failure of the fourth one turns out to be precipitated by the presence of spin polarization.
Consequently, any implementation of DMFT based upon "two-index" [Formula: see text] is shown to be generally unsuitable for spin-polarized systems (and incapable of yielding the spin-parallel components of U for the spin-unpolarized ones).
A clear distinction is made between the genuine 1-matrix functionals that are defined for arbitrary N-representable 1-matrices and general energy expressions that depend on auxiliary quantities playing the role of fictitious 1-matrices subject to additional (often unphysical) constraints.
