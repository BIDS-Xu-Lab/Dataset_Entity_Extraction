Many advances in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes have been realized over recent years.
In ST elevation myocardial infarction, new aggressive thrombolytic regimens improve early reperfusion and improve survival.
The current focus is on bolus thrombolysis, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition, and low-molecular-weight heparin as adjuncts.
In unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, two major advances are IIb/IIIa inhibition and low-molecular-weight heparin, each of which significantly improves the outcome of patients and which have just been approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration.
Following acute coronary syndromes, cholesterol lowering with statin drugs has a major effect, even in the large group of patients with average cholesterol levels.
Use of clopidogrel, a more potent antiplatelet agent than aspirin, appears to decrease recurrent ischemic events, which has highlighted the potential benefits of oral IIb/IIIa inhibitors, which are much more potent antiplatelet agents.
An additional focus has been on ensuring that patients actually receive the currently available medications.
With a great number of new medical treatments, the outcome of patients with acute coronary syndromes has improved and will continue to improve as we enter the next millennium.
