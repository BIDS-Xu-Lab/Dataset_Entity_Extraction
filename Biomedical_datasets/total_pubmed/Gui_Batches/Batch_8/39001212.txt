In recent years, preoperative planning has undergone significant advancements, with a dual focus: improving the accuracy of implant placement and enhancing the prediction of functional outcomes.
These breakthroughs have been made possible through the development of advanced processing methods for 3D preoperative images.
These methods not only offer novel visualization techniques but can also be seamlessly integrated into computer-aided design models.
Additionally, the refinement of motion capture systems has played a pivotal role in this progress.
These "markerless" systems are more straightforward to implement and facilitate easier data analysis.
Simultaneously, the emergence of machine learning algorithms, utilizing artificial intelligence, has enabled the amalgamation of anatomical and functional data, leading to highly personalized preoperative plans for patients.
The shift in preoperative planning from 2D towards 3D, from static to dynamic, is closely linked to technological advances, which will be described in this instructional review.
Finally, the concept of 4D planning, encompassing periarticular soft tissues, will be introduced as a forward-looking development in the field of orthopedic surgery.
