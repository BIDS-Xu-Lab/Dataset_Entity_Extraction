Most traditional practices in Africa, sustained and fuelled by underdevelopment, ignorance, illiteracy, poverty and tenacious customs, have been on the decline except for female genital mutilation (FGM).
To ascertain the prevalence and operators of female genital mutilation (FGM).
A cross sectional study was carried out in a semi-urban town in Rivers State of Nigeria between January and April 1988, utilizing structured questionnaires which were randomly distributed.
The response of 600 respondents was analyzed.
Prevalence of FGM amongst the study population was 53.2%.
Medical doctors were the most mentioned operators (34.5%) followed by traditional birth attendants (33.8%).
Control of excess female sexual desires (58.2%) and promotion of culture (39.5%) were the major reasons adduced for this practice.
The enforcement of the World Health Organization (WHO) legislation against medicalization of this practice is advocated.
Training and retraining of traditional birth attendants with emphases on eradication of harmful cultural practices will help.
