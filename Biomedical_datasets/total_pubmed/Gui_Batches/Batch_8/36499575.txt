In order to sustain motility and prepare for fertilization, sperm require energy.
The characterization of sperm ATP production and usage in mouse species revealed substantial differences in metabolic pathways that can be differentially affected by capacitation.
Moreover, spermatozoa encounter different environments with varying viscoelastic properties in the female reproductive tract.
Here, we examine whether viscosity affects sperm ATP levels and kinematics during capacitation in vitro.
Sperm from three mouse species (Mus musculus, M. spretus, M. spicilegus) were incubated under capacitating conditions in a modified Tyrode's medium containing bicarbonate, glucose, pyruvate, lactate, and bovine serum albumin (mT-BH) or in a bicarbonate-free medium as a non-capacitating control.
Viscosity was increased with the inclusion of polyvinylpyrrolidone.
ATP was measured with a bioluminescence kit, and kinematics were examined with a computer-aided sperm analysis system.
In M. musculus sperm, ATP declined during capacitation, but no differences were found between non-capacitating and capacitating sperm.
In contrast, in M. spretus and M. spicilegus, ATP levels decreased in capacitating sperm.
Increasing viscosity in the medium did not modify the timing or proportion of cells undergoing capacitation but did result in additional time- and concentration-dependent decreases in ATP in M. spretus and M. spicilegus under capacitating conditions.
Additionally, increased viscosity altered both velocity and trajectory descriptors.
The limited impact of capacitation and higher viscosity on M. musculus sperm ATP and kinematics could be related to the low intensity of postcopulatory sexual selection in this species.
Responses seen in the other two species could be linked to the ability of their sperm to perform better under enhanced selective pressures.
