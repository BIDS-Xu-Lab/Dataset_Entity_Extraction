Impressive clinical reports have come from several major spinal research centers regarding the results of using the AO spinal internal fixator, a recently released pedicle screw rod system.
A retrospective review of the first 2 years of clinical results from a diverse group of orthopedic surgeons using this device at a Canadian University center may provide some insight into potential clinical outcomes in general use.
These results contrast with the outcome data provided to date, which have been presented by expert academic spinal surgeons.
The results suggest that there may be room for considering limited release of this device, perhaps with the requirement for special certification in its application.
