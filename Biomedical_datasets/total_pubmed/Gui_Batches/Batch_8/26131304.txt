Although minimalist footwear is increasingly popular among runners, claims that minimalist footwear enhances running biomechanics and efficiency are controversial.
Minimalist and barefoot conditions improve running efficiency when compared with traditional running shoes.
Fifteen experienced runners each completed three 90-second running trials on a treadmill, each trial performed in a different type of footwear: traditional running shoes with a heavily cushioned heel, minimalist running shoes with minimal heel cushioning, and barefoot (socked).
High-speed photography was used to determine foot strike, ground contact time, knee angle, and stride cadence with each footwear type.
Runners had more rearfoot strikes in traditional shoes (87%) compared with minimalist shoes (67%) and socked (40%) (P = 0.03).
Ground contact time was longest in traditional shoes (265.9 ± 10.9 ms) when compared with minimalist shoes (253.4 ± 11.2 ms) and socked (250.6 ± 16.2 ms) (P = 0.005).
There was no difference between groups with respect to knee angle (P = 0.37) or stride cadence (P = 0.20).
When comparing running socked to running with minimalist running shoes, there were no differences in measures of running efficiency.
When compared with running in traditional, cushioned shoes, both barefoot (socked) running and minimalist running shoes produce greater running efficiency in some experienced runners, with a greater tendency toward a midfoot or forefoot strike and a shorter ground contact time.
Minimalist shoes closely approximate socked running in the 4 measurements performed.
With regard to running efficiency and biomechanics, in some runners, barefoot (socked) and minimalist footwear are preferable to traditional running shoes.
