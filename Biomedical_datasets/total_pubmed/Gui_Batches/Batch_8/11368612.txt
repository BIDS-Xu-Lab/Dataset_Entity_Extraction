The interactions between saliva components and 20 aroma compounds in water and oil model systems were systematically evaluated as a function of saliva composition and saliva/model system ratio.
Air/liquid partition coefficients of dimethyl sulfide, 1-propanol, diacetyl, 2-butanone, ethyl acetate, 1-butanol, 2-pentanol, propyl acetate, 3-methyl-1-butanol, ethyl butyrate, hexanal, butyl acetate, 1-hexanol, 2-heptanone, heptanal, alpha-pinene, 2-octanone, octanal, 2-nonanol, and 2-decanone were determined by static headspace gas chromatography.
Chain length of compounds within the homologous series determined the extent of interactions with the model system or saliva.
Salts in the artificial saliva hardly interacted with aroma compounds.
On the other hand, saliva proteins lowered retention of highly volatile compounds and increased retention of less volatile, hydrophobic compounds.
Significant differences in volatility of compounds when artificial saliva or water was added indicated that saliva could not be sufficiently replaced by water.
The model system/saliva ratio influenced air/liquid partitioning of the aroma compounds significantly for both model systems.
Although saliva composition affected volatility of the aroma compounds, the saliva/model system ratio was of much greater influence.
