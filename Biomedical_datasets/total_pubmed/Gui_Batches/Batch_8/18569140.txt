Portuguese norms for the Waterloo-Stanford Group C (WSGC) scale of hypnotic susceptibility are presented.
A Portuguese translation of this scale was given to 625 Portuguese college students.
Score distribution, item analysis, and reliability of the WSGC are presented and compared to three North American samples.
The findings show that normative data from the Portuguese sample are congruent with the reference samples.
The only significant difference obtained was a lower proportion of participants scoring within the high range of hypnotic suggestibility on the WSGC.
