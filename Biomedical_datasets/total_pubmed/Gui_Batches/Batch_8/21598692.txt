Chromatin diminution (CD) in two Cyclopoida species, Cyclops kolensis and C. insignis, was studied by static digital Feulgen cytophotometry.
DNA content (pg/cell) was evaluated by standard curves builded up using blood cells of five organisms with known DNA content, which ranged from 1.25 to 14.70 pg.
According to data obtained, diploid genome of C. kolensis has about 40 pg DNA before CD and 1.8-2.0 pg DNA after CD.
These values are similar for both Moscow and Baikal populations of C. kolensis and 6-10 times exceed estimates made earlier (Grishanin, 2008), Our data confirm that CD in C. kolensis is 94-96% of DNA.
In mitotic dividing cells of C. insignis, DNA content was about 7.5 pg both in early and late embryos, and CD was not revealed for this species.
The data obtained show that, among Cyclopoida studied, the genome of C. kolensis before CD has a maximum content of DNA.
