The new criteria to classify and diagnose primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) proposed by International Society Geographical & Epidemiological Ophthalmology (ISGEO) brought about not only new concept but also huge impact on Chinese traditional classification established in 1987.
The controversy between these two systems has baffled Chinese ophthalmologists in years of clinical practice.
The new criteria obviously has some concepts not suitable and not practical for Chinese PACG patients.
However, domestic studies based on traditional classification are not internationally valued or accepted.
Chinese own evidence-based clinical trials are urgently needed to elucidate the pros and cons of two classification systems.
