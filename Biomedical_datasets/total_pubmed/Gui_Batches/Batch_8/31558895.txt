Residual breast tissue after mastectomy is a problem since breast cancer can arise from it.
The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and location of residual breast tissue following modified radical mastectomy.
111 consecutive breast cancer patients who underwent mastectomy were enrolled in this study.
During surgery, after removal of the breast tissue and before skin closure, a 1-cm<sup>2</sup> tissue sample was obtained from each quadrant under the skin flaps.
These samples were evaluated histopathologically for the presence of any residual breast tissue.
Residual breast tissue was detected in the tissue samples of 12/111 (10.8%) patients.
4 of these patients had residual breast tissue in all 4 quadrants.
6 patients had residual tissue in a single quadrant.
With 9 positive biopsy results, the upper medial quadrant was the most frequently involved location.
The other quadrants had 6 positive biopsy results each.
At the end of a median of 20 months of follow-up, none of these patients developed breast cancer recurrences.
Mastectomy has a high probability of residual breast tissue being left behind.
Physicians should be aware of this and act accordingly when planning surgical or follow-up treatment.
