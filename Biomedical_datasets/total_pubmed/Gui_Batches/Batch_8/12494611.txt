Fascicular VT and RVOT tachycardia are sometimes difficult to induce by programmed electrical stimulation (PES), despite pharmacologic provocation.
In such instances, catheter mapping is hampered and efficacy of catheter ablation is difficult to judge.
The study included nine patients who presented with incessant idiopathic VT and were directly taken to the electrophysiological laboratory for RF ablation.
During the same period, elective ablation was performed on 108 patients with idiopathic VT.
The success rate, procedural and fluoroscopy times number of energies, and the peak temperature were evaluated and compared.
Of the nine patients, seven had incessant fascicular VT and two had RVOT tachycardia.
+/- 6 ms relative to surface QRS complexes.
A fascicular potential was not seen in three of the seven patients with fascicular VT.
+/- 32 minutes and 144 +/- 40 minutes (P = 0.023) while the fluoroscopy time was 14.6 +/- 4.6 minutes and 30 +/- 16 minutes (P < 0.001), respectively, in the primary ablation and elective groups.
The total number of RF energies delivered was 2.0 +/- 1.3 versus 7.4 +/- 5.6 (P = 0.07), respectively.
The significantly increased procedural time during elective ablation was largely due to time spent in fascicular VT induction.
All patients in the primary ablation group were successfully ablated and none had a recurrence.
Primary ablation is a safe and effective option in patients with incessant idiopathic VT.
Moreover, in fascicular VT, it is superior to elective ablation in terms of success, fluoroscopy and procedural times.
