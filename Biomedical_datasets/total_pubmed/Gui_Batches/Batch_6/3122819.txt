In an attempt to prevent the loss of 'overstimulated cycles' associated with human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG)-induced ovulation, oestradiol levels and ovarian follicular state were monitored in 12 women with 'overstimulated cycles' after withholding hMG for several days.
Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) was administered when oestradiol levels were less than or equal to 1700 pg/ml and the leading follicles between 17 and 22 mm in diameter.
During the withholding period follicular growth continued in all patients, while oestradiol levels declined in all but three.
Ovulation was observed in six additional women.
Ovarian hyperstimulation did not occur in any of the 12 patients.
We conclude that a rescue of 'overstimulated cycles' is sometimes possible.
Conception seems to depend on a continuing rise of E2 levels and early detection of 'overstimulation'.
