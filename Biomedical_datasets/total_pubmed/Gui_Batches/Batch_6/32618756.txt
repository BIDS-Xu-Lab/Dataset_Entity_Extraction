Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery is associated with mortality and major adverse postoperative cardiovascular events.
The effect of postoperative troponin concentrations on patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is unknown.
The study examined the association between immediate postoperative troponin concentrations and self-reported HRQoL 1 year after surgery.
Single-centre tertiary care hospital in the Netherlands between July 2012 and 2015.
Patients aged at least 60 years undergoing moderate and major noncardiac surgery.
HRQoL total score was assessed with the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire.
Tobit regression analysis was used to determine the association between postoperative troponin concentrations and 1-year HRQoL. Peak high-sensitivity troponin T values were divided into four categories: less than 14, 14 to 49, 50 to 149 and at least 150 ng l.
A total of 3085 patients with troponin measurements were included.
patients were alive at 1-year follow-up of whom 1297 (49.2%) returned a completed questionnaire.
The median score for HRQoL was 0.82 (0.85, 0.81, 0.77 and 0.71 per increasing troponin category).
Multivariable analysis revealed betas of -0.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.09 to -0.02], -0.11 (95% CI -0.18 to -0.04) and -0.18 (95% CI -0.29 to -0.07) for troponin levels of 14 to 49, 50 to 149 and at least 150 ng l when compared with values less than 14 ng l. Other independent predictors for lower HRQoL were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, female sex, peripheral arterial disease and increasing age.
Higher levels of postoperative troponin measured immediately after surgery were independently associated with lower self-reported HRQoL total score at 1-year follow-up.
