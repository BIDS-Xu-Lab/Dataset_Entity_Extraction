Certain strains of Bradyrhizobium japonicum produce large quantities of polysaccharide in soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.)
nodules, and nodule polysaccharide (NPS) is different from that produced in culture.
A previous survey of field-grown plants showed highly variable levels of NPS among field sites.
To obtain clues about the possible function of NPS, we conducted two additional surveys of field-grown plants.
The amount of polysaccharide in bulk samples of nodules was not associated with soil type, texture, slope, drainage, or any of the measured soil chemical properties except pH and [Ca].
Correlations with pH and [Ca] were positive and highly significant for two independent surveys involving a total of 77 sites in two years.
In a preliminary comparison of high and low levels of Ca supplied to soybean plants grown in silica sand in a greenhouse, a high level of Ca (200 mg of Ca liter) increased the NPS level and increased the Ca content of the polysaccharide fraction.
B. japonicum isolates from 450 nodules collected at 10 field sites in 1993 were used to form nodules on soybean plants grown in sand culture in a greenhouse in order to examine bacterial phenotype under controlled conditions.
Results showed that the NPS level in the bulk nodule sample from any given site was a function of the proportion of nodule occupants that were capable of NPS synthesis.
[Ca] may positively influence the survival of B. japonicum capable of synthesis of the nodule-specific polysaccharide.
