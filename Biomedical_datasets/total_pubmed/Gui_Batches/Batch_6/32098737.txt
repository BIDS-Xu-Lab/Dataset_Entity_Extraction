Tranexamic acid (TXA) has reduced blood transfusion following total hip arthroplasty (THA).
However, non-human studies have linked TXA exposure with increased pain and decreased periarticular cell viability and cell death.
A consecutive series of 213 THAs performed without TXA were compared to 169 THAs performed with topical TXA.
A single surgeon using identical perioperative medical and pain control protocols performed procedures.
Prospectively collected inpatient pain scores, time to first opioid, and opioid consumption in morphine milligram equivalents were evaluated in relation to TXA use and 10 additional covariates.
Univariate relationships between independent and dependent variables with P ≤ .20 were entered into multivariate analysis using the General Linear Model.
Patients who received topical TXA reported higher mean 24-hour pain scores compared to patients who did not receive TXA (P = .006).
Patients with topical TXA requested opioids significantly sooner (means of 152 vs 246 minutes, P = .033).
An average of 56.07 morphine milligram equivalents were consumed during the first 24 hours after post-acute care unit discharge by patients who received topical TXA compared to 31.26 by patients who did not receive TXA (P < .001).
Topical TXA use was associated with greater early postoperative pain and opioid consumption in primary THA patients.
Findings were supported by the magnitude of observed effects and the likelihood of clinical relevance.
Replication and consideration of potential adverse consequences of TXA use in elective settings is encouraged.
