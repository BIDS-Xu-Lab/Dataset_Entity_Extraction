For many years in human assisted-reproduction procedures there have been special protocols to prepare and improve sperm quality.
Colloidal centrifugation (CC) is a useful technique that has been proved to enhance semen quality by selection of the best spermatozoa for different species.
Its use is recommended to improve fertility of subfertile stallions but current CC protocols are clinically complicated in the equine sperm processing technique due to economic and technical difficulties.
The aim of this study was to determine the optimal processing procedures to adapt the use of a CC product (EquiPure™) in the equine reproduction industry.
A total of nineteen ejaculates were collected from 10 Purebred Spanish Horses (P.R.E horses) using a Missouri artificial vagina.
Gel-free semen aliquots were analyzed prior to treatment (control).
Semen was subjected to one of six CC protocols with EquiPure™ and centrifuged samples were statistically evaluated by ANOVA and Duncan tests (p<0.05) for sperm quality and recovery rate.
We obtained higher values by colloidal centrifugation in LIN, STR and BCF variables and DNA fragmentation index trended to be lower in most of the CC protocols.
The studied protocols were shown to be as efficient in improving equine sperm quality as the current commercial EquiPure™, with the added advantage of being much more economical and simple to use.
According to these results it seems to be possible to incorporate single layer and or high colloidal centrifugation volume protocols what would make them simple, economic and clinically viable for the equine sperm processing procedure.
