In an attempt to transfer the genetic components needed for taxol synthesis into a more tractable plant, protoplasts of Taxus chinensis var.
mairei were UV irradiated for various times prior to their fusion with protoplasts of Bupleurum scorzonerifolium.
Of the 60 presumptive hybrid calli obtained, selections of the 9 most rapidly growing were recognized as hybrid clones based on a combination of their callus morphology, esterase profile, chromosome number, and RAPD genotype.
The RAPD data showed that 82.4-96.8% of the hybrid genome was inherited from the recipient (B. scorzonerifolium) and 4.6-13.9% from the donor (T. chinensis), with 1.6-6.9% of the RAPD fragments being not present in either parent.
None of the hybrid clones expressed a detectable quantity of taxol, but four produced more of the triterpenoid oleanolic acid than did calli of the recipient.
With the use of semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, it was possible to show variation in the expression of several triterpenoid biosynthetic pathway related genes between B. scorzonerifolium and the hybrids.
Increasing the concentration of oleanolic acid requires that the expression levels of the genes encoding IPP isomerase, squalene synthase, squalene epoxidase and Î²-amyrin synthase are increased, while at the same time, those of the genes encoding the branching enzymes cycloartenol synthase and lupeol synthase need to be reduced.
