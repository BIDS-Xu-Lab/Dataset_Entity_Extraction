Perceived social support is associated with better mental health.
There has been limited attention to how these relationships are modified by age and gender.
We assessed this topic using 13 years of cohort data.
The outcome was the Mental Health Inventory-5 (MHI-5), a reliable and valid screening instrument for mood disorders.
The main exposure was a social support scale composed of 10 items.
We used longitudinal fixed-effects regression modelling to investigate within-person changes in mental health.
Analytic models controlled for within-person sources of bias.
We controlled for time-related factors by including them into regression modelling.
The provision of higher levels of social support was associated with greater improvements in mental health for people aged under 30 years than for older age groups.
The mental health of females appeared to benefit slightly more from higher levels of social support than males.
Improvements in the MHI-5 were on a scale that could be considered clinically significant.
The benefits of social support for young people may be connected to age-related transitions in self-identity and peer friendship networks.
Results for females may reflect their tendency to place greater emphasis on social networks than males.
