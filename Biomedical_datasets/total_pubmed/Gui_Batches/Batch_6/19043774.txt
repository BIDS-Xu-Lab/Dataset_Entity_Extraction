We report a case of successful pregnancy after rituximab in a patient with a history of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) failures and positive anti-cardiolipin antibody (ACA).
Following a course of rituximab, her ACA became negative and she successfully conceived with IVF treatment.
This is the first case in literature describing the use of rituximab therapy in this clinical scenario.
