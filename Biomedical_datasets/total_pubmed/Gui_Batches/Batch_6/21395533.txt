Metallometabolomics is an emerging field integrating the research technologies related to the comprehensive analysis of metabolites of a metallodrug in a biologically relevant sample, requiring high-throughput and targeted analyses of the transformation, speciation, localization and structural characteristics of the metallometabolites.
This review discusses the concept of metallometabolomics with a focus on analytical techniques and methods, particularly the hyphenated approaches that combine high resolution separation techniques (liquid chromatography or capillary electrophoresis) with highly sensitive detection methods such as mass spectrometry (elemental (ICP) or molecular (ESI)) or nuclear analytical methods (X-ray fluorescence/absorption/emission/diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance).
The application of these advanced analytical technologies in the speciation analysis, identity determination and structural elucidation of metallometabolites will be selectively outlined, along with their advantages and limitations.
