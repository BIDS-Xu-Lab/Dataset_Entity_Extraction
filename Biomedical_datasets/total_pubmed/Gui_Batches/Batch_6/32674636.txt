To investigate the influence of cyclosporin A (CsA) pre-treatment and etomidate (ETO) post-treatment on lung injury induced by limb ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) in rats.
Rats were randomly divided into five groups: sham, I/R, I/R+CsA, I/R+ETO, and I/R+CsA+ETO.
Limb I/R lung injury was established by bilateral clamping of the femoral arteries for 2 hours.
Following reperfusion for 3 hours, blood gas analysis was performed.
Pathological changes were assessed using immunohistochemistry.
The apoptosis index (AI) and wet/dry weight ratio (W/D) were calculated.
Levels of Fas protein and FasL mRNA were assessed by western blotting and RT-PCR, respectively.
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β were detected by ELISA.
I/R resulted in decreased PaO2 but increased AI, W/D, Fas, FasL mRNA, TNF-α and IL-1β.
Scattered punctate apoptosis and necrosis were observed by immunohistochemistry.
Compared with the I/R group, the I/R+ETO and I/R+CsA groups showed increased SpO2, decreased AI, W/D, Fas, FasL mRNA, TNF-α and IL-1β, and decreased numbers of apoptotic and necrotic cells.
Combined treatment with CsA+ETO resulted in more dramatic changes in these parameters.
ETO post-treatment and CsA pretreatment reduced lung injury induced by limb I/R in rats.
The mechanism may be related to synergistic inhibition of Fas/FasL signaling.
