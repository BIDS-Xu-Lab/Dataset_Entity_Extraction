Families caring for a frail elderly loved one at home face numerous problems and crises and often become incapacitated, sometimes breaking down completely, in their efforts to cope.
Research indicates that education, information and referral services, and support and respite services can significantly improve coping abilities and relieve care givers' burden.
During the past eight years, the Neurological Sciences Center's Education & Family Support Services (E&FSS) of Good Samaritan Hospital and Medical Center, Portland, OR, has become a leader in developing these services for families.
E&FSS programs include Helping You Care; Caregiver Series; Caregiver Support Group; POPS;
Polishing Our People Skills; Neurological Coalition; Caregiver's Respite Program; Legal/Financial Planning class; and the E&FSS Resource Center.
The program also provides public education in the form of three major programs each year, videotapes, and fact sheets.
The program benefits the facility by providing direct revenues, referring clients to medical services and physicians, and enhancing the facility's image in the community.
