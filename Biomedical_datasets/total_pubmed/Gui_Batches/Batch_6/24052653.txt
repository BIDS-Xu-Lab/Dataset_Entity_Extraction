To implement peer-led team learning in an online course on controversial issues surrounding medications and the US healthcare system.
The course was delivered completely online using a learning management system.
Students participated in weekly small-group discussions in online forums, completed 3 reflective writing assignments, and collaborated on a peer-reviewed grant proposal project.
In a post-course survey, students reported that the course was challenging but meaningful.
Final projects and peer-reviewed assignments demonstrated that primary learning goals for the course were achieved and students were empowered to engage in the healthcare debate.
A peer-led team-learning is an effective strategy for an online course offered to a wide variety of student learners.
By shifting some of the learning and grading responsibility to students, the instructor workload for the course was rendered more manageable.
