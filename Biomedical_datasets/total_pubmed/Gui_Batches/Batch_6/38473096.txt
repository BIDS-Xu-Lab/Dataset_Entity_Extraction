The aim of this study was to monitor the behaviour of purebred and crossbred beef cattle reared in the same optimal environmental conditions according to Classyfarm®.
SRB), balanced for sex and body weight, were used.
Animals were evaluated for five months by two trained operators by SCAN ("sternal resting", "lateral resting", " central or peripheral position in the pen", standing", "walking", "feeding", "drinking", and "ruminating) and FOCUS ("displacement for space", "displacement for feed or water", "play-fighting", "self-grooming", "allo-grooming", "stereotyping", and "mounting") protocols.
Feeding behaviour was monitored by a CCTV system.
The application of the SCAN sampling evidenced that SRB animals preferred the "standing" activity over the LMS animals, while the LMS × SRB did not differ from them.
The "standing" and " ruminating "activities were observed mostly in females than males (p < 0.05).
Males showed higher (p < 0.05) n-events than females for "play-fighting".
SRB and LMS being intermediate (p < 0.05).
The duration of "eating concentrate" (expressed in minutes) was higher (p < 0.05) in females than males.
In conclusion, behaviour indicators of animal welfare did not evidence substantial differences among genetic types and between sexes reared in the same "optimal" environmental conditions.
Female beef and the autochthon's cattle breed of Sardinia, although typically hardy, showed a wide behavioural repertoire.
