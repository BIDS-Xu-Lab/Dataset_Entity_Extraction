Among 32459 deliveries from 1961 to 1975 at the Gynaecology Department of the Martin Luther University in Halle there were 194 adolescent mothers under 18 years of age.
This corresponds to a percentage of 0,6%.--These "adolescents" were compared with an equal group of primiparae between 22 and 24 years of age.--There were no essential differences in the delivery procedure between the adolescent and the control groups.
Operations to speed up delivery had to be performed less often in the adolescent than in the control group.
The quota of premature deliveries amongst the adolescents which stood a 16%, was higher than in the control group, where the quota amounted only 9%.
In both groups no differences were found in the perinatal mortality rate.
