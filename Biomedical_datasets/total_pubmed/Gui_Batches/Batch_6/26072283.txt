This study examined differences in offending behavior and psychosocial problems between juvenile offenders who have been sexually abused (n=231), physically abused (n=1,568), neglected (n=1,555), exposed to multiple forms of maltreatment (n=1,767), and non-victims (n=8,492).
In addition, the moderating effect of gender in the association between type of maltreatment and offending behavior/psychosocial problems was examined.
Results showed that violent offenses were more common in victims of physical abuse and victims of multiple forms of abuse than in non-victims, both in boys and girls.
In boys, sexual offenses were far more common in victims of sexual abuse than in victims of other or multiple forms of maltreatment or in non-victims.
In girls, no group differences were found in sexual offending behavior.
For both boys and girls, externalizing problems were relatively common in victims of physical abuse and neglect whereas internalizing problems were relatively common in victims of sexual abuse.
In victims of multiple forms of maltreatment, both internalizing and externalizing problems were relatively common.
Implications for clinical practice are discussed.
