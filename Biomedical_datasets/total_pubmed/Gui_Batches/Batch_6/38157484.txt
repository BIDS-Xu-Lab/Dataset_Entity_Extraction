We develop a DNA origami-based internal kinetic referencing system with a colocalized reference and target molecule to provide increased sensitivity and robustness for transient binding kinetics.
To showcase this, we investigate the subtle changes in binding strength of DNA oligonucleotide hybrids induced by cytosine modifications.
These cytosine modifications, especially 5-methylcytosine but also its oxidized derivatives, have been increasingly studied in the context of epigenetics.
Recently revealed correlations of epigenetic modifications and disease also render them interesting biomarkers for early diagnosis.
Internal kinetic referencing allows us to probe and compare the influence of the different epigenetic cytosine modifications on the strengths of 7-nucleotide long DNA hybrids with one or two modified nucleotides by single-molecule imaging of their transient binding, revealing subtle differences in binding times.
Interestingly, the influence of epigenetic modifications depends on their position in the DNA strand, and in the case of two modifications, effects are additive.
The sensitivity of the assay indicates its potential for the direct detection of epigenetic disease markers.
