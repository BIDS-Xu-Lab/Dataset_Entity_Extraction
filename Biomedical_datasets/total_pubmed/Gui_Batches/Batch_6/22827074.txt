In order to further assess the feasibility of monitoring the chlorophyll fluorescence parameter Fv/Fm in compact corn by hyperspectral remote sensing data, in the present study, hyperspectral vegetation indices from in-situ remote sensing measurements were utilized to monitor the chlorophyll fluorescence parameter Fv/Fm measured in the compact corn experiment.
The relationships were analyzed between hyperspectral vegetation indices and Fv/Fm, and the monitoring models were established for Fv/Fm in the whole growth stages of compact corn.
The results indicated that Fv/Fm was significantly correlated to the hyperspectral vegetation indices.
Among them, structure-sensitive pigment index (SIPI) was the most sensitive remote sensing variable for monitoring Fv/Fm with correlation coefficient (r) of 0.88.
The monitoring model of Fv/Fm was established on the base of SIPI, and the determination coefficients (r2) and the root mean square errors (RMSE) were 0.8126 and 0.082 respectively.
The overall results suggest that hyperspectral vegetation indices can be potential indicators to monitor Fv/Fm during growth stages of compact corn.
