Abdominal wall endometriosis (AWE) is a rare condition defined by the presence of endometrial tissue in the subcutaneous fatty layer and the muscles of the abdominal wall.
It is usually caused by the dissemination of endometrial tissue in the wound at the time of obstetrical and gynecological surgeries.
AWE is rare and difficult to diagnose.
The most frequent clinical presentation is that of a palpable subcutaneous mass near surgical scars associated with cyclic pain and swelling during menses.
AWE may be an underreported pathology partly because it has scarcely received attention in the radiologic literature.
Its frequency is expected to rise along with the increasing rate of cesarean deliveries; thus, it is important that physicians or sonographers are familiar with this pathology.
The purpose of our review is to present the latest data regarding risk factors, clinical and imagisticfindings, and management of AWE.
