Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has become commonly used both as a concept and as a field of research.
However, little is known about the HRQOL of men who have sex with men and women (MSMW).
The aim of this study was to examine HIV-related behaviors, social support, and HRQOL status and explore its predictors among MSMW.
An anonymous cross-sectional study was conducted by snowball sampling method in 2013.
A total of 563 Chinese MSM completed a structured questionnaire.
The HRQOL and social support were measured with the Chinese version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL-BRFE) and the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), respectively.
Of the 563 MSM analyzed, 77 (13.68%) were MSMW who had a higher proportion of in-marriage and preference for an insertive role as compared with the men who have sex with men only (MSMO) (P<0.05).
As high as 70.13% of MSMW had no regular sex partners and 72.73% of MSMW reported engaging in unprotected anal sex in the last six months.
36.36% had tested for HIV, while only 12.99% had accepted HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) services.
The scores of objective support and subjective support in MSMW were significantly higher than that of MSMO (P<0.05).
No statistically significant difference was found in scores of all the four domains of the HRQOL between MSMW and MSMO.
When comparing the HRQOL scores of MSMW with the Chinese general population reference group, the scores of MSMW were significantly lower in physical health domain.
In a multivariate regression model, age, monthly income, sexual role, VCT acceptability, subjective support were associated with variability in HRQOL.
To improve the HRQOL among MSMW, more attention needs to be paid to those with low social support, low-income, the old and those prefer a receptive role during anal sex populations.
