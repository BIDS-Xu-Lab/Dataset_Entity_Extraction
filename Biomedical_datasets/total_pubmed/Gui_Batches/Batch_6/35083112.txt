Cancer of the kidney is one of the 10 most common cancers found globally.
Overall, it is the fourth most common cancer in men and the eighth most common cancer in women.
Many kidney cancer patients experience psychologic problems and reactions.
The present study examined relationship between anxiety, depression, and perceived stress symptoms in kidney cancer patients.
Cross-sectional data were obtained from the patients diagnosed with kidney cancer.
All participants completed sociodemographic form, Hospital Anxiety and Depression form, and Perceived Stress Scale.
Statistical analysis was exercised using the Student's t-test, Chi-squared test (Ï‡2), Fischer's exact test, ANOVA, Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis one-way variance analysis.
A total of 250 patients participated in the study.
The mean age was 57.4 years (SD 6.4, range = 25-76 years).
The majority of patients were males (73%) and married (218).
Anxiety symptoms were determined in 91.2% patients, depression symptoms in 87.2% patients, and perceived stress symptoms in 93.6% patients.
The mean scores of Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale (HADS)-Anxiety, HADS-Depression, and HADS-Perceived Stress were significantly different between age (P < 0.05), gender (P < 0.05), and income groups (P < 0.001).
Kidney cancer patients showed poorer psychologic health.
The overall levels of anxiety, depression, and perceived stress symptoms were higher among the studied kidney cancer patients.
Findings of the current study could improve both psychologic well-being of patients and health-related quality of life.
