Since concentration of drugs of abuse found in the brain better reflect drug concentration at their site of action, brain specimens are useful in the determination of the role of drugs of abuse in the cause of death.
In order to allow for the routine use of brain specimens in this field, a comprehensive database with reliable reference values is needed and should include both post-mortem data for cases where drugs have been taken in therapeutic doses as well as for cases of overdose.
In this study, a semi-automated extraction procedure, in combination with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using stable isotope internal standards was applied to yield reproducible, quantitative results which could be used to investigate the distribution patterns of drugs of abuse within specific regions of the brain, by analyzing several segments of both medulla oblongata and cerebellum.
A homogenous distribution of unconjugated morphine, dihydrocodeine, and benzoylecgonine within the investigated segments of medulla oblongata or cerebellum could be found.
However, when these two brain regions from the same case were compared to each other, significantly higher concentrations of unconjugated morphine, dihydrocodeine, and benzoylecgonine were found in the cerebellum than in the medulla oblongata.
