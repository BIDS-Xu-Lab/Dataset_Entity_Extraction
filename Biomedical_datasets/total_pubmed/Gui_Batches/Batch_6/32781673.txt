Reports investigating the relationship between sarcopenic obesity and activities of daily living in older patients with stroke were limited.
This study aimed to examine the prevalence of sarcopenic obesity and its association with activities of daily living in older post-stroke patients in convalescent rehabilitation wards.
This study was performed in older post-stroke patients admitted to convalescent rehabilitation wards between January 2017 and March 2019.
Sarcopenia was diagnosed based on the skeletal muscle mass index and hand grip strength according to the criteria of the 2019 Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia.
Obesity was diagnosed according to the body fat percentage; ≥27% in men, ≥38% in women.
The primary outcome was the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score upon admission, which was analyzed using multiple linear regression.
In total, 376 participants (women 44%; mean age 77.5 years) were analyzed and classified as normal (22%), simple obesity (17%), sarcopenia without obesity (32%), and sarcopenic obesity (28%).
The presence of sarcopenic obesity was independently associated with the FIM score (95% CI, -16.157 to -5.353), whereas simple obesity and sarcopenia without obesity were not.
In conclusion, sarcopenic obesity was independently associated with lower activities of daily living capability in older patients with stroke.
