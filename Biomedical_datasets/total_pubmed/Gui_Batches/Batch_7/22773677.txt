To investigate the use of bonded molar tubes (BMTs) by specialist orthodontists.
Registered members of the Orthodontic Society of Ireland.
A questionnaire was posted to registered members of the Orthodontic Society of Ireland.
It investigated demographics, pattern of use, reasons for use and techniques for placement of BMTs.
A 74% response rate was obtained.
In more than 80% of cases, BMTs were used on first and second permanent molars by 52% and 33% of orthodontists respectively.
BMT usage was adopted by 97% of respondents in the previous decade.
Direct bonding was used by all for BMT placement.
Etch times for molars, compared to other teeth, increased from 15 to 30 seconds by 51% of orthodontists.
Of the respondents, 97% used light-cured adhesives and 17% used self-etching primers.
Molar tube holders were preferred by 54% for placement.
Only with a history of epilepsy, were bands preferred to BMTs.
BMTs were regarded as more cost-effective than molar bands by 66% of responding clinicians.
Specialist orthodontists preferred BMTs to bands on first permenent molars.
Direct bonding was favoured using a 30-second etch, a light-cured primer and adhesive with specialized molar tube holders.
BMTs were perceived to be more cost-effective than molar bands.
