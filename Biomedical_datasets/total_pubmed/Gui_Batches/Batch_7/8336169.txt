This study reports on the neurophysiological measurements that were performed in the context of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study with intravenously administered 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) in 70 patients with definite multiple sclerosis (MS).
A beneficial effect of 4-AP was found for both visual evoked response and eye movement registration parameters.
This study extends the experimental data obtained on animal nerve fibers, showing that 4-AP can improve impulse conduction in demyelinated nerve, to clinical data which indicate that 4-AP induces an objective improvement in the central nervous system function in MS-patients.
It thereby also provides a theoretical basis for clinical efficacy of 4-AP in MS.
