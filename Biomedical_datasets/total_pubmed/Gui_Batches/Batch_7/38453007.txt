Predicting the aggressiveness of meningiomas may influence the surgical strategy timing.
Because of the paucity of robust markers, the systemic immune-inflammation (SII) index is a novel biomarker to be an independent predictor of poor prognosis in various cancers including gliomas.
We aimed to investigate the value of SII as well as neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) indices in predicting prognosis.
Records including demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of patients operated on due to intracranial meningioma in 2017-2023 were retrospectively reviewed.
A total of 234 patients were included in this study.
All of SII index, NLR, and PLR values at presentation were significantly higher in grade â‰¥2 meningiomas.
A positive correlation was observed between SII index and Ki67 index (r=0.313; P<0.001); between NLR and Ki67 index (r=0.330; P<0.001); and between PLR and Ki67 index (r=0.223; P<0.01).
SII index (optimal cutoff level >618), NLR (optimal cutoff level >3.53), and PLR (optimal cutoff level >121.2) showed significant predictive values.
This is the first study to assess the prognostic value of the SII index in patients with intracranial meningiomas.
Increased SII index, NLR and PLR were correlated with higher grade and higher Ki-67 index.
They also harbor the potential to screen patients that may need more aggressive treatments or more frequent follow-up examinations.
