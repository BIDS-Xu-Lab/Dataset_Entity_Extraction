Persistent luminescent nanomaterials (PLNPs) Zn0.8Ga2O4: Cr3+, Zr3+ with high brightness and good dispersion were prepared by hydrothermal method.
The PLNPs were used as luminescent units, and CoOOH nanosheets were used as quenching agents.
Based on the fluorescence internal filtering effect, the luminescence of PLNPs were effectively quenched by CoOOH modification on the surface of PLNPs.
However, the introduction of ascorbic acid (AA) restored the luminescence of PLNPs and successfully achieved highly sensitive and selective detection of AA.
This was due to a selective redox reaction between CoOOH and AA, in which CoOOH was reduced to Co2+.
The degree of luminescence recovery of PLNPs showed a good linear relationship with AA concentration in the range 5-250 µM, with a detection limit of 0.72 µM. The recovery of actual spiked samples were 97.9-102.2%.
This method is expected to provide reference for the study of other redox substances in biological systems.
