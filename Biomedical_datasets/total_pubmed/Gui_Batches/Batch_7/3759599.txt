Research into the psychosocial correlates of glycemic control in youth with insulin-dependent diabetes has been variable in outcome.
The present study tested the hypothesis that psychosocial correlates will vary with the individual's developmental stage.
Psychosocial measures completed by or about youth, parents, and family were regressed against glycosylated hemoglobin (Ghb), an index of glycemic control.
Correlation sets based on age (8-10, 11-13, and 14-16 years) were tested for overall significance.
One of the three sets originating from youth and one of six from parents attained setwise significance, allowing interpretation of individually significant coefficients.
Relationships within these sets provided limited confirmation of the initial proposition.
Health locus of control beliefs in 8-10 year olds, and parental continuity and consistency of expectations and affirmations of structure and organization within the 11-13-year-old group, were salient correlates of Ghb, suggesting a potential focus for preventive/supportive family assistance.
