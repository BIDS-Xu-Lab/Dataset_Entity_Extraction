With extensive Hispanic community involvement, a television, radio, and storybook novela were developed to improve Hispanic parent-youth communications and youth attitudes regarding alcohol.
Focus groups with the target audiences determined the novelas' concentration on alcohol, their medium and language of choice for Hispanic youth versus parents, and the health messages and cultural values to be portrayed.
Reactions to the novelas were obtained via self-report surveys, random street interviews, radio listener call-ins, and community group meetings.
Favorable reactions were obtained regarding the novelas' cultural sensitivity and appropriateness, and their potential to affect future behavior change.
The affect of the television novela on Hispanic youth was evaluated by a pre-post self-report survey administered to middle and high school students.
Survey results indicated the television novela may have had some positive impact on Hispanic youth attitudes and behavioral intentions regarding alcohol.
The evaluation time line was limiting, however, and further evaluation is required.
