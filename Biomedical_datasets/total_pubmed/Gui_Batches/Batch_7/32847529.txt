Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) caused by a pathogenic variant in UMOD (ADTKD-UMOD) is a rare group of diseases characterized by hyperuricaemia with decreased urinary excretion of urate, gout and progressive chronic kidney disease.
The mundane clinical characteristics often result in a failure to diagnose ADTKD-UMOD.
In this report, we describe a 12-year-old boy who presented with polyarthritis, hyperuricaemia and tophi with a family history of 8 affected individuals.
Clinical data, blood and urine samples of 3 affected members and 8 unaffected members were collected.
Genetic testing of the eight genes (UMOD, HPRT1, PRPS1, MTHFR, REN, HNF1b, URAT1 and G6PC) was performed using Sanger sequencing.
A heterozygous missense variant (c.674C > G; p.T225R) in UMOD was found in this boy, his older brother with the same phenotype and his mother with hyperuricaemia, gout and chronic kidney disease.
This case highlights the importance of family history and genetic testing for definite diagnosis.
This novel variant extends the spectrum of known UMOD gene variants and further supports the allelic heterogeneity of ADTKD-UMOD.
