Recent experiments indicate that in contrast to αβT cells, γδT cell effector functions are largely preprogrammed in the thymus during fetal life.
However the thymus also exports juvenile γδT cells that can mature and be polarized in the periphery.
How these developmental pathways are regulated and how much they contribute to the γδT cell effector pool is unclear.
Here we discuss recent advances in the understanding of γδT cell subset development, with particular focus on IL-17-producing γδT cells and their beneficial and pathogenic roles in immunity.
