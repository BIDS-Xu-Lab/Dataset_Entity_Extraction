Our purpose was to review needle aspiration of breast abscesses and identify factors associated with treatment by aspiration alone versus aspiration with surgical incision and drainage (I/D).
This Institutional Review Board-approved, retrospective review of the breast ultrasound database from 2008 to 2010 identified 40 patients (41 abscesses) who underwent aspiration, with or without I/D. Demographics, imaging, number of aspirations, and microbiology were reviewed.
Twenty-two abscesses underwent aspiration only, 16 > 3 cm, 6 ≤ 3 cm (mean 4.3 cm, range 0.9-10 cm).
Known risk factors included lactational (11), 3 weeks post partum (1), pregnancy (1), recent biopsy/lumpectomy (5).
Nineteen abscesses underwent aspiration and I/D, 15 > 3 cm, 4 ≤ 3 cm (mean 4.1 cm, range 2.2-7.5 cm).
Known risk factors included lactational (4), recurrent subareolar abscess (4), diabetes (3), hydradenitis suppuritiva (1), nipple piercing (2), smoking (1), pregnancy (1), HIV (1), and lumpectomy (1).
Identified reasons for I/D included lack of improvement/recurrence (12), fistula (3), and one electively after clinical improvement of a recurrent subareolar abscess.
Abscesses associated with pregnancy and lactation or breast biopsy are effectively managed with aspiration, even when large.
Recurrence, chronicity, or fistula may require surgical intervention.
