In the urban-rural fringe of the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, rapid urbanization is creating a land-use mixture of agricultural fields and residential areas.
To develop appropriate policies to enhance recycling of municipal solid waste (MSW), current MSW management was investigated in the oboto (local administrative district) of Bang Maenang in Nonthaburi Province, adjoining Bangkok.
The authors conducted a structural interview survey with waste-related organizations and local residents, analysed household waste generation, and performed global positioning system (GPS) tracking of municipal garbage trucks.
It was found that MSW was collected and treated by local government, private-sector entities, and the local community separately.
Lack of integrated management of these entities complicated waste flow in the study area, and some residences were not served by MSW collection.
Organic waste, such as kitchen garbage and yard waste, accounted for a large proportion of waste generation but was underutilized.
Through GPS/GIS analysis, the waste collection rate of the generated waste amount was estimated to be 45.5- 51.1% of total generation.
