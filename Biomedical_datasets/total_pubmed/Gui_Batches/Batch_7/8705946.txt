IN THIS ARTICLE, how one home health agency developed services for a high-risk group of clients based on a research study conducted on-site is described.
Part of that study compared the cost of home care for cognitively impaired and cognitively intact persons over the age of 65.
Although care for older adults with cognitive impairment was less expensive in terms of actual dollars, hospital and agency readmissions were significantly greater for those who were cognitively impaired, which led to greater total costs.
Study results document that cognitively impaired older adults have special home care needs.
Results were used to develop a special psychogeriatric program within the home health agency where data were collected.
A CNS is now the key feature of this program; the CNS role in addressing the special needs of cognitively impaired home health clients is outlined.
