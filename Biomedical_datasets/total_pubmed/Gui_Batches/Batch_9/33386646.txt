To evaluate the role of Helicobacter pylori and other risk factors in recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS).
Patients with functional dyspepsia responded to questionnaires regarding demographic and clinical data, anxiety and depression, and a specific RAS questionnaire.
They underwent upper digestive endoscopy and H. pylori evaluation.
476 patients were included and of the 372 evaluated for H. pylori, 65.6% were H. pylori-positive.
RAS was reported by 32.6% (155/476).
In the bivariate analysis of the 372 patients evaluated for gastric H. pylori status, positive subjects had a lower RAS prevalence (29.9%; 73/244) than H. pylori-negative (41.4%; 53/128) (p = .026).
Smoking (p = .005) and older age (p = .034) were also associated with a lower prevalence, while female gender (p = .032) and lower income (p = .046) presented higher RAS prevalence.
In the multivariate analysis, H. pylori infection (p = .017), smoking (p = .001), and older age (p = .013) were protective factors, while lower income (p = .030) and anxiety (p = .042) were risk factors.
In the multivariate analysis of all patients, female gender, lower income, and more schooling years were risk factors.
An unexpected lower prevalence of RAS was found in H. pylori-positive patients.
Smoking, sex, age, income, education, and anxiety were associated with RAS.
