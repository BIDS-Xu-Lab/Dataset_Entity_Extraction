A visit to an emergency department can be a disorientating experience for someone with dementia.
Empowered caregivers can mitigate harm stemming from communication issues to support a successful emergency department visit.
A qualitative study determined the feasibility of the structure, format, and content of eight hospital-readiness communication tools.
Data collection involved English and French-language caregiver focus groups in two Canadian provinces.
Study findings have the potential to (a) improve safety in emergency care to older people with dementia and their caregivers, and (b) offer cost-effective communication tools for web-based knowledge translation activity in acute care.
