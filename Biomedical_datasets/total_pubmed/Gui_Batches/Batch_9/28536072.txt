The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and genetic diversity of astrovirus (AstV) detected in children hospitalized for gastroenteritis (GE).
A multi-center, hospital-based surveillance study was conducted across Lebanon to investigate the incidence of AstV among diarrheal hospitalizations.
Viral RNA was extracted from stool samples collected between 2011 and 2013 from children, below the age of 5years, hospitalized for GE at six medical centers across Lebanon.
Demographic and clinical data were collected and analyzed.
RNA of eligible samples (n=739) was screened by two AstV-specific PCR assays followed by genotype-specific PCR.
Sanger sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed for genotypic characterization.
Overall, 5.5% (41/739) of rotavirus-negative stool samples collected from hospitalized children <5years old tested positive for AstV infection.
AstV infections were detected all year long.
Diarrhea, dehydration, vomiting and fever were the most common symptoms associated with AstV infections.
Children aged 48-59months had the highest incidence of AstV. Using the Vesikari Scoring System to assess clinical severity, 85.4% of children with AstV had a score>11, indicating severe GE.
Genotype-specific PCR identified 22 classical and 4 MLB-like AstV specimens.
Further sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of orf1b and orf2 genes revealed that AstV classical 1-3, 5, 6, and 8, MLB-1, VA-1 and -2 genotypes circulated in Lebanon.
Recombination between classical AstV strains was detected in several cases as evident by the lack of congruency in the tree topologies of the orf1b and orf2.
Two cases of mixed infections between classical and non-classical genotypic strains were recorded.
High genetic diversity was detected among AstVs in Lebanon.
AstVs are associated with 5.5% of non-rotavirus GE-associated hospitalizations in children under five years in Lebanon.
