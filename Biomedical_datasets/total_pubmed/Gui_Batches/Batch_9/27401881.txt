A sample of 353 community adolescents (grades 9 to 12, 57.6Â % female) participated in a 2-wave longitudinal study of eating behaviors (overeating, loss of control eating [LOC], and binge eating) and depression.
(1) The prospective relations between eating behaviors and depressive symptoms will be reciprocal, with each predicting the other over time.
(2) These relations will be stronger for girls than for boys.
(3) These relations will be stronger for adolescents with high (not low) body mass index (BMI).
(4) LOC will show incremental predictive utility in relation to depressive symptoms over and above overeating.
Evidence supported reciprocal relations between binge eating and depressive symptoms and between overeating and depressive symptoms, but not between LOC and depressive symptoms.
Sex and BMI did not substantially moderate these relations.
Taken separately, overeating but not LOC predicted depressive symptoms.
Taken together, neither predictor was significant controlling for the other.
Results raise questions about the importance of LOC alone in predicting depressive symptoms in adolescence.
