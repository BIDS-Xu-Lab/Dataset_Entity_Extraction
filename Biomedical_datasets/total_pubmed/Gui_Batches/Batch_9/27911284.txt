The aim of our study is to examine effects of aerobic and Pilates exercises on disability, cognition, physical performance, balance, depression and fatigue in relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients as compared to healthy controls.
The subjects were divided as aerobic exercise (n = 26), Pilates (n = 9), and the healthy control group (n = 21).
We used MSFC, physical performance, Berg balance scale, Beck depression scale, fatigue impact scale.
All evaluations were performed before and after exercise training.
There are statistically meaningful differences between Nine hole testing, PASAT 3, physical performance and fatique impact scale before and after aerobic exercise.
Also we found significant difference for physical performance in the Pilates group.
There are no significant differences in measures of fatique impact scale and depression between aerobic exercise group and the healthy controls after exercise.
We found significant differences between Pilates and control group's after measurements except depression.
There were significant differences between the Pilates and aerobic group for cognitive tests in favor of the Pilates group.
Aerobic exercise and clinical Pilates exercises revealed moderate changes in levels of cognitive, physical performance, balance, depression, fatigue in MS patients.
