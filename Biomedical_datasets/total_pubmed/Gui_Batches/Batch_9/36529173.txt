As(III) is highly toxic, and its adsorption and oxidation to As(V) by minerals represent two effective approaches to remediate As(III)-contaminated sites.
Gibbsite, one of the most abundant natural minerals, shows decent adsorption for As(III), and in this study, mechanisms of As(III) immobilization and oxidation by gibbsite with different dopants (M = Fe(III), Mn(III), Mn(IV)) are addressed by periodic DFT calculations.
Influences of Fe(III) content and Mn oxidation state are also inspected.
Although a majority remain structurally similar to those of pristine gibbsite, new adsorption configurations emerge due to doping: Inner-sphere complexes with M -
As bonds for all doping, bidentate binuclear complexes for double Fe(III) doping, and physisorption with weak OMn-As interactions for Mn(IV) doping.
As(III) adsorption affinities are significantly altered by doping and rely on dopants, while inner-sphere complexes with M-OAs bonds are always lowest-energy except doping Mn(III) that prefers trigonal bipyramidal coordination and impedes As(III) chemisorption.
Doping causes strong M-3d and OAs-2p orbital interactions that facilitate As(III) adsorption whereas disappear for pristine gibbsite.
Double Fe(III)- and Mn(IV)-doped gibbsite materials are effective for As(III) oxidation to As(V), and mechanisms differ significantly although all are characterized by dual electron transfers.
Activation barriers for the most favorable reaction paths amount to 1.02 and 1.26-1.31 eV, respectively.
Physisorbed and outer-sphere As(III) complexes exhibit comparable reactivities as chemisorbed complexes that become focus of literature reports, and may also be involved during interfacial and environmental reactions.
Results rationalize experimental observations available, and provide significantly new insights that conduce to manage As-associated pollution and design efficient As(III) scavengers and oxidation catalysts.
