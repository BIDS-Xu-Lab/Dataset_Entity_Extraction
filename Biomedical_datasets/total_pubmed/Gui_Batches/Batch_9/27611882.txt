The number of patients visiting emergency departments (ED) is steadily increasing.
The cause for this rise in Germany is unclear and less examined.
This study aimed to assess the reasons of walk-in patients to visit EDs by using a direct survey.
During a period of 4 weeks, 2â€‰010 walk-in patients were anonymously surveyed in 2 major Berlin hospitals using a standardized questionnaire.
Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis.
More than 90% of patients assessed themselves as an emergency and three-quarters of patients reported pain.
The majority of patients (57%) tried to contact statutory health insurance (SHI) office-based physicians in advance and 59% of patients said they would make use of ambulatory emergency facilities if they were available and well established.
However, 55% of patients were unaware of the emergency service of the association of SHI physicians.
The results indicate that centralized ambulatory emergency facilities should be available 24/7 at hospitals with EDs.
Therefore, future planning of emergency services should integrate providers of ambulatory and inpatient sector.
International experience suggests that different instruments aiming at better coordination of care, such as integrated call centers, extended ambulatory services and facilities for less urgent cases located in or nearby hospitals with EDs should also be implemented in Germany.
