Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CAR-T) cells are currently approved for B cell malignancies only, in children and adults.
Despite a lack of robust evidence to approve such cellular immunotherapy for pediatric solid tumors, there is a growing interest for this approach in the treatment of pediatric brain tumors.
Following the identification of tumor antigens as targets, the first clinical trials demonstrated some degree of clinical and biological responses to CAR-T cells for such tumor types.
Additionaly, several preclinical studies have recently identified new attractive targets and antigen combination strategies, along with a superior tumor trafficking following locoregional administration.
We review here the preclinical and clinical knowledge at the basis of the current clinical development of CAR-T cells for pediatric brain tumors.
