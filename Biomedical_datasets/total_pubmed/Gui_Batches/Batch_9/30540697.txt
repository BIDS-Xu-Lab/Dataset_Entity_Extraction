To compare long-term hearing outcomes following ossiculoplasty with cartilage tympanoplasty with (M) and without (M) the malleus present.
One twenty-six patients (18-88 yr of age) undergoing ossiculoplasty with tympanoplasty or tympanomastoidectomy using cartilage tympanic membrane grafts from 1998 to 2012 with at least 5 years of documented postoperative follow-up.
≥5 yr after surgery), Ossiculoplasty Outcome Parameter Staging (OOPS) index, and complications.
There were 46 patients in the M group and 80 in the M group.
Preoperative PTA-ABG was 23.8 dB for M and 34.5 dB for M (p = 0.00001).
Short-term postoperative PTA-ABG was 19.3 dB for M and 18.5 dB for M (p = 0.727).
Long-term postoperative PTA-ABG was 18.2 dB for M and 19.6 dB for M (p = 0.500).
The OOPS index was 4.11 and 6.41 for M and M, respectively, (p = 0.00001).
Our data suggest that the malleus is not statistically significant with regard to its impact on final audiometric outcome following ossiculoplasty.
This has implications in our clinic, particularly in our use of the OOPS index as a prognostic tool, and will likely lead to its revision.
These data may further support the coupling theory of acoustic gain and weaken the catenary lever theory.
