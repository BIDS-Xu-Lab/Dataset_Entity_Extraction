Focal adhesion kinase (FAK; encoded by PTK2) was discovered over 30â€…years ago as a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase that is localized to cell adhesion sites, where it is activated by integrin receptor binding to extracellular matrix proteins.
FAK is ubiquitously expressed and functions as a signaling scaffold for a variety of proteins at adhesions and in the cell cytoplasm, and with transcription factors in the nucleus.
FAK expression and intrinsic activity are essential for mouse development, with molecular connections to cell motility, cell survival and gene expression.
Notably, elevated FAK tyrosine phosphorylation is common in tumors, including pancreatic and ovarian cancers, where it is associated with decreased survival.
Small molecule and orally available FAK inhibitors show on-target inhibition in tumor and stromal cells with effects on chemotherapy resistance, stromal fibrosis and tumor microenvironment immune function.
Herein, we discuss recent insights regarding mechanisms of FAK activation and signaling, its roles as a cytoplasmic and nuclear scaffold, and the tumor-intrinsic and -extrinsic effects of FAK inhibitors.
We also discuss results from ongoing and advanced clinical trials targeting FAK in low- and high-grade serous ovarian cancers, where FAK acts as a master regulator of drug resistance.
Although FAK is not known to be mutationally activated, preventing FAK activity has revealed multiple tumor vulnerabilities that support expanding clinical combinatorial targeting possibilities.
