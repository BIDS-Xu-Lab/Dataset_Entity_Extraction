The study aimed to determine the relationship between left ventricular (LV) diastolic function and the heart's spontaneous baroreflex at rest and in response to orthostatic stress during a prospective follow-up of hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy (LVH+).
LV structure and function and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) during tilt testing were evaluated in 24 LVH+ patients and compared with 25 age-matched healthy controls and 25 hypertensive patients without LVH (LVH-).
Clinical status, diastolic function and BRS were then assessed in LVH+ patients during treatment with telmisartan (monotherapy or combined with hydrochlorothiazide and/or amlodipine) at 6- and 18-month follow-ups.
LVH+ patients had significantly altered diastolic function indices and decreased BRS as compared with healthy controls and LVH- patients.
During the 18-month follow-up, favorable changes in diastolic function were associated with improvement in BRS at rest and during tilting.
In multivariate regression models, an index reflecting rate of LV myocardial relaxation (E'sept) where E'sept denotes peak early diastolic velocity at the septal mitral annulus and a surrogate for LV filling pressure (E/E'sept), independently from other clinical and echocardiographic variables related to the low-frequency component of BRS during tilting.
In conclusion, the LV diastolic function indices have independent associations with BRS parameters obtained at rest and during orthostatic stress in LVH+ patients receiving long-term pharmacological intervention.
