Leukotriene B4 release from polymorphonuclear granulocytes of severely burned patients was reduced as compared to healthy donor cells.
This decrease is due to an enhanced conversion of LTB4 into the 20-hydroxy- and 20-carboxy-metabolites and further to a decreased LTB4-synthesis.
In addition, studies on the exogenous LTB4-conversion revealed an unidentified compound which was derived from LTB4.
Our data suggest a modulation of the enzymatic activities involved in omega-oxidation of LTB4 (isoenzymes of cytochrome P-450).
