Extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas (EPSCC) are rare tumors where therapy remains poorly defined.
We sought to determine the impact of surgical extirpation and radiation therapy for outcomes of EPSCC.
The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was queried for patients with EPSCC which were further categorized by site and evaluated for survival by specific treatment strategy.
We identified 94,173 patients with small cell carcinoma of which 88,605 (94.1%) and 5,568 (5.9%) had pulmonary small cell carcinoma and EPSCC, respectively.
EPSCC patients were subdivided by site with the following proportions: genitourinary (24.1%), gastrointestinal (22.1%), head and neck (7.1%), breast (4%), and miscellaneous (42.7%).
Overall EPSSC and specifically gastrointestinal disease had significantly improved median, 5- and 10-year survival with surgery and/or radiation for all stages and sizes.
For all EPSCCs multivariate analysis revealed age (>50), gender (female), stage (regional, distant), radiation, and surgery to be independent predictors of survival.
Although outcomes for EPSCC remains poor, both surgery and radiation is shown to significantly improve median, 5- and 10-year survival rates.
EPSCC patients who are potential candidates for surgical resection or radiation therapy may benefit from these treatments.
