Of colostomised hens fed with labelled wheat protein the atom-% 15N-excess (15N') was ascertained in the bigger follicles, the restovar and the oviduct from the total N, the lysine-N, histidine-N and arginine-N.
The labelling of the basic amino acids decreases the smaller the follicles are.
In contrast to the yolk, in which a constant relation between the three amino acids was found, the relations were inconsistent and typical of the individual hens.
In the atom-% 15N' in the three amino acids in the restovar and the oviduct there were greater differences between the hens.
In the lysine, histidine and arginine we found, on an average, 21.2% of the total labelled N of the follicles.
