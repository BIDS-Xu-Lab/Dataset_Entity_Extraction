The aim of this prospective study was to identify alcoholic liver disease or covert alcohol abuse in unselected consecutive patients referred to a gastroenterologic out-patient's clinic for elevated liver enzymes.
One-hundred-and-thirteen patients were questioned about alcohol consumption, trauma history and loss of driver's licence.
Laboratory tests claimed to reflect alcohol consumption and liver biopsy were taken.
Twenty-six patients openly admitted alcohol abuse (> 300 g week-1) and 85% of these had alcoholic liver damage.
The index identified a further 12 patients as abusers who stated an intermediate alcohol consumption (25-300 g week-1).
Half of these had alcoholic liver damage.
Thus, a total of 34% of the patients were identified as abusers and in one-third of these the abuse was covert.
