Cardiac hypertrophy (CH) is one of the stages in the occurrence and development of severe cardiovascular diseases, and exploring its biomarkers is beneficial for delaying the progression of severe cardiovascular diseases.
In this research, we established a comprehensive and highly efficient pseudotargeted metabolomics method, which demonstrated a superior capacity to identify differential metabolites when compared to traditionaluntargeted metabolomics.
The intra/inter-day precision and reproducibility results proved the method is reliable and precise.
The established method was then applied to seek the potential differentiated metabolic biomarkers of cardiac hypertrophy (CH) rats, and oxylipins, phosphorylcholine (PC), lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LysoPE), Krebs cycle intermediates, carnitines, amino acids, and bile acids were disclosed to be the possible differentiate components.
Their metabolic pathway analysis revealed that the potential metabolic alterations in CH rats were mainly associated with phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, citrate cycle, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, and tyrosine metabolism.
In sum, this research provided a comprehensiveand reliable LC-MS/MS MRM platform for pseudo-targeted metabolomics investigation of disease condition, and some interesting potential biomarkers were disclosed for CH, which merit further exploration in the future.
