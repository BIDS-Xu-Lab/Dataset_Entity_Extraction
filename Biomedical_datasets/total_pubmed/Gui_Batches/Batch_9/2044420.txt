An alcohol withdrawal syndrome affects the patient in a 'vulnerable phase' either after an operation or posttraumatically.
It can be shown pathophysiologically, that the symptoms are caused by a hyperactivity of the central sympathetic nervous system and a disbalance of the neurotransmitters.
As for these complex symptoms, a multi-layered treatment is required.
We report on our experiences with 23 patients who were treated in our intensive care unit.
The treatment included a benzo-diazepine and a drug effecting central alpha 2-receptors.
Only three of these patients had to be intubated or ventilated.
Because of the induced bradycardia monitor observation was required in all cases.
The patients could be wakened up at any time and thus were co-operative for basic care.
One patient died of pulmonary embolism, a second patient died of cardiovascular failure as a consequence of cardiac insufficiency.
