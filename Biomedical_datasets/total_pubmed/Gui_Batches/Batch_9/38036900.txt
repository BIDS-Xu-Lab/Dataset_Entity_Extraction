The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is an essential regulatory system for maintaining homeostasis, and its dysfunction may cause various diseases.
The activity of proteasome and ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes has been found to be greatly increased in breast cancer (BC), indicating that the heterogeneity of UPS may be related to the progression of BC.
Gene data was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases and performed in multiple algorithms to construct a UPS-related signature for BC.
Patients in the UPS low-risk group had greater overall and recurrence-free survival probability than those in the UPS high-risk group.
This signature was closely associated with functional enrichment.
Some high metabolism-related pathways were more active in the UPS high-risk group.
The UPS low-risk group had more abundant anti-tumor immune cells, while in the UPS high-risk group, immunosuppressive cells were dominant.
More importantly, we found that the UPS low-risk group was more sensitive to immunotherapy, while the UPS high-risk group responded better to radiotherapy.
Drug sensitivity analysis identified more effective chemotherapy drugs in different UPS-related risk groups.
This UPS-related signature may serve as a novel biomarker and independent prognostic factor for BC.
It can effectively predict prognosis, immune infiltration, and therapy efficacy, providing new strategies for individualized treatment.
