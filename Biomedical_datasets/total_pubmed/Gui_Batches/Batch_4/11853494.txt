Six strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) varieties, Senga Sengana, Jonsok, Polka, Korona, Bounty, and Honeoye, were studied in relation to composition of their volatile headspace compounds collected by dynamic purge-and-trap concentration.
Also, the influence of cultivation technique on the volatile compounds was tested by comparing conventionally and organically cultivated strawberry varieties.
In addition, the effect of geographical origin on strawberry volatiles was investigated.
The emphasis of this study was lay in the industrial utilization of strawberry.
A total of 52 different volatile compounds were determined from frozen strawberries grown in 1997 and 1998.
In addition to individual compounds, total areas of chromatogram profiles were compared.
The major esters were found to be methyl butanoate, ethyl butanoate, methyl hexanoate, and ethyl hexanoate.
With the application of principal component analysis and analysis of variance to the data matrix, the varieties were classified into three groups.
Honeoye was most different from the others.
Organic cultivation had no effect on strawberry volatiles.
