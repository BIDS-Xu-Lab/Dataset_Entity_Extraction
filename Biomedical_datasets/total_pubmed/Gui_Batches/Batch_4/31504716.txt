This study aimed to assess the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) and its correlates, amongst currently married Saudi women.
A total of 400 currently married females aged 19-65 years old who attended the outpatient clinics of PHC centres in Riyadh, from 1 November 2015 to 1 February 2016, were screened for the current and previous experiences with IPV, and its correlates, using the previously validated Arabic version of the WHO multi-country instrument on violence against women.
Logistic regression analyses were applied to identify the correlates of IPV.
The lifetime overall prevalence of IPV was 44.8%, in the form of; physical (18.5%), emotional (25.5%), sexual (19.2%) and economic (25.3%) violence.
[OR = 2.76, P < 0.001], whilst husband's experience was significantly associated with only the emotional violence [OR = 2.4, P = 0.004].
Physical violence was significantly more prevalent when the woman lived with other wife in same house.
IPV with its all forms was prevalent amongst Saudi women.
Child abuse experience and polygamy were significantly associated with IPV.
Designing tailored IPV national prevention programmes is a necessity.
