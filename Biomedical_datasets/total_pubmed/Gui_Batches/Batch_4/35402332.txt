The growing prevalence of obesity in the USA has resulted in increased consumption of weight loss products that promote fat metabolism.
Dietary supplements used for weight loss contain a wide variety of ingredients but the amount of scientific information available on these ingredients varies considerably.
Such supplements have documented and undocumented adverse effects.
Although the FDA frequently issues health advisories, the health consequences of consuming supplements are often overlooked by the general public.
A common supplement used for weight loss is Hydroxycut.
The ingredients used in the different forms of Hydroxycut products vary but generally include caffeine and green tea extract, which are responsible for a wide range of adverse effects.
We present the case of 41-year-old man with a medical history of polysubstance abuse who developed acute compartment syndrome in the setting of rhabdomyolysis from prolonged immobilisation and the use of Hydroxycut.
This case demonstrates the possible adverse effects of consuming weight loss herbal supplements like Hydroxycut.
Healthcare professionals and consumers are encouraged to report serious adverse events or product quality problems with the use of these supplements to the FDA's MedWatch adverse event reporting program.
The weight loss supplement Hydroxycut is sold in various formulations whose side effect profiles are not fully known; the latest formulation has a very high concentration of caffeine which increases the risk of rhabdomyolysis.
Although uncommon, exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis can cause compartment syndrome, especially in the setting of concurrent use of weight loss supplements.
High clinical suspicion, prompt diagnosis and early treatment are key to preventing complications from compartment syndrome.
