Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has a physical, psychological and social impact, often compromising the patient's ability to perform daily activities.
Recently a new measurement for disability in IBD was developed.
The Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Disability Score (IBD-DS) comprises the following domains: mobility, self-care, major daily life activities, gastrointestinal-related problems, mental health and interaction with the environment.
The aim of our study was to translate to Portuguese and to validate the IBD-DS.
Eighty-five patients, 55 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 30 with ulcerative colitis (UC), completed the Portuguese version of the IBD-DS and the short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (SIBDQ-10 questions).
Disease activity was assessed using the Harvey-Bradshaw (HB) for CD and partial Mayo score (pMayo) for UC.
Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation between the IBD-DS and SIBDQ.
The Student's t-test was used to compare the mean of IBD-DS between active and inactive disease.
Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 21.0 and the statistical level of significance (α) was established at 5%.
In our study, a significant negative correlation between the IBD-DS and the SIBDQ was observed (r = -0.858, p < 0.001 for CD and r = -0.933, p < 0.001 for UC).
There was a statistically significant difference of the mean of IBD-DS between inactive vs. active disease (93.78 vs. 117.57, p = 0.016 for CD and 78.96 vs. 137.14, p < 0.001 for UC).
The Portuguese version of the inflammatory bowel disease-disability score has a strong correlation with patients' quality of life and clinical disease activity and was shown to be a valid tool to measure disability in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
