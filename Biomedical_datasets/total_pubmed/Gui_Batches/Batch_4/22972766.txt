Salvia lachnostachys Benth., Lamiaceae, is a endemic species from southern Brazil.
The essential oil of its leaves and flowers is mainly constituted by aliphatic compounds, such as dodecanoic acid, with sesquiterpenes as minor constituents.
This work evaluated the morphology, anatomy, microchemistry, and phytochemistry of S. lachnostachys to provide advanced knowledge of Brazilian plants with medicinal potential.
Light and scanning electron microscopy techniques were used in the anatomical and microchemical studies.
Compounds were isolated by chromatographic techniques, identified by analysis of their NMR spectra and compared with published data.
S. lachnostachys can be distinguished from other related species mainly by its petiolate leaves, terminal inflorescence, persistent bracts, and villous-glandular corolla.
The stem and leaves of S. lachnostachys display anatomical characteristics common to the family Lamiaceae.
However, this species can be distinguished from other family members by the morphology and the presence of eglandular and glandular trichomes, as well as the organization of the vascular bundles of the petiole.
The phytochemical results revealed that S. lacnostachys produces oleanolic and ursolic acids in addition to the diterpene fruticuline A, which is a rare compound, previously found only in Salvia fruticulosa Benth.
Ursolic and oleanolic acids are bioactive triterpenes that exhibit antiatherosclerotic, anticancer, antihypertensive, antinflammatory, antileukemic, antimutagenic, antioxidant, antiproliferative, and antiviral activities, and fruticuline A has antibacterial activity.
