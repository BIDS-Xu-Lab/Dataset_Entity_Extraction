The objective of this study was to describe the development, utilization and utility of an ongoing evaluation of a system of coordinated services to persons living in two naturally occurring retirement communities (NORCs).
The evaluation system includes service provision, service utilization and client satisfaction.
It identifies trends in provided services and determines how services are utilized.
A continuous monitoring system for reporting and quality improvement was developed with the four service agencies associated with the service provision system.
The monthly data from each agency are compiled and distributed in the form of a report.
The evaluation project was successful in tailoring the reporting system to each agency.
Multiple issues arose with staff compliance in utilization of the system, but, overall, the system evaluation presents detailed feedback on the services provided and helps with continuing development, testing of new delivery models, planning, maximizing resource utilization, customer service, and attaining and sustaining funding.
A system evaluation of an organization that provides services to a community is vital to optimizing frequency and quality of services.
There are many ways to implement system evaluations.
However, the use of electronic-based records increases the likelihood of maintaining and utilizing the system.
