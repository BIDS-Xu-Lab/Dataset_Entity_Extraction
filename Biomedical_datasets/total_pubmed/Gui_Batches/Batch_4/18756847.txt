The Down syndrome (further on as DS) is one of the most studied autosomal chromosomal aberrations.
Since its first identification (1866) there have continuous efforts been made to better understand this genetic fault and to improve its diagnosis; to investigate the manifested phenotype; to uncover the enzymatic changes, and the altered albumin metabolism; to analyze the gene-structure and to do the most for its prevention.
According to the database of National Registry of Hereditary Diseases (NRHD) the incidence of the illness is continuously growing.
The average 1.04 per thousand value of the 1970s has grown by 0.60 point by the year 1999.
The case is worsened by the fact that in Hungary 60% of DS patients are born from mothers under the age of 35.
These are also confirmed by other international data.
Moreover American data also showed that 80% of the DS patients were born from mothers under the age of 35.
Today the average age of child-bearing mothers is 32.5 which is getting closer to the critical 35 years of age, after which the incidence of DS is significantly higher.
Concerning all of these the present review paper makes an attempt to summarize the latest facts and evidences found in the literature and also tries to give a detailed list of clinical features that are important from the stomatological as well as from the periodontal point of view.
