A solution for peritoneal dialysis stored in bags made from material which does not contain diethylhexyl phthalate is significantly less contaminated with this plasticizer, as compared with a solution stored in bags made from PVC with diethylhexyl phthalate.
The afferent tube which contains diethylhexyl phthalate in all sets investigated by the authors is not an important source of this plasticizer for the peritoneal solution.
Contamination of the peritoneal solution with dibutyl phthalate added to colours used for print on the bags (inscription on the outside of the bag) was found in both types of bags (no significant differences were found).
It may be thus assumed that dibutyl phthalate penetrates through the wall of both types of bags with the same intensity.
This applies only, provided that the peritoneal solution is not contaminated with dibutyl phthatate during preparation, before it is filled into bags.
After six hours instillation in the peritoneal cavity diethylhexyl phthalate and dibutyl phthalate was not detectable in the peritoneal solution (detection limit 0.5 microgram/l).
They are completely retained and metabolized resp.
