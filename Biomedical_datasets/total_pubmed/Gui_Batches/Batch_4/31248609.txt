To determine the epidemiology and clinical pattern of Congolese patients with ocular toxoplasmosis.
A retrospective study was conducted on records of patients with ocular toxoplasmosis examined in the Teaching Hospital of Kinshasa (DR Congo) from 2010 to 2012.
Each patient underwent a complete ophthalmic examination.
Sociodemographic data, clinical symptoms and signs, visual outcome, modality of treatment and type of complications were studied.
Thirty-five cases of ocular toxoplasmosis were diagnosed out of 18,144 patients, giving a frequency of 0.2 %.
Eighteen men (51.4 %) were affected, with a sex ratio of 1.05.
The mean age of the patients was 40.9±20 years (range: 10-72 years).
The mean time until consultation was 10 months (range: 2 days-84 months).
Ocular involvement was unilateral for 65.7 % of patients.
Decreased visual acuity (77.1 %) and pain (7.1 %) were the main ocular complains.
Chorioretinal lesions involved the central retina in 26 patients (74.3 %).
Five patients (14.2 %) developed recurrences during follow-up.
Complications affected 17 patients (48.6 %), with macular scarring (34.3 %) and cataract (17.1 %) being the most common.
At the first consultation, 61.7 % of the affected eyes had visual impairment (VA<0.3).
and they lead to visual impairment in the majority of patients.
