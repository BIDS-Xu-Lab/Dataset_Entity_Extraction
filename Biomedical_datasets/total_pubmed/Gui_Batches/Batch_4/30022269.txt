To assess the viability of multispecies microcosm biofilm after contact with NeoMTA Plus, Biodentine, and MTA Angelus.
Fifty-four human dentin blocks (4 × 5 × 4 mm) were allocated to Hawley retainers, worn by six volunteers for 72 h. The blocks were then individually incubated in BHI broth for 21 days at 37 °C.
At the end of experimental time for biofilm growth, the samples were randomly divided into four groups (n = 12): NeoMTA Plus, Biodentine, MTA Angelus, and negative control.
The materials were placed in contact with the blocks.
All samples were placed in cell-culture plate wells and incubated in BHI broth for 7 days at 37 °C.
One sample from each volunteer (n = 6) was analyzed by SEM to describe the biofilm morphology.
CLSM was performed to determine the percentage of viable biofilm biovolume.
The data were statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison test (α = 5%).
SEM showed biofilm formed by spherical and rod-shaped bacteria surrounded by an extracellular matrix.
No material was able to kill all biofilm cells, and all groups had more than 50% of viable bacteria.
NeoMTA Plus was significantly different from the negative control group (P < .05).
All tested materials were not effective against multispecies microcosm biofilm.
NeoMTA Plus, Biodentine, and MTA Angelus were not effective against multispecies microcosm biofilm.
It is essential to understand that these bioceramic cements are indicated for infected clinical situations.
Thus, complementary disinfection procedures should be conducted prior to filling with these materials.
