Major depression is a syndrome that can be triggered by numerous physical and psychosocial factors.
Concurrent somatic complaints can complicate the diagnosis.
Patient evaluation requires a comprehensive history, physical and mental status examinations, and a number of laboratory studies.
Effective treatment of depression enhances the quality of life, reduces the probability of secondary alcoholism or suicide, frequently improves coexisting medical problems and reduces the high rate of health care use by these patients.
