To determine the tolerability, persistenceand satisfaction of patients with overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) treated with transdermal oxybutynin (OXY-TDS).
Observational, retrospective, multicenter study, in patients with OAB who had started treatment with OXY-TDS at least 12 months before their inclusion.
Tolerability was evaluated by number, severity criteria, resolution type of adverse reactions, and cognitive function with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), at 1 year of treatment.
The patients who remained under treatment during the observation period were considered persistent.
Patient satisfaction was evaluated using an ad hoc questionnaire.
The clinical history of 105 patients was evaluated.
The mean age of all the patients was 59.4 Â± 11.8 years.
After 12 months of treatment, dry mouth was present in 5.7% of patients and 27.6% had mild or moderate adverse reactions in the area of application.
The persistence in treatment was 55.2%.
The use of the OXY-TDS was considered comfortable or very comfortable by 92.9% of patients.
The study performed in patients with OAB shows that OXY-TDS provides low incidence of systemic adverse effects, including dry mouth, high persistence, improved adherence rates and high satisfaction of patients after one year of treatment.
