Indian hedgehog (Ihh) is essential for embryonic mandibular condylar growth and disc primordium formation.
To determine whether it regulates those processes during post-natal life, we ablated Ihh in cartilage of neonatal mice and assessed the consequences on temporomandibular joint (TMJ) growth and organization over age.
Ihh deficiency caused condylar disorganization and growth retardation and reduced polymorphic cell layer proliferation.
Expression of Sox9, Runx2, and Osterix was low, as was that of collagen II, collagen I, and aggrecan, thus altering the fibrocartilaginous nature of the condyle.
Though a disc formed, it exhibited morphological defects, partial fusion with the glenoid bone surface, reduced synovial cavity space, and, unexpectedly, higher lubricin expression.
Analysis of the data shows, for the first time, that continuous Ihh action is required for completion of post-natal TMJ growth and organization.
Lubricin overexpression in mutants may represent a compensatory response to sustain TMJ movement and function.
