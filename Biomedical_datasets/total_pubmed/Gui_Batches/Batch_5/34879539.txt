The current demand for alternative water sources requires the incorporation of low-cost composites in remediation technologies.
These represent a sustainable alternative to more expensive, commercially used adsorbents.
The main objective of this comprehensive field-scale study was to incorporate the layered double hydroxides (LDHs) into the hybrid biochar-based composites and apply an innovative material to remediate As/Sb-rich mine waters.
The presence of hydrous Fe oxides (HFOs) within the composite enhanced the total adsorption efficiency of the composite for As(V) and Sb(V).
The kinetic data fitted a pseudo-second order model.
Equilibrium experiments confirmed that the composite had a stronger interaction with As(V) than with Sb(V).
The efficient removal of As(V) from mine water was achieved in both batch and continuous flow column systems, reaching up to 98% and 80%, respectively.
Sb(V) showed different behavior to As(V) during mine water treatment, reaching adsorption efficiencies of up to 39% and 26% in batch and column experiments, respectively.
The migration of Sb(V) in mine water was mostly attributed to its dispersion before it was able to show affinity to the composite.
In general, the proposed column technology is suitable for the field remediation of small volumes of contaminated water, and thus has significant commercial potential.
