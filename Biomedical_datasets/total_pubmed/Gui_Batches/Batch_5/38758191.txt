The use of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF) is based on the results of robust clinical trials.
To assess the effectiveness and safety of BIC/FTC/TAF in treatment-naïve (TN) and treatment-experienced (TE) people with HIV using available real-world cohort studies.
Systematic review and meta-analysis of publications and communications identified via Boolean search in Medline, PubMed and Embase, and conference abstracts reporting retrospective real-world use of BIC/FTC/TAF, published until 31 January 2024.
The primary endpoint was the proportion of TN and TE people with HIV with viral load (VL) < 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks while on treatment.
Of the 38 identified publications and conference abstracts, for the present analysis we included 12 publications (comprising 792 TN and 6732 TE individuals).
For the three publications including 507 TN participants reporting the primary outcome, VL suppression was 97%
For the nine publications including 4946 TE participants reporting the primary outcome, VL suppression was 95% (95% CI: 94-96), with suppression >93% in all studies.
Total discontinuations at 48 weeks in TE individuals were 3% (95% CI: 2-5), 1% (95% CI: 0-2) due to side effects.
A total of four publications with 151 TE individuals with previous presence of M184V substitution were identified, reporting a suppression rate at 48 weeks of 95% (95% CI: 88-100).
Real-world studies demonstrate low discontinuation rates and high rates of virologic suppression in individuals treated with BIC/FTC/TAF, both TN and TE with and without previous detection of M184V substitution.
