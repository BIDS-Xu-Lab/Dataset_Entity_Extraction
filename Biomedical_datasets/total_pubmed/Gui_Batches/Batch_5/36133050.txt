Two dimensional (2D) carbonaceous materials such as graphene and its derivatives, e.g., graphdiyne, have enormous potential possibilities in major fields of scientific research.
Theoretically, it has been proposed that the perfect atomic lattice arrangement of these materials is responsible for their outstanding physical and chemical properties, and also for their poor magnetic properties.
Experimentally, it is difficult to obtain a perfect atomic lattice of carbon atoms due to the appearance of structural disorder.
This structural disorder is generated during the growth or synthesis of carbon-related materials.
Investigations of structural disorder reveal that it can offer both advantages and disadvantages depending on the application.
For instance, disorder reduces the thermal and mechanical stability, and deteriorates the performance of 2D carbon-based electronic devices.
The most interesting effect of structural disorder can be seen in the field of magnetism.
Disorder not only creates magnetic ordering within 2D carbon materials but also influences the local electronic structure, which opens the door for future spintronic devices.
Although various studies on the disorder induced magnetism of 2D carbon materials are available in the literature, some parts of the above field have still not been fully exploited.
This review presents existing work for the future development of 2D carbon-based devices.
