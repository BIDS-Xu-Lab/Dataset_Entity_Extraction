To describe the indications, technique and outcomes of the novel surgical procedure of duodenum and ventral pancreas preserving subtotal pancreatectomy (DVPPSP).
Data collected retrospectively from 43 patients who underwent DVPPSP and TP between 2009 and 2015 in our single centre were analysed.
For enrolment, only patients with low-grade pancreatic neoplasms, such as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), and solid pseudo-papillary tumors, were included.
Ten DVPPSP (group 1) and 13 TP (group 2) patients were selected in this study.
There were no significant differences in age, gender, comorbidities, preoperative symptoms, American Society of Anesthesiologists score or indications for surgery between the two groups.
The most common indication was IPMN for DVPPSP and TP (60% vs 85%, P = 0.411).
Compared with the TP group, the DVPPSP group had comparable postoperative morbidities (P = 0.405) and mortalities (both nil), but significantly shorter operative time (232 ± 19.6 min vs 335 ± 32.3 min, P < 0.001).
DVPPSP preserved better long-term pancreatic function with less supplementary therapy (P < 0.001) and better quality of life (QoL) after surgery, including better scores in social (P = 0.042) and global health (P = 0.047) on functional scales and less appetite loss (P = 0.049) on the symptom scale.
DVPPSP is a feasible and safe procedure that could be an alternative to TP for low-grade neoplasms arising from the body and tail region but across the neck region of the pancreas; DVPPSP had better metabolic function and QoL after surgery.
