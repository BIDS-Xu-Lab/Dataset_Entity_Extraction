Zinc, cadmium, and copper are known to interact in many transport processes, but the mechanism of inhibition is widely debated, being either competitive or noncompetitive according to the experimental model employed.
We investigated the mechanisms of inhibition of zinc transport by cadmium and copper using renal proximal cells isolated from rabbit kidney.
Initial rates of 65Zn uptake were assessed after 0.5 min of incubation.
The kinetics parameters of zinc uptake obtained at 20 degrees C were a Jmax of 208.0 +/- 8.4 pmol.min-1.(mg protein)-1, a Km of 15.0 +/- 1.5 microM and an unsaturable constant of 0.259 +/- 0.104 (n = 8).
Cadmium at 15 microM competitively inhibited zinc uptake.
In the presence of 50 microM cadmium, or copper at both 15 and 50 microM, there was evidence of noncompetitive inhibition.
These data suggest that zinc and cadmium enter renal proximal cells via a common, saturable, carrier-mediated process.
The mechanisms of the noncompetitive inhibition observed at higher concentrations of cadmium or with copper require further investigation, but may involve a toxic effect on the cytoskeleton.
