To examine the long-term effects of parental divorce on interpersonal problems and to identify specific childhood pre- and postdivorce experiences that might be associated with these problems.
Scores on the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems in a university student population were compared for 125 subjects from divorced families, subgrouped by specific divorce experiences, and 467 subjects from intact families.
Young adult children of divorce reported more problems with submission and overcontrol.
When specific divorce experiences were examined, problems with intimacy emerged in the children of divorce.
Mother never remarrying, multiple maternal remarriage, and high levels of pre- and postseparation parental discord were associated with more interpersonal problems.
These data support the hypothesis that parental divorce is associated with interpersonal problems in young adulthood.
The findings also provide evidence that specific childhood pre- and postdivorce experiences are associated with later young adult interpersonal problems, including problems with intimacy.
