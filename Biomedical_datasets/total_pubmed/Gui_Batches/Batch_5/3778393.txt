The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised and the Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Test Battery were administered to 15 Army aviators and 15 non-aviators, matched for age and education, to identify functional differences between these populations and to begin to establish norms for unimpaired Army aviators.
Results were generally nondiscriminatory although Army aviators performed in the high average range on a number of variables.
No clinical inferences were drawn from this limited data but utilization of the tests for obtaining normative group and individual baseline data, as well as assisting flight surgeons in assessing intellectual abilities of aviators, appears to have some merit.
