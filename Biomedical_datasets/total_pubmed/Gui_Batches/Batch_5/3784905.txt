Hypokinesis is known to exert a negative effect on human systems, the circulatory, osseo-articular, muscular and many other systems.
Ergonomic investigations, performed during five years and covering 1350 women employed at clothing and knitting plants as seamstresses carrying out their work at piece-rate, direct line as well as beltsystem, under the conditions of restricted motorial activity, i.e. under hypokinetic conditions, revealed the occurrence of pelviccongestion syndrome (pcs).
Relying on the obtained results of the investigations, the evaluation involved the condition of women's reproductive organ in the context of the integrated state of health of female workers employed as seamstresses at clothing and knitting plants, viewed against the background of professional and sociological problems.
Moreover, recommendations were issued as to the treatment of genital organ disorders in women employed under the conditions of restricted motorial activity, and also prophylaxis concerning these disturbances, particularly with regard, to the pelvic congestion syndrome.
Elements of reorganization of the health service at the clothing and knitting industry plants have been worked out and described.
