Key advances in our understanding of immunobiology and the immunosuppressive mechanisms of the tumour microenvironment have led to significant breakthroughs in manipulating the immune system to successfully treat cancer.
Remarkable therapeutic responses have occurred with tumours that carry a high mutational burden.
In these cases, pre-existing tumour-specific T cells can be rejuvenated via checkpoint inhibition to eliminate tumours.
Furthermore, durable remissions have been achieved in haematological malignancies following adoptive transfer of T cells that specifically target cell surface proteins where expression is restricted to the malignancy's cell of origin.
Soft tissue sarcomas and bone sarcomas have a paucity of non-synonymous somatic mutations and do not commonly express known, targetable, tumour-specific antigens.
Historically, soft tissue sarcomas have been considered immunologically 'cold' and as such, unlikely candidates for immune therapy.
Here, we review the immune landscape of canine and feline sarcomas and the immunotherapeutic strategies that have been employed in veterinary clinical trials to improve patient outcome.
We also provide insight into immunotherapeutic approaches being used to treat human sarcomas.
Together, current data indicates that, rather than a barren immunological wasteland, sarcomas represent a field of opportunities for immunotherapies.
Furthermore, we and others would suggest that strategic combinations of immunotherapeutic approaches may hold promise for more effective treatments for high grade soft tissue sarcomas and bone sarcomas.
