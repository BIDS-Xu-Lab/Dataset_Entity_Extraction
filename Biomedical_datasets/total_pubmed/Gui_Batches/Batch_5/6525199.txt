The efflux of Ca2+ induced by alloxan in isolated mouse liver mitochondria was potentiated by atractylate, and by depletion of the organelles in adenine nucleotides, whereas bongkrekate, and added ATP or ADP, but not AMP, inhibited the alloxan effect.
The data suggest that the Ca2+ releasing action of alloxan is dependent on the intramitochondrial pool of adenine nucleotides.
