The purpose of this study was to test a model of sexual self-concept and sexual risk cognition affecting sexual communication in Taiwanese adolescents.
Parent-adolescent sexual communication has been shown to influence adolescent sexual behaviour.
Self-concept is an important predictor of human behaviour, especially sexual behaviour.
Few researchers have assessed sexual self-concept in adolescents, despite its clear relevance to understanding adolescent sexual behaviour.
A cross-sectional survey with convenience sampling was used in this study.
In 2009, data were collected by questionnaire from 748 adolescent students at a junior college in Taiwan.
The results revealed that the postulated model fits the data from this study well.
Sexual self-concept significantly predicts sexual risk cognition and sexual communication.
Sexual risk cognition significantly predicts sexual communication and has an intervening effect on the relationship between sexual self-concept and sexual communication.
Sexual risk cognition is important in explaining sexuality in adolescents.
Sexual self-concept has both direct and indirect effects on sexual communication.
Our findings provide concrete directions for school educators in developing sexual health programmes to increase adolescent sexual self-concept and sexual communication with their parents.
Future sexual health programmes about sexual self-concept and sexual risk cognition must add for increasing adolescent's sexual communication with their parents.
