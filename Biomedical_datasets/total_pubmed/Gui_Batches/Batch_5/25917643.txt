Endogenous factors such as stress-induced immune system reactivity were also associated with dyshidrosis.
Herpes zoster (HZ) incidence has been demonstrated to increase with immune deficiencies.
Therefore, a relationship between dyshidrosis and HZ may exist.
This study investigated whether there is an association between dyshidrosis and HZ.
We conducted a population-based cohort study by using Taiwan's Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (LHID2000) records from 1996 to 2011.
The dyshidrosis group comprised 8488 patients with newly identified dyshidrosis and no history of HZ prior to diagnosis of dyshidrosis.
For the non-dyshidrosis group, each dyshidrosis patient frequency matched according to age (5-year intervals), sex and index date year with four controls selected randomly from the LHID2000.
After adjustments for confounding risk factors, the hazard ratio for HZ in the dyshidrosis group was 1.31 compared with the non-dyshidrosis group.
Regardless of comorbidities, patients with dyshidrosis had a higher risk of HZ than did controls without dyshidrosis.
Patients with more hospital visits that were due to dyshidrosis had a higher risk of HZ.
Dyshidrosis is strongly associated with HZ.
Patients treated for dyshidrosis should be warned of HZ risk.
