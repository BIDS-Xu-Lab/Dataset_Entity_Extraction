The COVID-19 disease primarily affects the respiratory system; however, cardiac involvement has been documented in the acute phase.
We aimed to evaluate the cardiac autonomic function and subtle left ventricular dysfunction in those subjects recovered from mild to moderate acute COVID-19 patients but still symptomatic.
The study group was composed of 50 subjects with confirmed mild to moderate COVID-19.
All subjects underwent routine 2D echocardiography assessment in addition to 2D speckle tracking and 24 h Holter monitoring for HRV analysis.
The mean age of the study population was 42 ± 18 years; symptoms were reported as follows 27 (54%) had dyspnoea, 17 (34%) had palpitation, and 7 (14%) had dizziness.
Time domain parameters Standard Deviation of NN intervals (SDNN), Standard Deviation of the Average NN intervals for each 5 min segment of a 24 h HRV recording (SDANN), and Root Mean Square of Successive RR interval Differences (rMSSD) were diminished with mean SDNN value being markedly impaired in 12 (24%) patients, while frequency domain parameters as assessed by the ratio of the Low-Frequency band power to the High-Frequency band power (LF/HF) with the mean of 1.837 with 8% of the patients being impaired.
SDNN was significantly reduced in patients with impaired global longitudinal strain (p 0.000).
The global longitudinal strain was diminished in 10 patients (20%); also, 80% of the patients with impaired GLS had decreased SDNN.
Our study targeted patients experiencing prolonged symptoms after COVID-19 illness.
We detected a high incidence of GLS impairment using Speckle Tracking Echocardiography (STE) and a significant prevalence of diminished HRV.
HRV (especially SDNN) and GLS were found to be significantly correlated.
