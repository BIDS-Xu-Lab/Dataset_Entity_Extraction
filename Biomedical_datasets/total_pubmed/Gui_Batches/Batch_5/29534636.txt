Objectives: The purpose of this review is to explore the effects of chocolate consumption during pregnancy on fetus and mother herself.
Methods: Randomized controlled trials/quasi-experimental/observational/controlled before and after studies involving chocolate/cocoa/cacao consumption (irrespective of type or dose, composition, exposure period, and method of administration) among pregnant women/animals; and measuring any outcome (beneficial or harmful) related to fetus or mother after chocolate exposure were included.
Databases searched were PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus; between April and May 2017.
Risk of bias within each human randomized controlled trial (RCT) and animals' experimental studies was evaluated by "The Cochrane Collaboration's tool" and SYRCLE's tool respectively.
Fourteen human studies including a total of 6639 participants and nine animal studies were selected.
Outcome variables investigated in human studies were maternal blood pressure, fetal heart rate, and striae gravidarum.
Animal studies explored chocolate-induced teratogenicity and fetal metabolic derangements.
Ten out of these 23 studies reported chocolate to be "beneficial"; five studies reported adverse effects, whereas eight studies declared chocolate as "neutral".
Conclusions: Maternal chocolate intake has acute stimulatory effects on fetal reactivity and chronic blood pressure reducing effect in mothers.
Chocolate is nonteratogenic and does not affect reproductive indices.
Metabolic derangements in offsprings born to chocolate fed dams have been reported.
Pregnant females must be careful about consumption of cocoa and chocolate.
Future studies should be planned, keeping in view heterogeneities identified across the selected studies in this review.
