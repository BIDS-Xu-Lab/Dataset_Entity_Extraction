Peculiarities of interaction between the polynuclear leucocyte (PNL) system and bacterial agents are considered within the framework of four typical clinico-biological situations: interaction of a primarily genetically deficient PNL system with a bacterial agent; interaction of a secondarily affected by various diseases and traumas PNL system with a bacterial agent; interaction of an unaltered PNL system with a bacterial agent of an extreme intensity; interaction of an unaltered PNL system with an ordinary bacterial agent.
In the first three situations characterized by a purulent inflammatory-infectious process, current methods of investigation detect some disturbances of PNL function reflecting their functional insufficiency.
In the fourth situation the functional sufficiency (but not inactivity) of the PNL system determines the state of clinical health.
Obviously, regardless of the functional insufficiency, whether absolute or relative, it results in an inflammatory-infectious process.
