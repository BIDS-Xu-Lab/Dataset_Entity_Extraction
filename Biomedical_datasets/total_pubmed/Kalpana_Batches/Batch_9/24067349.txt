The percentile distribution of blood pressure (BP) with regard to age, sex and cardiovascular risk factors is unknown.
We aimed to provide epidemiological data for a comprehensive description of the BP distribution across a wide age-range.
We used data from the German Metabolic and Cardiovascular Risk Project (GEMCAS), a cross-sectional study with 35 683 participants aged 18-99 years, conducted during October 2005 in 1511 randomly selected general practices in Germany.
BP and waist circumference were measured, data on lifestyle, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and medication assessed.
In men, we found even in the lowest percentile (5th) a gradual increase of the systolic BP from the lowest to the highest age group of 10 mm Hg, all other percentile groups an increase of 20 mm Hg.
In women, this increase ranged from 15 mm Hg (5th percentile) to 40 mm Hg (95th percentile).
In a subgroup of participants with no antihypertensive usage (n=22 550) and no CVD/CVD risk factors (n=13 297), we still observed a distinct age-related increase of BP readings.
Our study provides detailed information on the population distribution of BP readings in both sexes and also among very old individuals.
The results are useful in a public health context to plan gender-
