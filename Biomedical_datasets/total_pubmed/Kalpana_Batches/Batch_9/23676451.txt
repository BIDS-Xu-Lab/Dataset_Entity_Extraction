An accurate physical fitness survey could be useful in research and clinical care.
To estimate the validity and reliability of a Self-Reported Fitness (SRFit) survey; an instrument that estimates muscular fitness, flexibility, cardiovascular endurance, BMI, and body composition (BC) in adults â‰¥ 40 years of age.
201 participants completed the SF-36 Physical Function Subscale, International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), Older Adults' Desire for Physical Competence Scale (Rejeski), the SRFit survey, and the Rikli and Jones Senior Fitness Test.
BC, height and weight were measured.
SRFit survey items described BC, BMI, and Senior Fitness Test movements.
Correlations between the Senior Fitness Test and the SRFit survey assessed concurrent validity.
Cronbach's Alpha measured internal consistency within each SRFit domain.
SRFit domain scores were compared with SF-36, IPAQ, and Rejeski survey scores to assess construct validity.
Correlations between SRFit and the Senior Fitness Test domains ranged from 0.35 to 0.79.
Cronbach's Alpha scores were .75 to .85.
Correlations between SRFit and other survey scores were -0.23 to 0.72 and in the expected direction.
Intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.79 to 0.93.
Initial evaluation supports the SRFit survey's validity and reliability.
