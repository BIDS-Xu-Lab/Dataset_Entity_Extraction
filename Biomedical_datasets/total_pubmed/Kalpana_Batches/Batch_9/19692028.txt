We describe the application and results of modified Young-Dees-Leadbetter bladder neck reconstruction after successful complete primary repair in the newborn period.
The records of 34 patients referred for a continence procedure after successful exstrophy closure were extracted from an institutionally approved database.
Patient characteristics and surgical outcomes were assessed.
A total of 31 male and 3 female patients were identified, of whom 27 and 1, respectively, underwent osteotomy at initial closure.
No patients attained urinary continence and so they were referred for a continence procedure.
Nine patients did not have adequate bladder capacity for bladder neck repair (mean bladder capacity 63 ml, range 20 to 80).
In those with suitable capacity mean capacity was 119 ml (range 85 to 180) and they underwent bladder neck reconstruction at a mean age of 4.9 years.
Of the 25 patients who underwent bladder neck repair 14 (56%) were dry during the day and night, 5 (20%) were dry during the day but wet at night and 6 (24%) were totally incontinent.
Pelvic osteotomies were performed at initial closure in 14 totally continent patients (100%) and in 4 (80%) with daytime continence but in no totally incontinent patients.
All continent patients underwent hypospadias repair before age 1 year and none required ureteral reimplantation before bladder neck repair.
A number of patients require bladder neck reconstruction to achieve continence after successful initial closure with complete primary repair.
The modified Young-Dees-Leadbetter technique provides reasonable results with daytime and nighttime dryness attained by more than half of the patients.
