Growth is characterized by the interplay between cell division and cell expansion, two processes that occur separated along the growth zone at the maize leaf.
To gain further insight into the transition between cell division and cell expansion, conditions were investigated in which the position of this transition zone was positively or negatively affected.
High levels of gibberellic acid (GA) in plants overexpressing the GA biosynthesis gene GA20-OXIDASE (GA20OX-1OE ) shifted the transition zone more distally, whereas mild drought, which is associated with lowered GA biosynthesis, resulted in a more basal positioning.
However, the increased levels of GA in the GA20OX-1OE line were insufficient to convey tolerance to the mild drought treatment, indicating that another mechanism in addition to lowered GA levels is restricting growth during drought.
Transcriptome analysis with high spatial resolution indicated that mild drought specifically induces a reprogramming of transcriptional regulation in the division zone.
'Leaf Growth Viewer' was developed as an online searchable tool containing the high-resolution data.
