Older adults face barriers to specialty care, such as occupational therapy (OT), and these challenges are worse for rural older adults.
While in-home video telehealth may increase access to OT, older adults' health- and technology-related challenges may necessitate caregiver assistance.
This study examines caregiver assistance with in-home OT video telehealth visits from the perspectives of OT practitioners at Veterans Health Administration (VHA).
A web-based national survey of VHA OT practitioners about caregivers' role in video telehealth was conducted between January and February 2022.
Survey items were developed with input from subject matter experts in geriatrics and OT and identified patient factors that necessitate caregiver participation; the extent to which caregivers assist with different types of tasks (technological and clinical tasks); and the perceived facilitators of, benefits of, and barriers to caregiver involvement.
Of approximately 1787 eligible VHA OT practitioners, 286 (16% response rate) participated.
Not all survey items required completion, resulting in different denominators.
Most respondents were female (183/226, 81%), White (163/225, 72.4%), and occupational therapists (275/286, 96.2%).
Respondents were from 87 VHA medical centers, the catchment areas of which served a patient population that was 34% rural, on average (SD 0.22).
Most participants (162/232, 69.8%) had >10 years of OT experience serving a patient cohort mostly aged â‰¥65 years (189/232, 81.5%) in primarily outpatient rehabilitation (132/232, 56.9%).
The top patient factors necessitating caregiver involvement were lack of technical skills, cognitive impairment, and advanced patient age, with health-related impairments (eg, hearing or vision loss) less frequent.
Technological tasks that caregivers most frequently assisted with were holding, angling, moving, repositioning, or operating the camera (136/250, 54.4%) and enabling and operating the microphone and setting the volume (126/248, 50.8%).
Clinical tasks that caregivers most frequently assisted with were providing patient history (143/239, 59.8%) and assisting with patient communication (124/240, 51.7%).
The top facilitator of caregiver participation was clinician-delivered caregiver education about what to expect from video telehealth (152/275, 55.3%), whereas the top barrier was poor connectivity (80/235, 34%).
Increased access to video telehealth (212/235, 90.2%) was the top-rated benefit of caregiver participation.
Most respondents (164/232, 70.7%) indicated that caregivers were at least sometimes unavailable or unable to assist with video telehealth, in which case the appointment often shifted to phone.
Caregivers routinely assist VHA patients with in-home OT video visits, which is invaluable to patients who are older and have complex medical needs.
Barriers to caregiver involvement include caregivers' challenges with video telehealth or inability to assist, or lack of available caregivers.
By elucidating the caregiver support role in video visits, this study provides clinicians with strategies to effectively partner with caregivers to enhance older patients' access to video visits.
