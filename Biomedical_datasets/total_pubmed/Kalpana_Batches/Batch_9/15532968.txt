The objectives of this study were to document and compare patterns of licit and illicit drug use among adolescents in a health board region in 1997 and 2002.
1516 students in 1997 and 1426 in 2002, randomly selected from post-primary schools in the region, completed a questionnaire, incorporating items related to smoking, alcohol and illicit drug use.
Lifetime smoking prevalence in 2002 (50.8%) showed a statistically significant decrease from 1997 (57.1%).
There was also a statistically significant decrease in regular smoking (1997 - 30.7%; 2002 - 18.2%).
There was no significant change in regular alcohol consumption (57.3% - 1997; 53.7% - 2002).
However, there was an increase in binge drinking at weekends and reports of feeling drunk more than ten times (24% - 1997; 27.2% - 2002).
In 2002, 41.2% had ever taken an illicit drug, a statistically significant increase from 1997 (34.9%); 15.1% were regular users, also a statistically significant increase from 1997 (11.9%).
These findings highlight that while the misuse of illicit drugs has increased, smoking has significantly declined since 1997.
However, alcohol continues to be a major problem within this age-group.
This study has implications for the implementation of services and strategies aimed at reducing smoking, alcohol and drug use within this population.
