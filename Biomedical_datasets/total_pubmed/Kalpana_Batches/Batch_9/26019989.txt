Independent and American Samoa have a shared cultural, genetic, ethnolinguistic, and historical background but have been politically separated since 1899.
In this essay, we examine the health of these two polities and identify two key health patterns that have emerged even as American Samoa has achieved a higher per capita income than Independent Samoa.

Limited data remains a persistent challenge to conducting analysis of public health in the Pacific islands, particularly in American Samoa.
