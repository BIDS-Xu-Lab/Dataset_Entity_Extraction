The 5th Annual Anti-Cancer Drug Discovery and Development Summit brought together an international group of academic and industry scientists to discuss recent therapeutic developments in the field of oncology.
The focus of the meeting was novel targeted approaches, i.e., those agents directed against targets that are overexpressed or overactive in tumour cells.
It was acknowledged that cytotoxic agents will continue to play a key role in the treatment of cancer and new developments in this area were also discussed.
With over 400 anticancer drugs in clinical development and a number of recent registrations, there is great optimism that significant therapeutic advances can be made.
