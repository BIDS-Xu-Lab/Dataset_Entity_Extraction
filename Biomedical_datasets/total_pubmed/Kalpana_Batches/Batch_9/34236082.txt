Plant-derived bioactive molecules display potential antiviral activity against various viral targets including mode of viral entry and its replication in host cells.
Considering the challenges and search for antiviral agents, this review provides substantiated data on chemical constituents of edible fruits with promising antiviral activity.
The bioactive constituents like naringenin, mangiferin, α-mangostin, geraniin, punicalagin, and lectins of edible fruits exhibit antiviral effect by inhibiting viral replication against IFV, DENV, polio, CHIKV, Zika, HIV, HSV, HBV, HCV, and SARS-CoV.
The significance of edible fruit phytochemicals to block the virulence of various deadly viruses through their inhibitory action against the entry and replication of viral genetic makeup and proteins are discussed.
In view of the antiviral property of active constituents of edible fruits which can strengthen the immune system and reduce oxidative stress, they are suggested to be diet supplements to combat various viral diseases including COVID-19.
Considering the increasing threat of COVID-19, it is suggested to examine the therapeutic efficacy of existing antiviral molecules of edible fruits which may provide prophylactic and adjuvant therapy with their potential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-modulatory effects.
Several active molecules like geraniin, naringenin, (2R,4R)-1,2,4-trihydroxyheptadec-16-one, betacyanins, mangiferin, punicalagin, isomangiferin, procyanidin B2, quercetin, marmelide, jacalin lectin, banana lectin, and α-mangostin isolated from various edible fruits have showed promising antiviral properties against different pathogenic viruses.
Especially flavonoid compounds extracted from edible fruits possess potential antiviral activity against a wide array of viruses like HIV-1, HSV-1 and 2, HCV, INF, dengue, yellow fever, NSV, and Zika virus infection.
Hence taking such fruits or edible fruits and their constituents/compounds as dietary supplements could deliver adequate plasma levels in the body to optimize the cell and tissue levels and could lead to possible benefits for the preventive measures for this pandemic COVID-19 situation.
