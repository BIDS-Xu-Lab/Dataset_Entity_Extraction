The development of infected pseudoaneurysms (PAs) following carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is extremely rare.
We retrospectively reviewed the data from 13 such aneurysms (in 12 patients) repaired over a period of 35 years at the Texas Heart Institute (THI) and included an overview of published cases to analyze the epidemiology, mode of presentation, methods of repair, and outcome.
The diagnosis of PA should be considered when a patient develops a persistent hematoma, recurrent bleeding from the wound, or late wound infection.
Sepsis is occasionally a presenting symptom.
Surgical therapy for infected PAs can be challenging; excision of the aneurysm followed by autologous grafting constitutes the favored approach.
Traditionally, Dacron patch repair has been associated with a high incidence of reinfection.
Carotid artery ligation is required in a large percentage of cases (22.7%) and is associated with a prohibitive rate of death/major stroke (50%) compared with a low (12%) risk following arterial reconstruction.
Prevention and early diagnosis of infected PAs are essential to limit complications and mortality.
