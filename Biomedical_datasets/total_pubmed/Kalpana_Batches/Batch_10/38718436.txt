Immune checkpoints inhibitors are effective but it needs more precise biomarkers for patient selection.
We explored the biological significance of LINC00862 in pan-cancer by bioinformatics.
And we studied its regulatory mechanisms using chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA immunoprecipitation assays etc.
TCGA and single-cell sequencing data analysis indicated that LINC00862 was overexpressed in the majority of tumor and stromal cells, which was related with poor prognosis.
LINC00862 expression was related with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoints expression, and had a high predictive value for immunotherapy efficacy.
Mechanistically, LINC00862 competitively bound to miR-29c-3p to unleash SIRT1's tumor-promoting function.
SIRT1 inhibitor-EX527 were screened by virtual screening and verified by in vitro and vivo assays.
Notably, acetyltransferase P300-mediated super-enhancer activity stimulated LINC00862 transcription.
Collectively, LINC00862 could be a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker.
LINC00862 could also be a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy efficacy.
Super-enhancer activity is the driver for LINC00862 overexpression in cervical cancer and gastric cancer.
