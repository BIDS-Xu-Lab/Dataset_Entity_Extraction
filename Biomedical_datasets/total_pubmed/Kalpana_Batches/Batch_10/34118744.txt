Adults with spinal deformity (ASD) are known to have postural malalignment affecting their quality of life.
Classical evaluation and follow-up are usually based on full-body static radiographs and health related quality of life questionnaires.
Despite being an essential daily life activity, formal gait assessment lacks in clinical practice.
What are the main alterations in gait kinematics of ASD and their radiological determinants?
52 ASD and 63 control subjects underwent full-body 3D gait analysis with calculation of joint kinematics and full-body biplanar X-rays with calculation of 3D postural parameters.
Kinematics and postural parameters were compared between groups.
Determinants of gait alterations among postural radiographic parameters were explored.
ASD had increased sagittal vertical axis (SVA:34 ± 59 vs -5 ± 20 mm), pelvic tilt (PT:19 ± 13 vs 11 ± 6°) and frontal Cobb (25 ± 21 vs 4 ± 6°) compared to controls (all p < 0.001).
ASD displayed decrease walking speed (0.9 ± 0.3 vs 1.2 ± 0.2 m/s), step length (0.58 ± 0.11 vs 0.64 ± 0.07 m) and increased single support (0.45 ± 0.05 vs 0.42 ± 0.04 s).
ASD walked with decreased hip extension in stance (-3 ± 10 vs -7 ± 8°), increased knee flexion at initial contact and in stance (10 ± 11 vs 5 ± 10° and 19 ± 7 vs 16 ± 8° respectively), and decreased knee flexion/extension ROM (55 ± 9 vs 59 ± 7°).
ASD had increased trunk flexion (12 ± 12 vs 6 ± 11°) and reduced dynamic lumbar lordosis (-11 ± 12 vs -15 ± 7°, all p < 0.001).
Sagittal knee ROM, walking speed and step length were negatively determined by SVA; lack of lumbar lordosis during gait was negatively determined by radiological lumbar lordosis.
Static compensations in ASD persist during gait, where they exhibit a flexed attitude at the trunk, hips and knees, reduced hip and knee mobility and loss of dynamic lordosis.
ASD walked at a slower pace with increased single and double support times that might contribute to their gait stability.
These dynamic discrepancies were strongly related to static sagittal malalignment.
