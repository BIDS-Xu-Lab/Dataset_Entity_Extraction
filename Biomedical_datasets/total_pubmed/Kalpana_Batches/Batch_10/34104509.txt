This study aims to compare the success, complications, and long-term outcomes of aortic balloon valvuloplasty and surgical aortic valvuloplasty in pediatric patients with congenital aortic valve stenosis.
Between March 2000 and October 2019, a total of 267 procedures, including 238 balloon valvuloplasties and 29 surgical valvuloplasties, in 198 children (135 males, 63 females; mean age: 57.4±62.6 months; range, 0.03 to 219 months) were retrospectively analyzed.
The hospital records, echocardiographic images, catheterization data, angiography images, and operative data were reviewed.
Aortic regurgitation was mild in 73 patients before balloon valvuloplasty, and none of the patients had moderate-to-severe aortic regurgitation.
Compared to surgical valvuloplasty, the rate of increase in the aortic regurgitation after balloon valvuloplasty was significantly higher (p=0.012).
The patients who underwent balloon valvuloplasty did not need reintervention for a mean period of 46±45.6 months, whereas this period was significantly longer in those who underwent surgical valvuloplasty (mean 80.5±53.9 months)
The overall failure rate was 8%.
Moderate-to-severe aortic regurgitation was the most important complication developing due to balloon valvuloplasty in the early period (13%).
The mean length of hospitalization after balloon valvuloplasty was significantly shorter than surgical valvuloplasty (p=0.026).
During follow-up, a total of 168 patients continued their follow-up, and a reinterventional or surgical intervention was not needed in 78 patients (47%).
Aortic balloon valvuloplasty can be repeated safely and helps to eliminate aortic valve stenosis without needing sternotomy.
Surgical valvuloplasty can be successfully performed in patients in whom the expected benefit from aortic balloon valvuloplasty is not achieved.
