Cellular energetics is thought to have played a key role in dictating all major evolutionary transitions in the history of life on Earth.
However, how exactly cellular energetics and metabolism come together to shape evolutionary paths is not well understood.
In particular, when an organism is evolved in different energy environments, what are the phenomenological differences in the chosen evolutionary trajectories, is a question that is not well understood.
In this context, starting from an Escherichia coli K-12 strain, we evolve the bacterium in five different carbon environments-glucose, arabinose, xylose, rhamnose and a mixture of these four sugars (in a predefined ratio) for approximately 2,000 generations.
At the end of the adaptation period, we quantify and compare the growth dynamics of the strains in a variety of environments.
The evolved strains show no specialized adaptation towards growth in the carbon medium in which they were evolved.
Rather, in all environments, the evolved strains exhibited a reduced lag phase and an increased growth rate.
Sequencing results reveal that these dynamical properties are not introduced via mutations in the precise loci associated with utilization of the sugar in which the bacterium evolved.
These phenotypic changes are rather likely introduced via mutations elsewhere on the genome.
Data from our experiments indicate that evolution in a defined environment does not alter hierarchy in mixed-sugar utilization in bacteria.
