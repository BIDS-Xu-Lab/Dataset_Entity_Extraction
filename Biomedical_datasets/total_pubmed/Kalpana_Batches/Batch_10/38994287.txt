Surgical care of the hand plays a crucial role in the medical field, as problems with the hand can profoundly affect a patient's quality of life and function.
In order to meet the needs of patients, improve patient satisfaction and improve treatment outcomes, high-quality service models have been introduced in the field of nursing.
To explore the effect analysis of applying high-quality service model to surgical nursing.
We conducted a retrospective study of patients who underwent hand surgery at our hospital between 2019 and 2022, using a quality service model that included improved patient education, pain management, care team collaboration, and effective communication.
Another group of patients received traditional care as a control group.
We compared postoperative recovery, satisfaction, complication rate, and length of hospital stay between the two groups.
Inferential statistics were used to compare the difference between the two groups by independent sample t test, Chi-square test and other methods to evaluate the effect of intervention measures.
Postoperative recovery time decreased from 17.8 ± 2.3 d to 14.5 ± 2.1 d, pain score decreased from 4.7 ± 1.9 to 3.2 ± 1.4, and hand function score increased from 78.4 ± 7.1 to 88.5 ± 6.2.
In terms of patient satisfaction, the quality service model group scored 87.3 ± 5.6 points, which was significantly higher than that of the traditional care group (74.6 ± 6.3 points).
At the same time, patients' understanding of medical information also improved from 6.9 ± 1.4 to 8.6 ± 1.2.
In terms of postoperative complications, the application of the quality service model reduced the incidence of postoperative complications from 26% to 10%, the incidence of infection from 12% to 5%, and the incidence of bleeding from 10% to 3%.
The reduction in these data indicates that the quality service model plays a positive role in reducing the risk of complications.
In addition, the average hospital stay of patients in the quality service model group was shortened from 6.8 ± 1.5 d to 5.2 ± 1.3 d, and the hospitalization cost was also reduced from 2800 ± 600 yuan to 2500 ± 500 yuan.
Applying a quality service model to hand surgery care can significantly improve patient clinical outcomes, including faster recovery, less pain, greater satisfaction, and reduced complication rates.
