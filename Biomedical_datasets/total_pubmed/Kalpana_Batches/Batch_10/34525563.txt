In this paper, we study collective interaction dynamics emerging in the game of football (soccer).
To do so, we surveyed a database containing body-sensor traces measured during three professional football matches, where we observed statistical patterns that we used to propose a stochastic model for the players' motion in the field.
The model, which is based on linear interactions, captures to a good approximation the spatiotemporal dynamics of a football team.
Our theoretical framework, therefore, can be an effective analytical tool to uncover the underlying cooperative mechanisms behind the complexity of football plays.
Moreover, we showed that it can provide handy theoretical support for coaches to evaluate teams' and players' performances in both training sessions and competitive scenarios.
