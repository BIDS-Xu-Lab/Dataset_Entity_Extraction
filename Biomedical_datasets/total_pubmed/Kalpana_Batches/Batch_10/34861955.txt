This study aimed to assess the level of knowledge, awareness, and compliance with standard precautions and to examine individual factors related to compliance with standard precautions among psychiatric nurses.
Data were collected from September 2020 to March 2021.
A total of 160 questionnaires were distributed, and a total sample of 134 valid questionnaires was analyzed.
Compliance with standard precautions was significantly correlated with knowledge and awareness.
Awareness (β = 0.547, p < .001) was a significant factor of compliance with a total explanatory power of 35.0% (F = 7.27, p < .001).
Thus, the current coronavirus disease pandemic has significantly influenced the mental health infection system.
These findings highlighted that psychiatric nurse must continue their efforts to improve compliance with infection prevention to prepare for an uncertain future with potential pandemics.
