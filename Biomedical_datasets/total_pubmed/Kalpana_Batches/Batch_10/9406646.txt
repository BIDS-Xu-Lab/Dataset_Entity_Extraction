Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common cause of congenital and perinatal infections throughout the world.
High prevalence of CMV infection is associated mainly with universal breast feeding practices rather than with crowding or poverty.
Perinatal CMV infection usually follows a benign course in immunocompetent individuals, but the virus remains latent or persistent in the host cell thereafter.
As a clinical diagnosis of CMV infection is generally not easy, rapid and accurate laboratory diagnosis of CMV infection is required for appropriate patient management.
Numerous anti-CMV compounds including ganciclovir, foscarnet and cidofovir have been reported, most of them are unlikely in a clinical trial for perinatal CMV infection in immunocompetent individuals.
Understanding the epidemiology of CMV is a key element in the development of strategies for prevention and treatment of infection.
This review focuses on recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of perinatal CMV infections in infants.
Entirely new approaches to prevention and treatment of CMV infections in infants are necessary, including antiviral interventions and the development of a vaccine strategy.
