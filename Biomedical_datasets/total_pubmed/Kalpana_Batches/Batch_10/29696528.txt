There is paucity of empirical data regarding the use of either clozapine or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the acute phase and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults with intellectual disability.
Herein we report the successful acute and long-term remission of psychotic symptoms and catatonia with the combination of clozapine and ECT in a 26-year-old female with moderate ID and treatment-resistant schizophrenia.
To our knowledge, this is the first case example of the successful use of the combination of bilateral, standard-pulse ECT and clozapine in both acute and long-term treatment of treatment-resistant schizophrenia and catatonia in an adult with ID.
Our report adds further support to the emerging evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of this combination in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.
