Through a series of semistructured interviews with 12 nurses delivering direct patient care in acute, long-term and home care settings, information was sought regarding the ethical concerns of practicing nurses.
Although these nurses frequently did not specifically identify the areas of expressed concern as ethical in nature, thematic analysis of the transcribed interviews uncovered four major ethical areas of concern common to these 12 nurses.
These areas are: (1) Withholding of information and truth-telling; (2) Unequal access or inequalities in care; (3) Differences between business and professional values; (4) Breaking and reporting broken rules.
Several reasons are offered to explain the failure of nurses accurately to identify specific practice dilemmas as ethical in nature and the sequelae of these failures.
Possibilities involving ongoing education and mentored experiences in practice areas are reported.
