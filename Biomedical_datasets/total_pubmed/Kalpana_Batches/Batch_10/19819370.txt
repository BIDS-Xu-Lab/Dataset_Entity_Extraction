The severity of industrial accidents in which a domino effect takes place is well known in the chemical and process industry.
The application of an inherent safety approach for the prevention of escalation events leading to domino accidents was explored in the present study.
Reference primary scenarios were analyzed and escalation vectors were defined.
Inherent safety distances were defined and proposed as a metric to express the intensity of the escalation vectors.
Simple rules of thumb were presented for a preliminary screening of these distances.
Swift reference indices for layout screening with respect to escalation hazard were also defined.
Two case studies derived from existing layouts of oil refineries were selected to understand the potentialities coming from the application in the methodology.
The results evidenced that the approach allows a first comparative assessment of the actual domino hazard in a layout, and the identification of critical primary units with respect to escalation events.
The methodology developed also represents a useful screening tool to identify were to dedicate major efforts in the design of add-on measures, optimizing conventional passive and active measures for the prevention of severe domino accidents.
