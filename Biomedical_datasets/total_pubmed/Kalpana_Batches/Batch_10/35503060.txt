To evaluate oncological outcomes in patient with positive surgical margin (PSM) following partial nephrectomy (PN).
In this retrospective study, we enrolled the data of patients who underwent PN between 2008 and 2017.
The inclusion criteria were a definite diagnosis of kidney tumor who underwent PN with at least one year follow up.
From the 450 patients who underwent PN, The PSM was found in 35 (22 male/13 female) patients.
18/237 (7.6%) and 17/213 (7.9%) of them were in open and laparoscopic group, respectively.
Clear cell RCC was the most prevalent pathology (18 patients) in the PSM patients.
The mean time of follow up was 46Â±2.02 months.
Recurrence was developed in 5 (14.2%) patients.
There was no correlation between recurrence and sex (p=1.00), surgery type (p=0.658), age (p=0.869), tumor size (p= 0.069), pathology (p=0.258) and stage (p=0.744) in PSM patients.
Recurrence free survival was similar between the open and laparoscopy groups in PSM patients (p=0.619).
Beside numerous advantages of minimally invasive techniques, laparoscopic approach would be comparable to conventional open partial nephrectomy in terms of oncologic outcomes.
The rate of recurrence following partial nephrectomy in PSM patients is considerable and closely monitoring is mandatory.
