Physical activity is favourably considered for its effect on metabolic fitness and body composition.
This observation is generally supported by observational studies and is concordant with endurance-trained individuals' metabolic and morphological profiles.
However, in some contexts, the measurement of physical activity habits may not provide an adequate representation of its benefits.
In this paper, we review relevant literature on the respective effects of fitness and physical activity on anthropometric and metabolic variables and the informative potential of a classification based on aerobic fitness and activity indicators.
The relevance to defining a profile based on both fitness and activity is reinforced by data from the Quebec Family Study showing that, in both men and women, "fit-active" individuals displayed a much more favourable morphological and metabolic profile than "unfit-inactive" individuals.
Moreover, these benefits seemed to be more related to variations in fitness than in physical activity.
In summary, evidence suggests that a profile combining information on aerobic fitness and physical activity may better reflect the lifelong impact of physical activity on body composition and health.
The fit-active profile better reflects the long-term benefits of vigorous physical activity participation on health.
The reported benefits seem to be more related to variations in aerobic fitness than to those in physical activity.
