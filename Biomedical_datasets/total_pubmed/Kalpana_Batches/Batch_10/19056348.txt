We previously reported that hypoxic stress enhanced osteoclast differentiation via increasing insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) production.
However, the mechanisms underlying IGF2 stimulation remains unknown.
In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of osteoclastogenesis by IGF2 treatment.
Primary mouse bone marrow cells were cultured with IGF2.
Total RNAs were applied to a DNA microarray analysis, and quantitative RT-PCR was then used to confirm the microarray data and clarify which cells expressed the relative genes.
The most interesting findings were the upregulations of CXC chemokine ligand 7 (CXCL7) expression in stromal cells and stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1) expression in osteoblastic cells with IGF2 treatment.
The addition of exogenous SDF1 to CXCL7 increased the number of osteoclasts and promoted the formation of giant osteoclasts.
These results suggest that IGF2 modulates the microenvironment around osteoclast precursor cells.
SDF1 together with CXCL7 may promote the formation of giant osteoclasts.
