Systemic manifestations of infectious disease may be confused with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), leading to potential patient morbidity and mortality.
We report the case of a patient with severe renal failure and liver involvement who was initially diagnosed and treated for leptospirosis infection.
It was later determined that his organ involvement was related to active SLE.
We review the clinical and laboratory features common to both SLE and leptospirosis infection to highlight not only the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for infectious organisms in a patient with a suspect travel history but also the recognition of atypical features of a systemic autoimmune disease.
