A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the NIST, USA and the BIPM in the medium-energy x-ray range.
The results show the standards to be in agreement at the level of the standard uncertainty of the comparison of 3.8 parts in 103, except at 250 kV where the difference is 1.5 times the standard uncertainty.
The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.
