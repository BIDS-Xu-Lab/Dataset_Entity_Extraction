The voltage-sensing domain (VSD) is a module capable of responding to changes in the membrane potential through conformational changes and facilitating electromechanical coupling to open a pore gate, activate proton permeation pathways, or promote enzymatic activity in some membrane-anchored phosphatases.
To carry out these functions, this module acts cooperatively through conformational changes.
The VSD is formed by four transmembrane segments (S1-S4) but the S4 segment is critical since it carries positively charged residues, mainly Arg or Lys, which require an aqueous environment for its proper function.
The discovery of this module in voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs), proton channels (Hv1), and voltage sensor-containing phosphatases (VSPs) has expanded our understanding of the principle of modularity in the voltage-sensing mechanism of these proteins.
Here, by sequence comparison and the evaluation of the relationship between sequence composition, intrinsic flexibility, and structural analysis in 14 selected representatives of these three major protein groups, we report five interesting differences in the folding patterns of the VSD both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
Our main findings indicate that this module is highly conserved throughout the evolutionary scale, however: (1) segments S1 to S3 in eukaryotes are significantly more hydrophobic than those present in prokaryotes; (2) the S4 segment has retained its hydrophilic character; (3) in eukaryotes the extramembranous linkers are significantly larger and more flexible in comparison with those present in prokaryotes; (4) the sensors present in the kHv1 proton channel and the ciVSP phosphatase, both of eukaryotic origin, exhibit relationships of flexibility and folding patterns very close to the typical ones found in prokaryotic voltage sensors; and (5) archaeal channels KvAP and MVP have flexibility profiles which are clearly contrasting in the S3-S4 region, which could explain their divergent activation mechanisms.
Finally, to elucidate the obscure origins of this module, we show further evidence for a possible connection between voltage sensors and TolQ proteins.
