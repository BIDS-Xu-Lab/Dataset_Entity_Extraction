The laparoscopic management of early-stage ovarian cancer remains controversial.
Some surgeons hesitate to perform laparoscopic staging due to concern with the adequacy of staging, the possibility of tumor spillage and risk of port-site metastasis.
Previous studies and literature reviews have reinforced the argument and supported the use of laparoscopy.
However, the results were drawn with limited sample size obtained from case-series and case-control studies which result in difficult to make definite conclusions.
Till date, the list of laparoscopic procedures has grown at a pace consistent with improvements in technology and technical skill of the surgeon.
The number of studies with larger sample size, more prospective data, and longer duration of follow-up has been increasing.
This review serves as an update on safety, feasibility, surgical, and oncological outcomes in cases of early-stage ovarian cancer treated by laparoscopic surgery of the literature published since 2008.
We aim to clarify whether laparoscopy is safe and effective enough to be considered as standard management.
Rely on nonrandomize studies, the current clinical evidence supports the role of laparoscopy in the management of early-stage ovarian cancer.
Laparoscopy appears to offer several perioperative benefits without compromise of surgical morbidity and oncological outcome.
