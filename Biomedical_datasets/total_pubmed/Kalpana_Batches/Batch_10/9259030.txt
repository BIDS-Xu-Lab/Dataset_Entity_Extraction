The availability of personal computer programs for individualizing drug dosage regimens has stimulated the interest in modelling population pharmacokinetics.
Data from 82 adolescent and adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who were treated with intravenous tobramycin because of an exacerbation of their pulmonary infection were analysed with a non-parametric expectation maximization (NPEM) algorithm.
This algorithm estimates the entire discrete joint probability density of the pharmacokinetic parameters.
It also provides traditional parametric statistics such as the means, standard deviation, median, covariances and correlations among the various parameters.
It also provides graphic-2- and 3-dimensional representations of the marginal densities of the parameters investigated.
Several models for intravenous tobramycin in adolescent and adult patients with CF were compared.
Covariates were total body weight (for the volume of distribution) and creatinine clearance (for the total body clearance and elimination rate).
Because of lack of data on patients with poor renal function, restricted models with non-renal clearance and the non-renal elimination rate constant fixed at literature values of 0.15 L/h and 0.01 h-1 were also included.
In this population, intravenous tobramycin could be best described by median (+/-dispersion factor) volume of distribution per unit of total body weight of 0.28 +/- 0.05 L/kg, elimination rate constant of 0.25 +/- 0.10 h-1 and elimination rate constant per unit of creatinine clearance of 0.0008 +/- 0.0009 h-1/(ml/min/1.73 m2).
Analysis of populations of increasing size showed that using a restricted model with a non-renal elimination rate constant fixed at 0.01 h-1, a model based on a population of only 10 to 20 patients, contained parameter values similar to those of the entire population and, using the full model, a larger population (at least 40 patients) was needed.
