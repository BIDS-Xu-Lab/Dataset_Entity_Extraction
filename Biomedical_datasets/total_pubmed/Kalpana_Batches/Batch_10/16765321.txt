Gymnema sylvestre (gymnema) contains gurmarin that selectively inhibits responses to sweet substances in rodents.
The present study investigated possible interaction between gurmarin and the submandibular saliva in rats fed diet containing gymnema.
Electrophoretic analyses demonstrated that relative amounts of two proteins in the saliva clearly increased in rats fed the gymnema diet.
However, rats previously given section of the bilateral glossopharyngeal nerve showed no such salivary protein induction.
rK2 and rK9, a family of serine proteases, have a striking resemblance of cleavage site in the protein substrates.
Interestingly, gurmarin possesses comparable residues with those rK2 and rK9 prefer.
The kallikreins significantly inhibited immunoreaction between gurmarin and antigurmarin antiserum.
These results suggest that rK2 and rK9 increased by chemosensory information for the gymnema diet via the glossopharyngeal nerve might cleave gurmarin or at least cause specific binding with it.
