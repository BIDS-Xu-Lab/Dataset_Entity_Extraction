Infection with SARS-CoV-2 induces a proinflammatory state that causes hyperglycemia and may precipitate diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in patients with known or new-onset diabetes.
We examined the trends in new-onset diabetes and DKA prior to and following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
This single-center retrospective observational study included pediatric patients (aged 0 to <18 years) hospitalized with new-onset type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes (T2D) before (March 1, 2018, to February 29, 2020) and after (March 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020) the pandemic onset.
Demographic, anthropometrics, laboratory and clinical data, and outcomes were obtained.
Among 615 children admitted with new-onset diabetes during the entire study period, 401 were admitted before the pandemic onset, and 214 were admitted after the pandemic onset.
Children admitted with new-onset diabetes in the postpandemic period were significantly more likely to present with DKA (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-2.52) than in the prepandemic phase.
Children with DKA after the pandemic onset had higher lengths of hospitalization and were significantly more likely to experience severe DKA (odds ratio, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.34-3.52).
A higher proportion of children with DKA admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit required oxygen support after the pandemic onset than before the pandemic onset (8.85% vs 1.92%).
Most cases of T2D with DKA occurred following the onset of the pandemic (62.5%).
A significant increase in T2D cases occurred following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic with a greater risk of DKA and severe ketoacidosis.
Racial disparity was evident with a higher proportion of Black and American Indian children presenting with ketoacidosis following the pandemic onset.
