The genus Orobanche, Cistanche and Boschniakia are taxonomically classified as members of Orobanchaceae.
The medicinal plants of these three genera are closely related, and their traditional curative effects are similar.
As representative compounds, phenethyl glycosides are predominantly dominant type both in amount and in chemical structural varieties, which are considered to be the important bioactive material basis of these genera.
In this paper, phenethyl glycosides and their pharmacological activities are described in a single list.
In addition, the other compounds were also reviewed in order to better compare the difference of the bioactive substances.
These findings have important reference value for effective development and rational utilization of resources of medicinal plants in the family Orobanchaceae.
