Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at risk for co-occurring medical conditions, many of which have also been reported among individuals with mutations in ASD-associated genes.
This study examined rates of co-occurring medical conditions across 301 individuals with disruptive mutations to 1 of 18 ASD-risk genes in comparison to rates of conditions in an idiopathic ASD sample.
Rates of gastrointestinal problems, seizures, physical anomalies, and immune problems were generally elevated, with significant differences in rates observed between groups.
Results may inform medical care of individuals with ASD-associated mutations and research into mechanisms of co-occurring medical conditions in ASD.
