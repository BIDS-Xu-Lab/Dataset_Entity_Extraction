Immunostaining of non-adherent cells is commonly performed after adhesion of cells onto microscope slides either using cytocentrifugation or with the help of charged coating substrates.
These techniques, however, require either specialized equipment or significant preparation time.
Here, we describe a method for immunofluorescent staining of lymphocytes within multi-well culture plates, where cells suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) are adhered to either the plastic well bottom or glass coverslips by gravity sedimentation.
This technique requires only common laboratory materials, no coating steps, and allows for densely adherent cell coverage with 1 Ã— 106 cells.
Our data show that suspension of cells in PBS, but not serum-containing growth medium, allows for adhesion to plastic or glass after 30 min of gravity sedimentation.
We show that this method is applicable for immunofluorescent staining of both primary human lymphocytes and immortalized lymphoma cells, and that it preserves cell morphology.
