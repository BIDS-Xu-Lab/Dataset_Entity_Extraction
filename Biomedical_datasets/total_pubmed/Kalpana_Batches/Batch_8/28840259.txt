Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a rare, chronic disease of viral etiology which is characterized by multiple, recurrent growth of papillomas in the aerodigestive tract.
The surgical outcomes and the recurrence rates of 106 patients with RRP of the larynx were analyzed.
The patients were treated at the University of Magdeburg between 1983 and 2014.
The surgical outcomes of conventional and laser surgery regarding time to relapse and complications were compared.
In addition, the influence of the quadrivalent vaccine Gardasil® on the disease was analyzed in 10 patients.
Children with RRP had a statistically significant greater number of surgeries throughout their lifetimes compared to adult patients.
There were no differences between the adult (n = 79) and juvenile (n = 27) groups in the time to relapse and the number of surgeries/year.
The time to relapse and number of procedures/year were not influenced by the various surgical methods.
Complications after conventional and laser surgery were not statistically different between the two groups.
Serious complications and the need for a tracheotomy were only reported after conventional surgery.
In the 10 patients who were immunized with Gardasil®, a statistically significant lower number of surgeries/year after vaccination was achieved.
Treatment requires experience and may be very difficult.
The analysis of the course of the disease has shown that the treatment of choice is surgical excision with the CO2 laser combined with the quadrivalent or polyvalent vaccine.
Consequent vaccination of both boys and girls has the potential to reduce the occurrence of RRP.
