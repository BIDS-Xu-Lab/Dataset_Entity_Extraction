Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is the most widely used brominated flame retardant (BFR), and it bioaccumulates throughout the food chains.
Its fate in the first trophic level, plants, is of special interest.
In this study, a four-day hydroponic exposure of TBBPA at a concentration of 1 Î¼mol L-1 to pumpkin seedlings was conducted.
A nontarget screening method for hydrophilic bromine-containing metabolites was modified, based on both typical isotope patterns of bromine and mass defect, and used to process mass spectra data.
A total of 20 glycosylation and malonyl glycosylation metabolites were found for TBBPA in the pumpkin plants.
Representative glycosyl TBBPA reference standards were synthesized to evaluate the contribution of this glycosylation process.
Approximately 86% of parent TBBPA was metabolized to form those 20 glycosyl TBBPAs, showing that glycosylation was the most dominant metabolism pathway for TBBPA in pumpkin at the tested exposure concentration.
