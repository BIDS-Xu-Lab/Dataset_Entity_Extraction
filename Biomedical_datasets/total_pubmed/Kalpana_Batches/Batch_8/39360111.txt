The pervasive use of mobile phones has raised concerns about their impact on musculoskeletal health, particularly neck pain.
This issue is notably relevant in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, where high mobile phone usage intersects with demographic diversity.
While extensive phone use has been linked to neck pain and other musculoskeletal disorders globally, specific data on this issue in the Eastern Province are limited.
This study addresses this gap by examining phone use patterns, neck positions, and associated symptoms in the region.
Using an online, self-administered survey, this cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between phone use and neck pain in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia.
Participants aged 18 years and older were recruited via social media, community groups, and university networks.
The survey collected data on demographics, phone use patterns, neck positions, awareness of health risks, and pain symptoms.
It was pre-tested, administered through Google Forms (Google, Mountain View, CA), and available for four weeks.
Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and cross-tabulations with SPSS 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).
The study included 400 participants, with 273 females (68.3%) and 127 males (31.8%).
Most participants were single (245, 61.3%) and held a university degree (301, 75.3%).
Daily phone use varied: 228 participants (57.0%) used their phones for less than five hours daily, while 43 (10.8%) used them for 10-15 hours or more.
Neck positions ranged from 0° to 60°, with 168 participants (42.0%) maintaining a 30° angle.
Awareness of health risks associated with phone use was high, with 364 participants (91.0%) aware of these risks.
Neck pain was reported by 244 participants (61.0%), with additional symptoms including headache (22 participants, 5.5%) and upper back pain (five participants, 1.3%).
This study found a significant link between prolonged phone use and neck pain in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia.
Despite high awareness of the risks, many individuals report discomfort.
These findings underscore the need for public health interventions and ergonomic education to improve phone use practices and musculoskeletal health.
