The secretions of the tubular interdigital glands were investigated by conventional (Periodic-Acid Schiff, Alcian-Blue at different pH, Low Iron Diamine and High Iron Diamine) and lectin (Con-A, UEA-I, LTA, WGA, GSA-II, GSA-IB4, SBA, PNA, ECA, DBA, MAL-II and SNA) histochemical methods in adult males and females of different age of fallow deer during the breeding season.
Sialidase digestion and deacetylation pre-treatment were also employed in conjunction with lectin histochemistry.
The glandular epithelium consisted of a single layer of low columnar cells with typical apical protrusions.
No substantial differences of the above histochemical staining in relation to sex and age were observed.
Conventional histochemical staining revealed that the interdigital glands secreted neutral glycoproteins whereas acidic glycocomponents did not seem to be present.
Lectin histochemical technique allowed us to disclose a great heterogeneity of glycoproteins with N- and O-linked oligosaccharides containing alpha-d-Man/alpha-d-Glc, GlcNAc, alpha-Fuc, terminal beta-d-Gal-(1-3)-d-GalNAc, -d-Gal-(1-4)-d-GlcNAc, alpha-Gal and beta-GalNAc residues.
beta-GalNAc and disaccharide beta-d-Gal-(1-3)-d-GalNAc were also found as subterminal to sialyl moieties.
The lack of sexual and age-related differences in the glucidic content of the glandular secretions seems to indicate that the glycoderivatives may play only an accessory role in the production of odoriferous signals in fallow deer.
