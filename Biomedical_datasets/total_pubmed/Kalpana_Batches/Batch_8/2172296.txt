Contagious equine metritis (CEM), a sexually transmitted bacterial disease, was first described in thoroughbred horses.
It also occurs in nonthoroughbred horses, in which it produces isolated, apparently unrelated outbreaks.
Thirty-two strains of Taylorella equigenitalis, the causative agent of CEM, from all over the world were characterized by field inversion gel electrophoresis of fragments of genomic DNA obtained by digestion with low-cleavage-frequency restriction enzymes.
This resulted in a division into five clearly distinct groups.
Strains from thoroughbred horses from all continents belonged to one group.
Strains from nonthoroughbred horses from various countries were different from strains from thoroughbred horses; four groups could be determined.
Two groups contained both streptomycin-resistant and streptomycin-susceptible strains.
The data indicate that CEM in nonthoroughbreds did not originate from the thoroughbred population; also, the reverse was not demonstrated.
Thus, extensive international transportation directives regarding the testing of nonthoroughbred horses for CEM may need reconsideration.
