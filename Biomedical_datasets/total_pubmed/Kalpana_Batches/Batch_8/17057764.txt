There has been a steady increase in the number of Norwegian disability pensioners during the last decade.
The main diagnosis is a musculoskeletal disorder in more than one third.
The aim of this study was to investigate the health condition of those who apply for disability pension due to musculoskeletal complaints.
200 applicants were examined clinically, with emphasis on physical function, self-rated quality of life and lifestyle-related factors.
Current self-evaluated somatic health was evaluated in those with adequate Norwegian language proficiency, by use of five subscales of the Short Form Questionnaire (SF-36).
The median age was 55 years (range 23-67) and 64 % were women.
Approximately one fourth of the applicants were of non-Western origin.
About two thirds had less than 13 years of education and 55% had worked in the service-sector.
59% never did any moderately vigorous exercise.
About one in four were obese.
The estimated maximal oxygen uptake for the 94 who completed a submaximal ergometer bicycle endurance test, was about 20 ml/kg/min (median).
Myofascial pain syndromes and fatigue were the dominant complaints.
Relatively few applicants showed relevant objective signs of disease.
SF-36 scores for this group were significantly lower than those for age-adjusted population-based norms.
Those who apply for a disability pension because of musculoskeletal complaints have a low degree of self-appraised health and physical functioning, and there is a paucity of objectively verifiable disease.
