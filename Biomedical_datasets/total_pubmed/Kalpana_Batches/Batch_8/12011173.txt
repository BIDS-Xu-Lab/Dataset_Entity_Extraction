Rhus michauxii, a rare plant species endemic to the southeastern United States, was previously known only from central North Carolina and one site in Georgia.
An additional site, which is now believed to represent the largest known concentration of R. michauxii, was recently discovered at Ft. Pickett near Blackstone, Virginia.
Morphological characteristics in several of the Ft.
Pickett Rhus populations appear to be intermediate between R. michauxii and the widespread R. glabra, a closely related congener that co-occurs at Ft. Pickett.
Although morphological evidence of hybridization between R. michauxii and R. glabra in North Carolina has been provided previously, genetic marker data are lacking.
In the present study we examined levels of allozyme variation at 11 polymorphic loci within and among seven populations of R. michauxii, one population of R. glabra, and four putative hybrid populations at Ft. Pickett.
Overall, R. michauxii had typical levels of within-population genetic variation when compared to other species with similar life-history characteristics.
In contrast, the proportion of genetic variation among populations (G(ST)) was considerably lower than expected.
Finally, R. michauxii and R. glabra appear to have a fixed allelic difference at the Idh2 locus.
This enabled us to confirm hybridization in all four of the putative hybrid populations and one of the R. michauxii populations.
