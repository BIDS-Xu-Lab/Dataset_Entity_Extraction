The objective of this Delphi analysis was to obtain consensus on injection-site reaction (ISR) experience and mitigation strategies for patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis switching from nonpegylated interferons (IFNs) to peginterferon β-1a in the ALLOW Phase IIIb trial using a three-step approach.
Study investigators and coordinators from investigative sites enrolling four or more patients in ALLOW participated in three rounds of questionnaires and interviews.
Respondents (n = 37) agreed that the most common ISR, erythema, was not disruptive to daily activities.
Patient education, as a conversation with a clinician about ISR potential, was recommended.
The consensus of Delphi respondents on ISR experience and ISR management after switching from nonpegylated IFNs to peginterferon β-1a can help inform treatment decisions and manage patient expectations.
