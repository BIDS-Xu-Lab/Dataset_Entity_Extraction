To determine the net direct medical cost of asthma and to investigate factors influencing costs, a case-control study using data from North Carolina Medicaid (May 1996-April 1998) was used.
Comparison subjects were matched 1:1 on age, gender, and race.
Multivariate generalized least-squares models were estimated.
The adjusted net cost of asthma (N = 27,493) was 1250 dollars.
The number of beta-agonist and oral corticosteroid prescriptions was significantly associated with higher costs.
The adjusted net cost of asthma to North Carolina Medicaid is approximately 1250 dollars, and the cost of asthma is influenced by beta-agonist and oral corticosteroid exposure.
