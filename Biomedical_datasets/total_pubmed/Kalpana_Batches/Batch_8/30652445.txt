Parental hypercholesterolemia would be a better predictor of hypercholesterolemia than family medical history in children.
To compare the strength of association and predictive values of parental hypercholesterolemia versus a positive family history in pediatric hypercholesterolemia.
Cholesterol levels were measured in children aged ≥ 6 and < 12 years and in their biological parents.
A survey was administered to parents.
The association was estimated using the odds ratio (OR), and its predictive value was determined.
The relationship between hypercholesterolemia in parents and their children was studied with multilevel regression.
A total of 332 children, 304 mothers, and 206 fathers were assessed.
A cholesterol level ≥ 240 mg/dL in one or both parents and ≥ 200 mg/dL in children showed: OR= 6.40; 95 % confidence interval (CI)= 2.85-14.48; p < 0.0001; sensitivity= 69 %; specihcity= 74 %; positive predictive value (PPV)= 34 %; negative predictive value (NPV)= 93 %; positive likelihood ratio (LR+)= 2.69; negative likelihood ratio (LR-)= 0.42.
Family medical history versus children with cholesterol level ≥ 200 showed: OR= 1.86; 95 % CI= 0.84-4.11; p= 0.1272; sensitivity= 69 %; specihcity= 46 %; PPV= 19 %; NPV= 89 %; LR+= 1.27; LR-= 0.68.
Cholesterol was 2.9 and 2.5 mg/dL higher per every 10 mg/dL of increased cholesterol in mothers and fathers, respectively.
Parental hypercholesterolemia was significantly associated with hypercholesterolemia in children and showed a higher predictive power than a positive family medical history.
