Ischemic stroke is a life-threatening cerebral vascular disease and accounts for high disability and mortality worldwide.
Currently, no efficient therapeutic strategies are available for promoting neurological recovery in clinical practice, except rehabilitation.
The majority of neuroprotective drugs showed positive impact in pre-clinical studies but failed in clinical trials.
Therefore, there is an urgent demand for new promising therapeutic approaches for ischemic stroke treatment.
Emerging evidence suggests that exosomes mediate communication between cells in both physiological and pathological conditions.
Exosomes have received extensive attention for therapy following a stroke, because of their unique characteristics, such as the ability to cross the blood brain-barrier, low immunogenicity, and low toxicity.
An increasing number of studies have demonstrated positively neurorestorative effects of exosome-based therapy, which are largely mediated by the microRNA cargo.
Herein, we review the current knowledge of exosomes, the relationships between exosomes and stroke, and the therapeutic effects of exosome-based treatments in neurovascular remodeling processes after stroke.
Exosomes provide a viable and prospective treatment strategy for ischemic stroke patients.
