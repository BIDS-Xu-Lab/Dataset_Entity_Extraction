To compare thyroid cancer incidence rates and trends between Korean, non-Korean Asian, and non-Hispanic White populations in the United States, and between the US Korean population and the South Korean population.
Population-based analysis of cancer incidence data.
Cases of thyroid cancer diagnosed during 1999-2014 from the Korean Central Cancer Registry (KCCR) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 9 detailed Asian/Pacific Islander subgroup incidence and population dataset were included.
Incidence rates were obtained from the datasets, and annual percent change (APC) of the incidence rates was calculated using Joinpoint regression analysis.
Thyroid cancer incidence rate for 1999-2014 was significantly higher for South Korea (48.05 [95% CI 47.89-48.22] per 100,000 person-years) than for the US Korean population (11.12 [95% CI 10.49-11.78] per 100,000 person-years), which was slightly higher than the Non-Korean Asian population (10.23 [95% CI 10.02-10.43] per 100,000 person-years), and slightly lower than the Non-Hispanic White population (12.78 [95% CI 12.69-12.87] per 100,000 person-years).
Incidence rates in South Korea increased dramatically (average APC 17.9, 95% CI 16.0-19.9), significantly higher than the US Korean population (average APC 5.0, 95% CI 3.1-6.8), which was similar to the non-Korean Asian (average APC 2.5, 95% CI 0.9-4.2) and the non-Hispanic White (average APC 5.1, 95% CI 4.7-5.6) populations.
South Korea's high thyroid cancer incidence rates cannot be attributed to genetic factors, but are likely due to health care system factors.
