Many aspects of medical care can now be delivered at a distance using telemedicine technology.
Rapid video and computer-based communication of medical information makes it possible for a physician to "examine" a patient located in another city, to view highly detailed medical images, to consult with distant subspecialists, or to supervise complex medical procedures.
This same technology can bring scattered health-care workers together for joint teaching conferences.
The Yale Telemedicine Center has initiated a number of such programs ranging from providing consultations in real time to physicians in Saudi Arabia, to interpreting medical images across town or across the state.
Telemedicine will become a powerful tool for managed health-care organizations which are responsible for the medical needs of widely distributed patients in a vertically integrated health-care delivery system.
This paper reviews the evolution of telemedicine, its technical fundamentals, specific medical applications, and the activities of the Yale Telemedicine Center.
Evolving uses for telemedicine in Connecticut are described.
