Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) remains the cornerstone for osteoporosis evaluation in Thalassemia major.
However, several drawbacks have been observed in this unique setting.
We sought to determine the correlation between quantitative CT (QCT) and DXA-derived parameters; secondarily, we aimed to investigate the role of the two techniques in predicting the risk of fracture.
We retrospectively included patients with β-thalassemia major who had undergone both lumbar and femoral DXA examinations, and CT scans including the lumbar spine, performed for disparate diagnostic issues, within 4 months from the DXA.
CT data were examined employing a phantom-less QCT method for bone mineral density (BMD) assessment.
We also retrieved any spontaneous or fragility fractures occurring from 1 year before up to 5 years after the date of DXA scans.
QCT measures were significantly higher than those determined by DXA.
The gap between QCT and DXA values was strongly associated with patient age.
The most powerful predictive variable for risk of fracture was the ACR classification based on volumetric BMD obtained by QCT.
DXA provided more negative measures than those determined by QCT.
However, QCT seemed to evaluate thalassaemic osteopathy better than DXA, since volumetric BMD was a stronger predictor of fracture.
