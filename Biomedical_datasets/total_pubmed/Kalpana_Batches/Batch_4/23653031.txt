Arthroscopic suture fixation of tibial eminence fractures using FiberWire is a favorable therapeutic option.
The application of biodegradable material may be of advantage especially during childhood.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical properties using the biodegradable suture materials PDS II and Vicryl compared with FiberWire.
Bone mineral density was evaluated by pqCT in 18 human knee specimens and 3 similar groups were formed.
A standardized anterior tibial eminence fracture was created and suture fixation was performed using each suture material (PDS II, Vicryl, FiberWire) in 6 specimens.
Cyclic testing and destructive loading to failure was conducted.
Both testing modalities showed PDS II to be inferior to the other evaluated suture materials.
Although significantly higher failure loads were seen with FiberWire sutures, Vicryl yielded comparable stiffness in load-to-failure testing.
No significant differences between Vicryl and FiberWire could be observed under nondestructive cyclic conditions.
Even though FiberWire yields a superior ultimate failure load, Vicryl presented comparable results under cyclic conditions.
For tibial eminence fractures in children, Vicryl should be considered as an alternative biodegradable suture material.
The use of PDS II cannot be advocated.
