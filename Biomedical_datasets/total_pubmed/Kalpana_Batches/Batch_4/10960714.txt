Our aim was to determine the prevalence of the intestinal bacteria: Lawsonia intracellularis, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, Serpulina intermedia, Brachyspira innocens, Brachyspira pilosicoli, pathogenic Escherichia coli (serogroups O138, O139, O141 and O149) and Salmonella enterica in Danish finishing pig herds.
A total of 79 herds was randomly selected and visited during 1998.
From each herd, 20 faecal samples were collected from individual pigs weighing 30-50kg.
Furthermore, 10 pooled pen samples were collected and examined for S. enterica.
In total, 1580 faecal samples and 790 pen samples were collected and examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture.
L. intracellularis was found in 74 herds (93.7%), B. hyodysenteriae in two herds (2.5%), S. intermedia in 10 herds (12. 7%), B. innocens in 27 herds (34.2%), B. pilosicoli in 15 herds (19. 0%), pathogenic E. coli in 19 herds (24.1%) and S. enterica in eight herds (10.1%).
The within-herd prevalences of L. intracellularis and B. hyodysenteriae were 25-30%; the within-herd prevalences of the other agents were 5-10%.
Three herds (4%) were not infected with any of the bacteria and 25 herds (32%) were only infected with L. intracellularis.
