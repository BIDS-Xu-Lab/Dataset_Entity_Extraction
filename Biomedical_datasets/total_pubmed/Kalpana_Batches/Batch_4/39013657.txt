Anatomical models have key applications in radiotherapy, notably to help understand the relationship between radiation dose and risk of developing side effects.
This review analyses whether age-specific computational phantoms, developed from healthy subjects and paediatric cancer patient data, are adequate to model a paediatric population.
The phantoms used in the study were International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), 4D extended cardiac torso (XCAT) and Radiotherapy Paediatric Atlas (RT-PAL), which were also compared to literature data.
Organ volume data for 19 organs was collected for all phantoms and literature.
ICRP was treated as the reference for comparison, and percentage difference (P.D) for the other phantoms were calculated relative to ICRP.
Overall comparisons were made for each age category (1, 5, 10, 15) and each organ.
Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel (version 16.59).
The smallest P.D to ICRP was for Literature (-17.4%), closely followed by XCAT (26.6%).
The largest was for RT-PAL (88.1%).
The rectum had the largest average P.D (1,049.2%) and the large bowel had the smallest (2.0%).
The P.D was 122.6% at age 1 but this decreased to 43.5% by age 15.
Linear regression analysis showed a correlation between organ volume and age to be the strongest for ICRP (R2 = 0.943) and weakest for XCAT (R2 = 0.676).
The phantoms are similar enough to ICRP for potential use in modelling paediatric populations.
ICRP and XCAT could be used to model a healthy population, whereas RT-PAL could be used for a population undergoing/after radiotherapy.
