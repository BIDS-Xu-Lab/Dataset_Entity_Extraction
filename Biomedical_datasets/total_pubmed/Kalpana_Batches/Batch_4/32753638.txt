Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) develop systemic physiological changes that could increase the risk of severe evolution of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and result in atypical clinical features of COVID-19 with possible delay in both diagnosis and treatment.
We evaluated differences in clinical features and evolution of COVID-19 between people with SCI and able-bodied individuals.
The study was conducted in an Italian inpatient rehabilitation referral center for individuals with SCI during the lockdown for the COVID-19 pandemic.
We compared clinical information between patients with SCI and able-bodied healthcare workers of the same center who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction.
Overall, 15 out of the 25 SCI patients admitted to the center and 17 out of the 69 healthcare workers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
Patients with SCI exhibited a significantly more advanced age and a higher prevalence of comorbidities.
Nevertheless, no significant differences in clinical expression of COVID-19 and treatment strategies were observed between the two groups.
All hospitalized subjects were treated in nonintensive care units and no deaths occurred in either group.
This study does not support the supposed notion that COVID-19 could exhibit atypical clinical features or a worse evolution in the frail population of people with SCI.
