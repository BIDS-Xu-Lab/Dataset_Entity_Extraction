Inhaled dust in the environment can trigger specific reactions in the airways and cause various respiratory diseases.
Evaluate the lung function and functional capacity of foundry workers who are exposed to metals and use effective control measures.
A cross-sectional study was realized with 108 workers at a bronze foundry and machining plant and in maintenance at a private university, both in Brazil.
The workers were divided into two groups: the study group exposed to metals but using risk control measues and a control group not exposed to metal work.
The Medical Research Council Questionnaire on Respiratory Symptoms and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire were administered, and lung function and functional capacity were evaluated.
Comparative statistics were used to identify differences in the outcome measures between the two groups.
The groups had similar personal and anthropometric characteristics and time on the job.
Spirometry and peak expiratory flow presented no significant differences between the groups.
And there was also no statistically significant difference between groups in functional capacity as assessed by performance on the six-minute walk test.
Foundry industry workers in Brazil who were exposed to metal but used risk control measures had similar lung function and functional capacity when compared to the control group who were not exposed to metal.
This is a positive results and maybe related to age, time exposure and control of occupational hazards.
However, these workers need to continue being monitored in longitudinal studies.
