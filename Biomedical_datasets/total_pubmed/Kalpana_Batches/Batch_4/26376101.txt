The primary goal of reconstructive and revision surgery is to restore, repair, rebuild, and support damaged, weakened, or absent tissue.
There are numerous approaches for soft tissue support and repair, including the use of autologous tissue, human- or animal-derived acellular dermal matrices, absorbable or permanent synthetic mesh, and, now, a new class of bioresorbable protein scaffold.
Although many factors influence the choice of surgical approach and the specific product used for soft tissue support and repair, the goal is to improve long-term outcomes while minimizing complications and recurrences requiring further revisional surgery.
In this review, the basic science, clinical characteristics, and clinical applications of SERI(Â®) Surgical Scaffold, a novel, engineered, highly purified silk product for soft tissue support and repair will be presented.
