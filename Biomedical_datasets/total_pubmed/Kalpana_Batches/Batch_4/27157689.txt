The aims of this longitudinal study were to investigate a significant threshold shift (STS) among personnel working on board the Royal Norwegian Navy's (RNoN) vessels between 2012 and 2014 and to identify possible determinants of STS.
Hearing thresholds were measured by pure tone audiometry in two consecutive examinations (n = 226).
STS was defined as an average change in hearing thresholds â‰¥ + 10 dB at 2,000 Hz, 3,000 Hz, and 4,000 Hz in either ear.
Determinants of STS were assessed through a questionnaire.
The incidence of STS was 23.0%.
Significant determinants of STS were the number of episodes of temporary threshold shifts (TTS) in the Navy, exposure to continuous loud noise during work on board, and the number of gun shots (in the Navy, hunting, and sports).
This study indicated a significant association between noise exposure on board Navy vessels and development of STS.
