Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a public health problem.
In Spain, although the prevalence of IPV is greater in immigrant women than in Spanish-born women, immigrant women seem to access services to a lesser extent.
This study aimed to explore and compare perceptions of barriers to and strategies for seeking formal help among Spanish-born and immigrant women IPV survivors.
A qualitative study was conducted based on three focus groups with women of Spanish (n = 9), Romanian (n = 4), and Latin American (n = 4) origin.
The thematic analysis was supported by Atlas.ti.
Three categories and 12 subcategories were identified: general characteristics of help-seeking behavior (e.g., children as the main motivating factor), barriers (e.g., immigrant status, fear of the perpetrator), and strategies for accessing services (e.g., increasing education).
Differences in help-seeking behavior were found between groups.
Relevant information for professionals to improve women's access to IPV support services is provided.
