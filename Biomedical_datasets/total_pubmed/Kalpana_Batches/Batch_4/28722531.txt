Several registries and centers have reported the results of renal biopsies from different parts of the world.
As there are few data regarding the epidemiology of glomerulonephritis (GN) in South Korea, we conducted this study on renal biopsy findings during the last 20 years from a single center.
Data for 818 patients who underwent renal biopsy at our center between 1992 and 2011 were collected retrospectively.
All kidney specimens were examined with light microscopy (LM) and immunofluorescent microscopy (IF).
There were 818 cases of native kidney biopsies.
In cases of primary GN, the most frequent type of renal pathology in adults (18-59 years) was mesangial proliferative GN (MsPGN, 34.5%) followed by IgA nephropathy (IgAN, 33.3%) and membranous GN (MGN, 8.8%).
Indications in adults (18-59 years) were asymptomatic urinary abnormalities (75.3%) followed by nephrotic syndrome (19.8%) and acute kidney injury (AKI, 3.4%).
Among 818 renal biopsy specimens, MsPGN and IgAN were the most frequent biopsy-proven renal diseases.
MGN was the third most common cause of primary GN and lupus nephritis (LN) was the most common secondary glomerular disease.
Our data contribute to the epidemiology of renal disease in South Korea.
