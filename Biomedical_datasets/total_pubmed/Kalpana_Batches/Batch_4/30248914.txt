Traffic sign detection and recognition plays an important role in expert systems, such as traffic assistance driving systems and automatic driving systems.
It instantly assists drivers or automatic driving systems in detecting and recognizing traffic signs effectively.
In this paper, a novel approach for real-time traffic sign detection and recognition in a real traffic situation was proposed.
First, the images of the road scene were converted to grayscale images, and then we filtered the grayscale images with simplified Gabor wavelets (SGW), where the parameters were optimized.
The edges of the traffic signs were strengthened, which was helpful for the next stage of the process.
Second, we extracted the region of interest using the maximally stable extremal regions algorithm and classified the superclass of traffic signs using the support vector machine (SVM).
Finally, we used convolution neural networks with input by simplified Gabor feature maps, where the parameters were the same as the detection stage, to classify the traffic signs into their subclasses.
The experimental results based on Chinese and German traffic sign databases showed that the proposed method obtained a comparable performance with the state-of-the-art method, and furthermore, the processing efficiency of the whole process of detection and classification was improved and met the real-time processing demands.
