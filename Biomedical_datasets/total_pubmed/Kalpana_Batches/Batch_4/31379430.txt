There is a growing focus in the medical community on de-escalating medical treatments where appropriate; however, specific efforts to reduce medication burden in patients with polypharmacy has largely been targeted toward adult populations.
Polypharmacy increases the risk of adverse drug reactions in children, and that risk may be further increased by the use of off-label drugs.
The paediatric prescribing community should explore pharmacovigilance strategies and deprescription initiatives that prioritize patients with polypharmacy.
Currently, best practices may be extrapolated from the adult literature, including medication review algorithms and patient education tools.
Enhancing access to nonpharmacological modalities to address child and youth mental health may mitigate psychotropic polypharmacy.
The aim of these initiatives should be to improve patient outcomes and experiences by avoiding adverse drug events and drug-drug interactions.
