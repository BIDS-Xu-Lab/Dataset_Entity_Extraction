eConsultation in nephrology is an innovative way for general practitioners (GPs) to consult a nephrologist.
Studies have shown that questions from GPs can be answered and intended referrals can be avoided by eConsultation.
The primary aim of this study was therefore to assess whether patients for whom a referral to the outpatient clinic of a medical specialist was avoided in the short term were not then referred for the same problem within one year after the eConsultation.
All eConsultations sent between June 2017 and April 2018 to seven nephrologists in three different hospitals in The Netherlands were included.
Exclusion criteria were duplications and missing data on follow-up.
Data were obtained from the eConsultation application forms and from GP medical records.
A total of 173 eConsultations were included.
Of the 32 patients for whom a referral was initially prevented, 91% (95% confidence interval 75-98) had not been referred to a specialist for the same problem within one year after the eConsultation.
eConsultation in the field of nephrology can prevent referrals in the long term.
It can therefore contribute to a more modern and efficient health-care system in which chronic care is provided by GPs in close proximity to patients, while specialist support is easily available and accessible through eConsultation when necessary.
