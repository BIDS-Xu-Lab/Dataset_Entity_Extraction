The volatile anaesthetics isoflurane and sevoflurane induce both negative and positive inotropic effects in ventricular myocytes, the mechanisms of which are not fully understood.
Previous data suggest that changes in myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity contribute to their sustained negative inotropic effects.
In this study, the role of changes in myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity in both positive and negative inotropic effects of these agents was examined in intact ventricular myocytes.
C. Myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity was assessed from plots of cell length against fura-2 fluorescence ratio (Fr) from individual twitches at various points before, during and after a 1 or 4 min exposure to 0.6 mM anaesthetic.
Isoflurane reduced mean (sd) myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity from 10.3 (1.9) to 5.9 (1.6) microm Fr(-1) (P<0.001) throughout a 1 min exposure, which returned to control on removal.
In contrast, on initial exposure to sevoflurane, Ca(2+) sensitivity was reduced from 10.8 (1.3) to 4.3 (0.9) microm Fr(-1) (P<0.001) but this recovered partially towards control over 3 min. On removal, sensitivity was increased above control (to 17.7 (2.2) microm Fr(-1); P<0.001) before preanaesthetic levels were restored.
These data show that both isoflurane and sevoflurane reduce apparent myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity at steady state.
However, sevoflurane (but not isoflurane) induced transient changes in apparent myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity, which would contribute to its inotropic profile.
