Universal school health services are expected to offer similar, needs-based services to all students across schools, service providers and students' socio-economic statuses and health needs.
This study investigates access to school health nurses in Finland.
The objectives were to study the differences in access to school health nurse between service providers, schools, students' characteristics and school health nurse resources.
Access was examined through a nationwide School Health Promotion study, which is a self-reporting, voluntary and anonymous survey for 8th and 9th graders (15 to 16-year old, N = 71865).
The ethical committee of the National Institute for Health and Welfare has approved procedure for the School Health Promotion study.
Data on school health nurse resources and service providers were obtained from the national database (534 schools; 144 service providers).
Of the pupils, 15% of girls and 11% of boys reported difficult access to a school health nurse.
The number of adolescents who reported difficult access ranged between service providers (0%-41%) and schools (0%-75%).
Students with lower socio-economic background, poorer well-being at school, lack of support for studying and greater health needs reported difficult access more often.
School health nurse resources were associated with difficult access only among boys, when resources were under the national recommendations.
These findings raise concern about equality and unmet health needs in school health services.
