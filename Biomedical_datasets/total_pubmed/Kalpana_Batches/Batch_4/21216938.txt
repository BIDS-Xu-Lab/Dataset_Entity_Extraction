In this study, the role of hyper-radiation sensitivity (HRS) in potentiating the effects of cisplatin by low-dose fractionated radiation (LDFRT) was evaluated in four human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines.
Gy was assessed using colony-forming and apoptotic assays.
Cell-cycle disturbances were studied by flow cytometry.
Expression of genes involved in apoptosis was assessed using real-time reverse transcriptase PCR arrays.
H-157 cells showed a distinct HRS region, followed by UKY-29 and A549 cells, whereas it was absent in H460 cells, which when lack HRS showed maximum CER with LDFRT (4 Ã— 0.5 Gy) both by clonogenic inhibition and by apoptosis compared with single fraction of 2 Gy whereas the most radioresistant A549 cells had the least CER, with no significant differences between LDFRT or 2 Gy.
Interestingly, in H-157 cells, a more pronounced CER was observed with LDFRT when assessed by apoptosis but clonogenic inhibition-CER was higher with 2 Gy than with LDFRT.
Excluding H-157 cells, the CER by LDFRT was inversely proportional to radioresistance [(determined by D(0), the dose to reduce survival by 67% from any point on the linear portion of the survival curve or surviving fraction (SF) at 2 Gy (SF(2))] of the cells.
LDFRT alone or in combination with cisplatin induced larger number of proapoptotic genes than 2 Gy or cisplatin + 2 Gy in cells showing HRS when compared to H460 cells that lack HRS.
These findings indicate that chemopotentiation by LDFRT is correlated more with the intrinsic radiation sensitivity of the non-small lung cancer cells than the HRS phenomenon whereas the mode of cell killing is both through apoptosis and clonogenic inhibition.
