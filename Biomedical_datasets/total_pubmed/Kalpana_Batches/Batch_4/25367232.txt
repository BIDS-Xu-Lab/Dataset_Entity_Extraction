The left ventricle (LV) of the heart is composed of a complex organization of cardiac muscle fibers, which contract to generate force and pump blood into the body.
It has been shown that both the orientation and contractile strength of these myofibers vary across the ventricular wall.
The hypothesis of the current study is that the transmural distributions of myofiber orientation and contractile strength interdependently impact LV pump function.
In order to quantify these interactions a finite element (FE) model of the LV was generated, which incorporated transmural variations.
The influences of myofiber orientation and contractile strength on the Starling relationship and the end-systolic (ES) apex twist of the LV were assessed.
The results suggest that reductions in contractile strength within a specific transmural layer amplified the effects of altered myofiber orientation in the same layer, causing greater changes in stroke volume (SV).
Furthermore, when the epicardial myofibers contracted the strongest, the twist of the LV apex was greatest, regardless of myofiber orientation.
These results demonstrate the important role of transmural distribution of myocardial contractile strength and its interplay with myofiber orientation.
The coupling between these two physiologic parameters could play a critical role in the progression of heart failure.
