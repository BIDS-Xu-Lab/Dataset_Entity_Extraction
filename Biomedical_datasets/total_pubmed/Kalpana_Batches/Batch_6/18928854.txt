[3M ESPE AG, Seefeld, Germany]) by means of direct digital radiography.
Six specimens, 5 mm in diameter and 1 mm high, were performed for each material tested.
After the material set, radiographs were made by using a digital sensor and a graduated aluminum stepwedge varying in thickness from 1 to 14 mm.
These samples were tested according to the international standards to compare their radiodensity to that of the aluminum stepwedge.
Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and Tukey tests.
The millimeters of aluminum values reported in this study were 10.41, 8.20, 6.50, 4.90, and 3.09 for AH Plus, Epiphany, Diaket, GuttaFlow, and Adseal, respectively.
Although the materials evaluated had different radiopacities, all of them showed radiopacity above the minimum recommended by the International Organization for Standardization and the American National Standards/American Dental Association.
