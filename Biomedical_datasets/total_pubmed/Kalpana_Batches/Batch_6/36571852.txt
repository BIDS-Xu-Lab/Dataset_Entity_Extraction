The study explored the effects of two combined training (Strength-Proprioceptive versus Cognitive-Balance) programs on postural balance during single-task and dual-task conditions in children with intellectual disability.
The postural balance and the second cognitive-task performances were evaluated before and after 8-week of training in two groups: Strength-Proprioceptive Group (n = 12) and Cognitive-Balance Group (n = 10).
Results showed that, in both groups and regardless of the training effect, the postural balance performance was significantly (p < 0.05) altered in the dual-task condition compared to the single-task one.
After-training session, postural balance performance was improved significantly (p < 0.001) for all task conditions.
After training session, the second cognitive-task performance was improved in the Strength-Proprioceptive Group (p < 0.001) and Cognitive-Balance Groupe (p < 0.05).
In conclusion, the combined training programs, Strength-Proprioceptive and Cognitive-Balance, improved postural balance performance in single-task and dual-task conditions in children with intellectual disability.
