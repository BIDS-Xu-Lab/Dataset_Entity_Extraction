In many studies, oxidative stress markers have been employed to serve as a measure of a disease process or to reflect oxidative status.
These oxidative stress markers must have some degree of predictive validity, but full substantiation of this relation is still lacking.
This paper presents data on levels of three biomarkers, oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDL), carbonyl, and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and a number of life style factors associated with oxidative stress in healthy adults.
For 237 healthy adults aged 40-60 years, a number of life style factors, biochemical characteristics and oxidative status were evaluated.
Markers of oxidative stress were measured by an ELISA method.
Waist-hip ratio and use of vitamin supplement were associated with serum oxidized LDL (P<0.05).
Body mass index and stress had a relationship (P<0.05) with protein carbonyl.
Creactive protein was related to serum oxidized LDL (P<0.01).
There was no correlation among three oxidative stress markers, oxidized LDL, carbonyl, and 8-OHdG.
The oxidative stress markers used in this study could not be regarded as a general estimate of the healthy individual oxidative status.
Further studies focusing on the development of biomarkers to reflect changes in the oxidative status under normal, non-pathological conditions in humans will be required.
