This paper describes how Bayesian networks can be used in combination with compartmental models to plan recombinant human erythropoietin delivery in the treatment of anemia of chronic uremic patients.
Past measurements of hemoglobin concentration in a patient during the therapy can be exploited to adjust the parameters of a compartmental model of erythropoiesis.
This adaptive process provides more accurate patient-specific predictions, and hence a more rational dosage planning.
Inferences are performed by using a stochastic simulation algorithm called Gibbs sampling.
We describe a drug delivery optimization protocol based on our approach.
Some results obtained on real data are presented.
