100 consecutive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were reviewed independently by two radiologists.
Patients were selected so that the anatomical areas of clinical interest coincided with the special interests of the reviewers.
The reviewers were both consultant radiologists, one with 3 years' and the other with 6 years' experience of MRI.
Hard copy images from the MRI examinations were reported independently by both reviewers.
Of the 100 MRI examinations, there was full concordance of opinion in 61/100.
Of the remaining 39 cases, four (10%) were considered "minor unrelated" differences, 12 (31%) "minor related" differences and 23 (59%) "major related" differences resulting in a significant change in patient management.
