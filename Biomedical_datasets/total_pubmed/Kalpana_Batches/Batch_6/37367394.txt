It is common for a cardiac mass to be discovered accidentally during an echocardiographic examination.
Following the relief of a cardiac mass, being able to evaluate and characterize it using non-invasive imaging methods is critical.
Echocardiography, computed tomography (CT), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), and positron emission tomography (PET) are the main imaging modalities used to evaluate cardiac masses.
Although multimodal imaging often allows for a better assessment, CMR is the best technique for the non-invasive characterization of tissues, as the different MR sequences help in the diagnosis of cardiac masses.
This article provides detailed descriptions of each CMR sequence employed in the evaluation of cardiac masses, underlining the potential information it can provide.
The description in the individual sequences provides useful guidance to the radiologist in performing the examination.
