To evaluate the influence on bond strength and interface quality of different canal drying protocols in roots filled with Bio-C Sealer.
Ninety-six roots of upper canines were prepared with R50 file and irrigated with 2.5% NaOCl and 17% EDTA under ultrasonic agitation.
Roots were divided according to the drying protocol: Dry -White Mac tip for 5 s, followed by aspiration with a capillary tip for 5 s and paper points; Slightly moist -White Mac tip followed by capillary aspiration without paper points; Wet -White Mac tip followed by a single paper point.
The roots were filled with Bio-C Sealer (BCS) or AH Plus (AHP) (n = 16) and sectioned for the push-out test after 3 months.
Failure modes were assessed and the interface morphology was analyzed under SEM.
After 6 months, the other half of roots were evaluated.
Data were analyzed by ANOVA/Tukey test at 5%.
Chi-square test were used in the failure analysis and Kruskal-Wallis/Dwass-Steel-Critchlow-Fligner for interface analysis.
The AHP-filled roots had the highest bond strength when the canal was dried (P < .05).
No difference was found for periods (P > .05).
For BCS, the highest bond strength was found in the slightly moist canals (P < .05).
A predominance of adhesive failures was observed.
The dried canals filled with AHP had the highest percentage of good adaptation, while BCS had no difference.
The best drying protocol for AH Plus is using the White Mac tip, followed by the capillary tip aspiration and paper points until complete dryness; and for Bio-C Sealer is using the White Mac tip, followed by capillary aspiration without paper points.
