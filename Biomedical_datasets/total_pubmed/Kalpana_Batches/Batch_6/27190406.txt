National AIDS Control Organization guidelines on enhanced syndromic case management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and reproductive tract infections (RTIs) require per speculum (P/S) and per vaginal (P/V) examinations for diagnosis of STIs.
However, it is not known if the addition of P/S and P/V examinations to self-reported symptomatic assessment adds any value for the diagnosis of STI/RTI.
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of P/S and P/V examinations compared with self-reported symptomatic assessment in a cohort of female sex workers (FSWs).
We performed a cross-sectional study from August 2009 to June 2010, among 519 FSWs in Surat city, Gujarat, India.
Symptomatic assessment for the presence or absence of vaginal/cervical discharge (VCD) or lower abdominal pain (LAP) was done using a self-administered questionnaire.
After completion of the questionnaire, all participants underwent P/S and P/V examinations.
Summary diagnostic accuracy measures were calculated.
Five hundred and nineteen FSWs between the ages of 18-49 years participated in the study.
The median age of participants was 31 years.
The prevalence of VCD and LAP syndromes based on vaginal discharge, LAP, or both was 56%, 5,-10%, respectively.
The sensitivity of P/S and P/V examinations depending on symptomatic assessment ranged from 47% to 76%.
The specificity ranged from 73% to 93%.
The positive predictive value ranged from 25% to 83%, and the negative predictive value ranged from 56% to 98%.
Symptomatic assessment alone is not adequate for the diagnosis of VCD and LAP syndromes and can lead to a significant number of missed cases (36%).
A P/S and P/V examinations is critical for assessment of VCD and LAP syndromes and subsequent treatment.
