Management of benign prostatic hyperplasia focuses on relief of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs), improvement of quality of life, and prevention of symptom progression.
Minimally invasive surgical treatments (MISTs) offer potential for rapid symptomatic relief, medication independence, and less perioperative risk.
The Rezūm system is a novel MIST that uses water vapor thermal therapy to ablate obstructive prostate tissue.
In this review, we summarize the data revealing that water vapor thermal therapy provides clinically meaningful, rapid, and durable relief of LUTSs in both storage and voiding functions while providing a minimal impact on sexual function.
The expanding body of literature examining Rezūm water vapor thermal therapy suggests that it is a safe, efficacious, and durable treatment modality for lower urinary tract symptoms that can be offered to a wide selection of patients.
