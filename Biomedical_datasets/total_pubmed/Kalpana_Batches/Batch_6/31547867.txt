Recent studies suggested that miR-17~106 family was involved in the regulation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs).
However, distinct function of each family member was reported in regulating stem cells within and without the brain.
Hence, to investigate the roles of individual miRNAs in miR-17~106 family and mechanisms underlying their effects on neurogenesis is important to extend our understanding in the CNS development.
Here, we examined the influence of miR-106a/b on the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of embryonic NPCs using specific mimics and inhibitor.
The targets of miR-106a/b were identified from miRNA target prediction database and confirmed by luciferase assay.
Specific siRNAs were utilized to erase the effects of miR-106a/b on the expression levels of target genes.
A positive correlation was observed between the temporal reduction of miR-106a/b expression levels and the decline of NPC pools in vivo and in vitro.
The perturbation of miR-106's function approaches revealed that miR-106b, but not miR-106a, facilitated the maintenance of NPCs and repressed the generation of both neuronal and glial cells, without preference to a particular lineage.
No effect was observed for miR-106a/b in NPCs' survival.
The influence of miR-106b on NPCs' proliferation and differentiation is likely achieved by directly inhibiting the expression of Tp53inp1 and Cdkn1a, key components of Tp53inp1-Tp53-Cdkn1a axis.
Our study demonstrated a novel axis, miR-106b-Tp53inp1-Tp53-Cdkn1a, in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of NPCs.
