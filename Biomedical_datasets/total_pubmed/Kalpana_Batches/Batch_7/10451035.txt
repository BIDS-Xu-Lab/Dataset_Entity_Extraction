A vascular renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is present in the forearm vasculature of essential hypertensive patients and is closely related to the circulating renin profile.
To test whether the haemodynamic effect of acute intrabrachial administration of captopril is related to the circulating and/or vascular RAS, 31 hypertensive patients were selected and divided into four groups according to their different circulating RAS profile (n = 7 hypertensive patients with primary aldosteronism and suppressed plasma renin activity; n = 7 low renin essential hypertensive patients; n = 8 normal renin essential hypertensive patients; n = 9 high renin renovascular hypertensive patients).
The forearm net balance of active renin, plasma renin activity and angiotensin II, obtained by intrabrachial infusion of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (0.03, 0.1, 0.3 microg/100 ml/min) and calculated as the product of the venous-arterial plasma concentration gradient and forearm blood flow (FBF), was closely related to the circulating RAS.
Captopril (0.25, 2.5, 25 microg/100 ml/min per 20 min each dose) unchanged basal FBF in the primary aldosteronism and low renin groups (FBF increase: from 3.9 +/- 0.4 to a maximum of 4.1 +/- 0.5 and from 3.8 +/- 0.3 to a maximum of 4.3 +/- 0.5 ml/100 ml/min, respectively), whereas it caused slight vasodilation in the normal renin group (from 3.9 +/- 0.3 to a maximum of 5.3 +/- 0.7 ml/100 ml/min), and pronounced vasodilation in the high renin group (from 4.0 +/- 0.4 to a maximum of 6.4 +/- 0.5 ml/100 ml/min).
Captopril-induced vasodilation showed a significant direct correlation with the circulating and vascular RAS.
The present data, while confirming the existence of a vascular RAS in the forearm of hypertensive patients indicate that the acute vasodilating effect of intrabrachial captopril is linked to a stimulated RAS, either circulating or vascular, supporting the evidence that, in acute conditions, ACE inhibitors exert their vasodilating effect through the RAS blockade.
