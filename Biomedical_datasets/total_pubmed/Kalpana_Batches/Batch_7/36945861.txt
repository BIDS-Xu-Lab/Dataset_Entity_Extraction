As a traditional fermented meat product, dry-cured Xuanwei ham could be a rich source of bioactive peptides.
This study intended to investigate the transepithelial transport and cytoprotection of antioxidant peptides isolated from simulated gastrointestinal digestion of Xuanwei ham.
Through ultrafiltration and gel filtration chromatography after simulated digestion, five new antioxidative cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) with 16-27 amino acid residues were identified, and protective effects of the pretreatment with GHYTEGAELVDSVLDVVRK (GK-19) and TDEFQLHTNVNDGTEFGGSIYQK (TK-23) on H2O2-induced damaged HepG2 cells were investigated.
The results showed that the peptide TK-23 at 0.5 mg mL-1 showed a good antioxidant activity through upregulating the activity of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD and GR) and decreasing the MDA level in H2O2-induced damaged HepG2 cells with a better protective effect compared to GSH.
Our observations of novel antioxidant CPPs with 16-27 amino acid residues could enrich the antioxidative CPP database, and these findings could provide data support for further study of CPPs.
