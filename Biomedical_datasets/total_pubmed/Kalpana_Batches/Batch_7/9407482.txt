This article describes a specialist's perspective on the challenge of caring for patients with Parkinson disease in a changing American health care environment that places increasing responsibility on primary care physicians.
Guidelines were developed by drawing from a combination of personal experience at a large university Parkinson disease clinic, literature review, presentations at various family practice continuing medical education conferences, and involvement as investigator in various clinical trials of drugs used in Parkinson disease treatment.
From a therapeutic standpoint, Parkinson disease can be divided into three stages--early, nonfluctuating, and fluctuating.
Although the same drugs, namely, carbidopa-levodopa preparations, dopamine agonists, and anticholinergic medications, are usually prescribed, their pattern of use, including frequency and dosing, varies depending on the nature of the dominant symptoms and stage of the disease.
Management of Parkinson disease requires familiarity with both the disease-related and drug-related components.
Optimal functional efficiency for the patient is gained through striking a delicate balance between the drug regimen and the disease-related components.
