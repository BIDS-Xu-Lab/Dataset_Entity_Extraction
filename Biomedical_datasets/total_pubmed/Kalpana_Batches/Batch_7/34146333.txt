The distinct biophysical and pharmaceutical properties of camelid single-domain antibodies, referred to as VHHs or nanobodies, are associated with their nanometric dimensions, elevated stability, and antigen recognition capacity.
These biomolecules can circumvent a number of diagnostic system limitations, especially those related to the size and stability of conventional immunoglobulins currently used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and point-of-care, electrochemical, and imaging assays.
In these formats, VHHs are directionally conjugated to different molecules, such as metallic nanoparticles, small peptides, and radioisotopes, which demonstrates their comprehensive versatility.
Thus, the application of VHHs in diagnostic systems range from the identification of cancer cells to the detection of degenerative disease biomarkers, viral antigens, bacterial toxins, and insecticides.
The improvements of sensitivity and specificity are among the central benefits resulting from the use of VHHs, which are indispensable parameters for high-quality diagnostics.
Therefore, this review highlights the main biotechnological advances related to camelid single-domain antibodies and their use in in vitro and in vivo diagnostic approaches for human health.
