Infrared thermography can be applied in different medical systems, for example it can be used to catch the images of living blood vessels.
Far infrared rays can be used in a heating machine, which can be applied in the clinical hemodialysis patients.
Infrared electronically sensitized images, which are generated by near-infrared Charge-coupled Device (CCD), are used to detect blood vessels, and used as a long-wavelength external stimulating therapeutic tissue repair system.
When an infrared sensor detection and actuator treatment is applied during hemodialysis, a missing needle can be detected, and far infrared rays have a therapeutic effect on blood vessels.
Because a far-infrared actuated light source can improve blood circulation, it is currently used to prevent fistula embolism in hemodialysis (HD) patients and reduce vascular occlusion after hemodialysis.
Sensors used for sudden changes in heart rate variability (HRV) are used as predictive and evaluation indicators for our new method.
Far-infrared actuated radiation can increase sympathetic nerve activity and regulation of parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves.
We performed baseline measurements of the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio of autonomic nerve activity before hemodialysis (low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), LF/HF, before HD) and after hemodialysis (LF/HF, after-HD).
Based on data from the HRV continuity tracking report, 35 patients with autonomic nerve activation were treated and evaluated.
We have demonstrated that the resulting near-infrared (NIR) sensor imaging and far-infrared actuator illumination can be used for the detection and treatment of hemodialysis patients.
