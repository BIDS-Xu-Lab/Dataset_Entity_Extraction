Meat products such as burgers contain large amounts of saturated fat and are considered unhealthy foods by a society that is increasingly aware of the impact of food on their health, as there is a widespread idea that the consumption of large amounts of saturated fats is related to cardiovascular diseases, some types of cancer and obesity.
The main goal of this study was to reformulate deer burgers by replacing the saturated fat from its composition with emulsions of oil extracted from melon and pumpkin seeds.
Three emulsions were made with these oils (guar gum and inulin, sodium alginate and maltodextrin) to obtain a solid texture.
Then, burgers were elaborated, using the vegetable oil emulsions to replace partially (50%) or totally (100%) the animal fat usually used in their elaboration.
Physical parameters such as color and texture, consumer evaluation, proximate analysis and the fatty acid composition obtained by gas chromatography were analyzed.
The burgers made with emulsified oils showed a higher weight loss, but with a minor loss of caliber and hardness (p < 0.05).
From the sensory point of view, the reformulated burgers were positively valued by consumer judges when external aspect, odor, flavor and texture were evaluated.
Furthermore, the addition of oil emulsions results in a lower fat content and in an increment of the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids, especially linoleic acid (p < 0.05).
The inclusion of emulsified melon and pumpkin oil in deer burgers leads to an increase in the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids in burgers that, although they showed small differences in texture attributes (especially hardness and cohesiveness), were well valued by consumer judges in all sensory attributes evaluated.
