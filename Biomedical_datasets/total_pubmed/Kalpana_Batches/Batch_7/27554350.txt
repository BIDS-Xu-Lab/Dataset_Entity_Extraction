Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) gene single nucleotide polymorphism (rs5742612) has been associated with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) in several studies with limited sample size and inconsistent outcomes.
So we perform this meta-analysis to assess the precise association between IGF1 gene single nucleotide polymorphism (rs5742612) and AIS.
We systematically searched Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library up to January 19, 2016 to obtain relevant studies using our research strategy.
Four articles all belonging to case-control studies were included in our meta-analysis.
A total of four studies containing 763 cases and 559 controls satisfied the inclusion criteria after judgment by two reviewers.
No significant associations were detected between IGF1 gene single nucleotide polymorphism (rs5742612) and AIS (T vs. C, OR = 1.10, 95 % CI 0.91-1.34, p = 0.32; TT vs. CC: OR = 1.28, 95 % CI 0.82-2.02, p = 0.28; TC vs. CC: OR = 1.29, 95 % CI 0.82-2.06, p = 0.27; TT/TC vs. CC: OR = 1.28, 95 % CI 0.83-1.98, p = 0.27; TT vs.
IGF1 gene single nucleotide polymorphism (rs5742612) is not significant associated with susceptibility to AIS in either Asian or Caucasian populations.
However, IGF1 gene rs5742612 may be associated with severity of AIS.
Further studies with larger sample size and different population groups involving the relationship are required to confirm the potential association.
