A survey presents the technical conditions and facilities of the computed tomographic virtual endoscopy.
The inner surface of the upper airway was reconstructed from the data set of a helical CT.
The anatomical structures were visualized in over 80 patients.
15 patients with a suspected tracheal stenosis were additional investigated.
The virtual endoscopy allowed an identification of the anatomical structures.
Pathological endoluminal findings, as stenosis, were investigated successfully.
The virtual endoscopy combines the advantages of helical CT and the imaging of the endoluminal surface.
Compared with the endoscopic examination the non-invasive technique offers additional indications, especially in high-risk patients or non-passable Stenosis.
