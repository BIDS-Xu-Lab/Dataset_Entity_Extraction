This article presents parts of a qualitative research of a "case-study" type.
Through free observation, documents research and a non-structured interview the information was gathered.
The purpose of this work was to become aware of the user's understanding of an emergency service, considering the environment and the way he/she was treated.
The group of participants for this matter were in 12 adults in which became inpatients after being examined at the emergency service.
After analysing the data, the result was obtained and divided in the following categories: anything you need, go to the emergency service; that assessment; here everything is done; it isn't pleasant at all; I only have to thank.
