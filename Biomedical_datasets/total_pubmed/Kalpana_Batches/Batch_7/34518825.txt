Numerous studies have documented mental health challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Few studies included pre-pandemic levels of mental health or were comprehensive in assessing factors likely associated with longer-term mental health impacts.
Analyses used prospective data from a subset of participants in the nationwide Cancer Prevention Study-3 (CPS-3) United States cohort (N=2,359; 1,534 women; 825 men) who completed surveys in 2018 and during the COVID-19 pandemic (July-September 2020).
Logistic regressions examined associations of pandemic-related stressors, sociodemographic and other predictors with (i) overall psychological distress (PD) and depression and anxiety separately during the COVID-19 pandemic and (ii) change in PD from 2018 to during the pandemic (low/low; high to low; low to high; high/high).
During the pandemic, 10% of participants reported moderate-to-severe PD and almost half (42%) reported at least mild PD.
Pandemic PD levels were associated with pre-pandemic PD (female OR=5.65; male OR=9.70), financial stressors (female OR=2.48; male OR=3.68), and work/life balance stressors (female OR=3.03; male OR=3.33) experienced since the pandemic began.
These stressors also predicted an escalation from low PD in 2018 to high PD during the pandemic.
Factors associated with high PD at both time points included younger age, female sex, and financial stressors.
These results highlight the importance of regular mental health assessment and support among those with a history of mental health problems and those experiencing pandemic-related stressors, such as those with caregiving responsibilities or job changes.
The American Cancer Society funds the creation, maintenance, and updating of the CPS-3.
