Steroids have been coupled to pyrimidines to give potentially target-specific anti-tumor agents.
We report here on the molecular structures of two such adducts.
The structures of these have been determined by X-ray crystallographic techniques.
The uracil substituent of the former compound is observed to be oriented below the alpha-face in the plane of the steroid skeleton.
In contrast, upon introduction of a 17 alpha-hydroxyl group, as in the latter compound, the base substituent is found to be in a perpendicular orientation bent towards the beta-face of the steroid skeleton.
In the uracil derivative the bases stack between steroid portions of other molecules.
In the thymine adduct this does not occur.
The molecule conformations are correlated with the differences in receptor affinity for these two steroid adducts.
