Elderly patients maintaining functional independence can now be candidates for primary wrist hemiarthroplasty to manage acute irreparable distal radius fractures (DRFs).
However, further investigation with long-term follow-up is required to validate these initial findings.
To review the literature on the outcomes of distal radius hemiarthroplasty with available implants to assess its viability as a treatment option.
A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted using electronic databases, including PubMed, Medline, and Scopus.
The search terms employed were "distal radius fracture" , "hemiarthroplasty" , "wrist arthroplasty" , and related terminology.
The search was restricted to articles published in English from 1980 until June 2023.
Inclusion criteria encompassed cases or case series of DRF treated with hemiarthroplasty, providing clinical or radiographic outcomes, and published in peer-reviewed journals.
A total of 2508 articles from PubMed and 883 from Scopus were identified initially.
Following screening and removal of duplicates, 13 articles met the inclusion criteria.
These articles, predominantly clinical retrospective studies, provided insights into hemiarthroplasty outcomes, including functional improvements and complications.
Hemiarthroplasty was a treatment option for complex DRF, particularly those cases with severe comminution, intraarticular involvement, or severe osteoporosis.
Functional outcomes demonstrated improvements in pain relief, wrist mobility, and grip strength, with variability across studies.
Complications included implant loosening, infection, nerve injury, and stiffness, with varying incidence rates influenced by surgical techniques and implant choice.
Long-term outcomes were inadequately documented, warranting further research.
Hemiarthroplasty is a promising treatment for irreparable DRF in the elderly.
Long-term outcomes and complications require further study.
