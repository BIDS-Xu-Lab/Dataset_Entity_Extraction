While intravenous fluid therapy is essential to re-establishing volume status in children who have experienced trauma, aggressive resuscitation can lead to various complications.
There remains a lack of consensus on whether pediatric trauma patients will benefit from a liberal or restrictive crystalloid resuscitation approach and how to optimally identify and transition between fluid phases.
A panel was comprised of physicians with expertise in pediatric trauma, critical care, and emergency medicine.
A three-round Delphi process was conducted via an online survey, with each round being followed by a live video conference.
Experts agreed or disagreed with each aspect of the proposed fluid management algorithm on a five-level Likert scale.
The group opinion level defined an algorithm parameter's acceptance or rejection with greater than 75% agreement resulting in acceptance and greater than 50% disagreement resulting in rejection.
The remaining were discussed and re-presented in the next round.
Fourteen experts from five Level 1 pediatric trauma centers representing three subspecialties were included.
Responses were received from 13/14 participants (93%).
In round 1, 64% of the parameters were accepted, while the remaining 36% were discussed and re-presented.
In round 2, 90% of the parameters were accepted.
Following round 3, there was 100% acceptance by all the experts on the revised and final version of the algorithm.
We present a validated algorithm for intavenous fluid management in pediatric trauma patients that focuses on the de-escalation of fluids.
Focusing on this time point of fluid therapy will help minimize iatrogenic complications of crystalloid fluids within this patient population.
