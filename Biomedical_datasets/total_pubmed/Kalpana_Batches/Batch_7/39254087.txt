In contrast to pig large airways, the pH of airway surface liquid (ASL) in pig small airways is regulated by CFTR mediated HCO-3 secretion and the vacuolar-type H+ ATPase (V-ATPase) proton secretion.
We hypothesized that in Cystic Fibrosis (CF), the ASL pH of small airways is acidic, and the V-ATPase is internalized.
We quantified proton secretion during the addition of an alkaline test solutions by measuring changes in a pH dependent fluorescent dye generated by porcine small airway epithelia in the absence and presence of bafilomycin A1.
The pH-dependent translocation of V-ATPase in ex vivo and in vivo preparations was measured using immunolocalization of V-ATPase.
We found that bafilomycin sensitive proton secretion stopped when the ASL pH was less than 7.10.
In non-CF pigs and mice, we found that V-ATPase was localized in the apical membrane, and internalized when the lungs were instilled with a pH 6.8 solution.
Studies where we immediately fixed lungs from pigs revealed apical V-ATPase detection in non-CF piglets and less apical detection in CF piglets.
Our data suggest that V-ATPase in small airways is internalized when the ASL pH is acidic.
The decrease in apical localization of V-ATPase in CF pigs is consistent with an acidic ASL pH.
