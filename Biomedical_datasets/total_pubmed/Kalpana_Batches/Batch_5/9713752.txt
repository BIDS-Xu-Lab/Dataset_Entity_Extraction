A methodology used to isolate Escherichia coli O157:H7 from water and survival of this pathogen in inoculated water is described.
[0.05 mg/liter], and cefsulodin [10 mg/liter], and modified hemorrhagic colitis agar (also supplemented with potassium tellurite [2.5 mg/liter]) and cefsulodin [10 mg/liter]).
There were no significant differences (P < 0.05) between the recoveries of E. coli O157:H7 on these two selective media.
Direct plating on these selective agars was used to determine the length of time that E. coli O157:H7 was able to grow, remain viable, and be resistant to the selective agents.
E. coli O157:H7 survived in inoculated water for up to > 300 days, depending on the type of water.
Observation by scanning electron microscopy indicated that E. coli O157:H7 cells attached to, and multiplied on, the container walls.
