Despite their important contribution to the economic domain, active heat-releasing industrial plants have significant implications for human health and climate change.
However, a spatially detailed dataset of various heat-releasing industrial sectors and large-scale characterization of heat emissions from industrial sources have not been reported yet.
In this study, a dataset of heat-releasing industries was established using a national detection map of thermal anomalies produced by a novel and more accurate method employing daily nighttime visible infrared imaging radiometer suite thermal infrared images corresponding to 1 year.
Subsequently, we quantified the dimensional features of heat radiation fluxes of China's industrial plants.
A total of 12â€‰114 industrial objects were structured in a two-level hierarchical dataset of heat-releasing industries, representing a magnitude of at least 1 order higher than the number enumerated in the state-of-the-art inventory of industrial heat sources across China.
The satellite observations helped more completely characterize industrial heat plumes, which represent the industrial heat radiation fluxes with higher levels of densities that prevail in the central-eastern part of China having spatial clustering islands.
Our results could be used to inform policy and environmental management in relation to meaningful dynamic industrial supervision, targeting extreme polluters and differentiated emission mitigation measurements.
