To study the possible hematogenic route of dissemination of Chlamydia trachomatis and to analyze efficacy of methods of pathogen detection in clinical specimens (sera and scraping material).
Cultural method, electron microscopy, real-time PCR, immunofluorescent assay.
C. trachomatis was detected in blood by using 2 tests (culture and PCR) in 95.2% of patients with confirmed Chlamydia infection.
Chlamydia isolated from blood had infectious properties that could point to the presence of weakly studied hematogenic route of dissemination of C. trachomatis in host's organism.
Study of diagnostic value of pathogen detection in serum showed that in case of chronic diseases of urogenital tract as well as extragenital diseases, rate of C. trachomatis detection in serum was significantly higher (61.1% of cases compared to 16.7% in scraping material).
It is the first time when data about possible circulation of C. trachomatis in blood of patients was obtained.
Detection of C. trachomatis in serum of patients with chronic and complicated forms of chlamydiosis provides essentially new approach for direct identification of the pathogen irrespectively from localization of infection's locus.
