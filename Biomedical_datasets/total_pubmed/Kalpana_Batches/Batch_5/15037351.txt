The perceptual stability of an object's color under different illuminants is called color constancy.
We created a neural network to investigate this phenomenon.
The net consisted of one input channel for the background and one for the test object.
Each channel had a set of three (L, M, and S) receptors that were transmitting to three opponent neurons.
The signals from the opponent neurons were passed to hidden neurons, which were connected to the output neurons.
The output signal was generated from the three components of a color vector.
The neural net was trained to identify the color of Munsell samples under various illuminants using the back-propagation algorithm.
Our study investigated the properties of a successfully trained neural network.
Based on the cross-neuron weight analysis, we report that the successfully trained neural net calculates color differences between the test object and the background.
By comparing the human visual system to the neural net, we conclude that to satisfy the color constancy phenomenon, the human visual system has to contain two separate components: one to approximate the background color and the other to estimate the color difference between the object and the background.
