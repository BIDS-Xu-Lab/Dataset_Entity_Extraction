A year earlier, we began the cochlear implant program in our center.
Cochlear implant surgery changed the life of implanted children by enabling integration into the regular education program.
The experience of the Sheba Medical Center is presented in 286 children who were operated on between the years 1990-2005.
Hearing results were examined using questionnaires and designated audiology tests.
Improvement in the hearing ability of implanted children was noted, especially in those who underwent implantations in their first years of life and in those who had previous experience using hearing aids.
Post-operative complications were scanty and similar to those reported in the literature.
The incidence of device failure is decreasing over the years due to production improvement.
The frequency of electronic failure was found to be similar to those described in the literature.
