Significant advances have recently been made in a number of areas concerning central nervous system (CNS) neoplasia.
Particularly salient are the following: (1) gene amplification is related to increasing grade of human glioma malignancy and occurs in approximately 40% of the most common and most malignant variety of glioma, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), (2) by far the most commonly amplified gene in glioblastomas is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene, which is amplified in about one third of GBMs, (3) a small percentage of GBMs amplify N-myc or the novel sequence gli, (4) the EGFR gene is rearranged in at least half of gliomas in which it is amplified, and (5) EGFR gene rearrangement results in external domain deletions that yield truncated EGF receptors.
Antibodies specific for the mutant EGF receptor fusion junction have been successfully produced and provide stimulating new potential avenues for tumor imaging and therapy.
For pediatric CNS neoplasms, only medulloblastoma has been investigated in adequate numbers; a small percentage exhibit amplification of either the N-myc or c-myc genes.
