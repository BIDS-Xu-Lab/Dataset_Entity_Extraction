We here describe a case of congenital leukemia that ended in intrauterine fetal demise at 30 weeks of gestation.
Acute enlargement of the fetal trunk, elevated pulsatility index of the umbilical artery with concomitant decline of pulsatility index of the middle cerebral artery, pleural effusion, and polyhydramnios preceded the fetal death.
Diagnosis of congenital myeloid leukemia was suggested by microscopic examination of the placental tissue, revealing immature myeloid precursors filling the lumina of fetal vessels in the umbilical cord and chorionic villi.
Extensive vascular involvement of the placenta by leukemic cells was considered to be a primary cause of the fetal death.
