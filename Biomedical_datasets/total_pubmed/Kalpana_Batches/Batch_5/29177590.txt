To first evaluate the predictive value of lymph-vascular space invasion (LVSI) and pelvic lymph node metastases (LNM) to parametrial invasion (PI) in patients with early stage cervical cancer.
A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted to identify publications exploring the association between LVSI, LNM, and PI.
The following databases were searched: PubMed/Medline and Web of Science.
Pooling of results was done based on these studies and a diagnostic meta-analysis was performed.
20 articles and a total of 7373 cases were included in the meta-analysis.
17 studies analyzed the correlation between LVSI and PI and 18 studies evaluated the correlation between LNM and PI.
The existence of LVSI accelerated PI with OR being 7.37 (95% CI 5.70-9.54) in fixed-effect model and 7.32 (95% CI 4.65-10.39) in random effects model.
LVSI shows high sensitivity of 0.80 and the AUC was 0.82.
The existence of LNM accelerated PI.
LNM shows the highest specificity of 0.90 and the AUC was 0.77.
Both LVSI and LNM are associated with PI.
Conization and lymphadenectomy might be helpful to predict the parametrial status of patients with early stage cervical cancer.
In addition, the results of this meta-analysis are helpful for designing further prospective clinical trials.
