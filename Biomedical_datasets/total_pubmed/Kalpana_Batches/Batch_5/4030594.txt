After acclimating individually housed male rats to temperatures of either 24.5 +/- 0.1 or 29.2 +/- 0.1 degrees C for 14 days, randomly paired animals from each group were acutely exposed (3 h) in series to experimental temperatures between 18.0 and 34.5 degrees C in a controlled environment room.
Relative humidity of 50 +/- 0.3% and a 12-h light-dark photoperiod (light from 0900 to 2100 h) were maintained.
Metabolic rate (MR) and evaporative water loss (EWL) were-measured using an open-flow system; thermistors were used to measure the rectal (Tre) and tail skin (Tts) temperatures.
MR was relatively constant over a temperature range of 22.2 to 27.0 degrees C for rats acclimated to 24.5 degrees C and 20.0 to 29.2 degrees C for rats acclimated to 29.2 degrees C. Above and below these ranges, MR for both groups was significantly (P less than 0.05) elevated.
At their respective acclimation temperatures, the absolute Tre and Tts of 29.2 degrees C rats were maintained at an elevated level compared with 24.5 degrees C rats.
Although EWL for both groups was relatively constant between 18.0 and 27.0 degrees C, 24.5 degrees C rats displayed higher EWL changes at most environmental temperatures above 27.0 degrees C. At 34.5 degrees C, 29.2 degrees C rats dissipated 26% more metabolic heat by evaporation compared with 24.5 degrees C rats.
These data suggest that acclimation temperatures of rats affected the thermoneutral zone and alter the set-point temperature around which thermal responses are regulated.
