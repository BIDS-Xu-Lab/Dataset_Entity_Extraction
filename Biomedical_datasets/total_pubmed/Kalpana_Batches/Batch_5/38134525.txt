In this article, I reviewed the literature on cross-cultural aging that was published in the last 10 years.
It is intended to be an update of my prior review on aging in culture published in 2013.
In that 2013 review, I proposed that aging processes differed across cultures when (1) individuals in the cultures concerned defined different goals as emotionally meaningful and (2) they increasingly pursued these different goals with age.
Findings in the recent 10 years are generally consistent with this model, but they also suggest nuances and directions for future research.
