Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is used primarily as an opacifier in solid dosage forms and is present in the majority of tablet and capsule dosage forms on the market.
The IQ* TiO2 Working Group has previously shown that titanium dioxide has unique properties which are necessary for its function in these formulations and noted that, as the potential replacements lack the semi-conductor properties, high refractive index and whiteness of E171, it might be hard to replicate these properties with alternative materials.
In this paper we detail the results of readiness surveys and practical assessments that have been conducted with alternative materials by IQ member companies.
A range of technical challenges and regulatory hurdles were identified which mean that, in the short term, it may be difficult to replace titanium dioxide with the currently available alternative materials while readily achieving the same drug product quality attributes, especially for some of the marketed formulations that titanium dioxide is currently used for.
We note the higher technical complexity, due to the variability, color fading and identified scale up risk, of E171 free film coatings and the likely impact on development costs and timelines.
We also highlight several regulatory hurdles that would have to be overcome if a titanium dioxide replacement was required for some markets but was not mandated by others.
