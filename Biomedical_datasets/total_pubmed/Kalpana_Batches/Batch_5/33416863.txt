RNA molecules become attractive small-molecule drug targets to treat disease in recent years.
Computer-aided drug design can be facilitated by detecting the RNA sites that bind small molecules.
However, very limited progress has been reported for the prediction of small molecule-RNA binding sites.
We developed a novel method RNAsite to predict small molecule-RNA binding sites using sequence profile- and structure-based descriptors.
RNAsite was shown to be competitive with the state-of-the-art methods on the experimental structures of two independent test sets.
When predicted structure models were used, RNAsite outperforms other methods by a large margin.
The possibility of improving RNAsite by geometry-based binding pocket detection was investigated.
The influence of RNA structure's flexibility and the conformational changes caused by ligand binding on RNAsite were also discussed.
RNAsite is anticipated to be a useful tool for the design of RNA-targeting small molecule drugs.
