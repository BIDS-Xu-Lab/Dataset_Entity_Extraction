This work presents a novel electromagnetic driving system that consists of eight optimized electromagnets arranged in an optimal configuration and employs a control framework based on an active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) and virtual boundary.
The optimal system configuration enhances the system's compatibility with other ophthalmic surgical instruments, while also improving its capacity to generate magnetic force in the vertical direction.
Besides, the optimal electromagnet parameters provide a superior comprehensive performance on magnetic field generation capacity and thermal power.
Hence, the presented design achieves a stronger capacity for sustained work.
Furthermore, the ADRC controller effectively monitors and further compensates the total disturbance as well as gravity to enhance the system's robustness.
Meanwhile, the implementation of virtual boundaries substantially enhances interactive security via collision avoidance.
The magnetic and thermal performance tests have been performed on the electromagnet to verify the design optimization.
The proposed electromagnet can generate a superior magnetic field of 2.071 mT at a distance of 65 mm with an applied current of 1 A. Moreover, it demonstrates minimal temperature elevation from room temperature (25 °C) to 46 °C through natural heat dissipation in 3 h, thereby effectively supporting prolonged magnetic manipulation of intraocular microsurgery.
Furthermore, trajectory tracking experiments with disturbances have been performed in a liquid environment similar to the practical ophthalmic surgery scenarios, to verify the robustness and security of the presented control framework.
The maximum root mean square (RMS) error of performance tests in different operation modes remains 35.8 μm, providing stable support for intraocular microsurgery.
