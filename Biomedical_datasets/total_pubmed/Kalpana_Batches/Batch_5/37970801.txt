OBJECTIVE: To summarize and describe risk factors for running-related injuries (RRIs) among high school and collegiate cross-country runners.
Four databases (Scopus, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, Cochrane) were searched from inception to August 2023.
Studies assessing RRI risk factors in high school or collegiate runners using a prospective design with at least 1 season of follow-up were included.
Results across each study for a given risk factor were summarized and described.
The NOS and GRADE frameworks were used to evaluate quality of each study and certainty of evidence for each risk factor.
Overall, study quality and certainty of evidence were low to moderate.
Females or runners with prior RRI or increased RED-S (relative energy deficiency in sport) risk factors were most at risk for RRI, as were runners with a quadriceps angle of >20Â° and lower step rates.
Runners with weaker thigh muscle groups had increased risk of anterior knee pain.
Certainty of evidence regarding training, sleep, and specialization was low, but suggests that changes in training volume, poorer sleep, and increased specialization may increase RRI risk.
The strongest predictors of RRI in high school and collegiate cross-country runners were sex and RRI history, which are nonmodifiable.
There was moderate certainty that increased RED-S risk factors increased RRI risk, particularly bone stress injuries.
There was limited evidence that changes in training and sleep quality influenced RRI risk, but these are modifiable factors that should be studied further in this population.
