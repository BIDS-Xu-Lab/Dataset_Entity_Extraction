Existent profiles of Medical Marijuana Program (MMP) participants indicate common and co-morbid chronic diseases, yet evidence on disability or functioning as well as comparisons with general populations are largely lacking.
This study compared health, substance use, and functioning status among formally approved MMP participants with the general adult population in Ontario (Canada).
A community-recruited sample (n = 53) of MMP participants was compared to a sub-sample (n = 510) of the representative Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) Monitor (2015 cycle) survey of Ontario general population adults (ages 18+) based on identical telephone-based interviews regarding substance use, health, and functioning measures.
Means and standard deviations for all indicators were computed by sex, controlled for age and education, and compared by regression techniques.
MMP participants were more likely to be male, younger, and less socio-economically integrated; they indicated more common psychoactive substance (e.g., tobacco, daily cannabis) and psychotropic medication use, as well as overall worse physical and mental health and functioning status.
Marked differences between MMP participants and general population adults were observed.
MMPs appear to attract individuals with complex chronic health problems; however, little is known about the impact of MMP participation on these.
