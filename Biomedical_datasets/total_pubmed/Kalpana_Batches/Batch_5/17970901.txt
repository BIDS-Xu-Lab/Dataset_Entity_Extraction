To inform rural physiotherapy recruitment and retention strategies by describing physiotherapists in the Shepparton region: reasons for career choice, education and physiotherapy professional issues.
Eighty four physiotherapists (79 practicing and 5 non-practicing; 80% female) clustered in main regional centres responded.
Two-thirds worked part-time with most in the public sector (70%), with one third holding more than one position.
One-third considered themselves generalists and one-third specialists.
Physiotherapy was first career choice for 83% who made this decision between 14 and 19 years old (16.8-2.5 years) because of contact with a physiotherapist.
Professional issues challenging physiotherapists in a rural location are compounded by lack of career path, professional support, access to professional development and postgraduate education.
Additional issues are the costs and time to attend courses and conferences, travel/distance, and inadequate resources.
Positive elements of rural practice were part-time employment opportunities, independence as primary health providers, practice variety and community recognition.
Rural physiotherapy recruitment and retention strategies must address resource shortcomings by developing career paths, access to postgraduate education and support.
Enhancing workforce capacity could enable more students to have meaningful rural experience to assist recruitment.
Strategies highlighting existing positive features of rural practice, reinforced with tangible rewards and recognition of physiotherapists' contribution to the health care of Australians are recommended.
