Environmental disinfection is essential for reducing spread of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs).
Previous studies report conflicting results regarding the effects of ultraviolet (UV) light in reducing infections.
This trial evaluated the impact of adding pulsed-xenon UV (PX-UV) to standard terminal cleaning in reducing environmentally implicated HAIs (eiHAIs).
The Lowering the Acquisition of MDROs with Pulsed-xenon (LAMP) trial was conducted in 2 hospitals (15 inpatient wards) utilizing a cluster-randomized, controlled, double-blinded, interventional crossover trial comparing standard terminal cleaning followed by either PX-UV (intervention arm) or sham (control arm) disinfection.
The primary outcome was incidence of eiHAIs from clinical microbiology tests on the fourth day of stay or later or within 3 days after discharge from the study unit.
EiHAIs included clinical cultures positive for vancomycin-resistant enterococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumonia, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii, and stool polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for Clostridiodes difficile.
Between 18 May 2017 and 7 January 2020, 25 732 patients were included, with an incidence of 601 eiHAIs and 180 954 patient-days.
There was no difference in the rate of eiHAIs in the intervention and sham arms (3.49 vs 3.17 infections/1000 patient-days, respectively; RR, 1.10; 95% CI, .94-1.29; P = .23).
Study results were similar when stratified by eiHAI type, hospital, and unit type.
The LAMP study failed to demonstrate an effect of the addition of UV light disinfection following terminal cleaning on reductions in rates of eiHAIs.
Further investigations targeting hospital environmental surfaces and the role of no-touch technology to reduce HAIs are needed.
