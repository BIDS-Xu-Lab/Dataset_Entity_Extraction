This study investigated the effects of diet and stage of lactation (SOL) on sensory profiles, texture, volatile profiles, and colour of Cheddar cheese.
Cheddar cheese was manufactured from early-, mid-, and late-lactation milk obtained from seasonally calved cows (n = 54).
Cows were assigned a diet; group 1: perennial ryegrass (GRS), group 2: total mixed ration (TMR), and group 3: partial mixed ration (PMR).
Instrumental analysis was performed at 270 days (mature Cheddar).
Sensory evaluation took place after 548 days (extra mature Cheddar).
Toluene was the only volatile compound that was significantly influenced by diet.
The trained panel rated early-lactation cheese as stronger than mid- and late- for cowy/barny flavour and late-lactation cheese as sweeter than early- and mid-lactation cheese.
Mid-lactation cheese was liked least overall.
Early-lactation cheeses were rated higher for 'crumbly' texture than mid- and late.
Diet affected consumer ratings, with GRS and PMR cheese rated as more intense than TMR for flavour, aftertaste, and saltiness.
Consumers reported that TMR cheese was lighter in colour compared to GRS cheese, which was supported by instrumental analysis.
Consumers perceived GRS as more springy and less crumbly than TMR and PMR, while Texture Profile Analysis indicated that TMR was harder than GRS.
Consumer segmentation was observed with two clear preference groups, one preferring GRS and one preferring TMR.
For both groups, 'taste' seemed to be the main driver of liking, highlighting that consumer preference is most impacted by individual taste preferences.
