Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by tissue damage and inflammatory cytokine secretion; however, the therapeutic options available to treat ALI remain limited.
Necrostatin‑1 (Nec‑1) has the ability to attenuate cell necroptosis in various inflammatory diseases.
The present study evaluated the protective effects of Nec‑1 on a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide‑induced ALI.
Histological alterations in the lungs were evaluated through hematoxylin and eosin staining, and the expression levels of cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissues were determined by ELISA.
In addition, accumulated production of reactive oxygen species was determined by staining with DCFH‑DA probes, western blotting and immunofluorescence.
The results revealed that treatment with the necroptosis inhibitor, Nec‑1, exerted significant protective effects on ALI‑induced inflammation and necroptosis.
The key proteins involved in necroptosis were markedly reduced, including receptor‑interacting serine/threonine‑protein kinase (RIP)1 and RIP3.
Notably, antioxidant proteins were upregulated by Nec‑1, which may attenuate oxidative stress.
Furthermore, treatment with Nec‑1 markedly suppressed necroptosis in the pulmonary alveoli RLE‑6TN cell line.
Taken together, these data revealed a novel association between ALI and necroptosis, and suggested that necroptosis inhibitors may be used as effective anti‑inflammatory drugs to treat ALI.
