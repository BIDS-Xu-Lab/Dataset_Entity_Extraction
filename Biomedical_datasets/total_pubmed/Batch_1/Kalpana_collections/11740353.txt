An in vivo sheep model with loaded pedicle screws was used, wherein each animal served as its own control.
To examine the effects of hydroxyapatite (HA) coating on the bone-to-implant interface in loaded spinal instrumentations.
Spinal instrumentation improves the healing rate in spinal fusion, but screw loosening constitutes a problem.
HA coating of other implants has resulted in favorable effects on the bone-to-implant interface.
Nine sheep were operated on with destabilizing laminectomies at two levels: L2-L3 and L4-L5.
Each level was stabilized separately with a four-screw instrumentation.
Uncoated screws (stainless steel) or the same type of screws coated with plasma-sprayed HA were used in either the upper or the lower instrumentation in a randomized fashion.
The animals were killed at 6 or 12 weeks after surgery.
The specimens were embedded in resin, ground to approximately 10 microm, and stained with toluidine blue.
Histomorphometric evaluation was carried out in a Leitz Aristoplan (Wetzlar, Germany) light microscope equipped with a Leitz Microvid unit.
The average percentage of bone-to-implant contact after 6 weeks was 69 +/- 10 for the HA-coated screws and 18 +/- 11 for the uncoated screws (P < 0.03), and after 12 weeks 64 +/- 31 (HA-coated) and 9 +/- 13 (uncoated, P < 0.02).
The average bone volume in the area close to the screw was significantly higher for the HA-coated screws at both 6 and 12 weeks.
HA coating improved the bone-to-implant interface significantly, indicating that HA coating can become useful for improving the purchase of pedicle screws.
