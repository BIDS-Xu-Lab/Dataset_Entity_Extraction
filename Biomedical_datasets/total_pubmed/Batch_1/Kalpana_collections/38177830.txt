People with serious mental illnesses (SMIs) have three-fold higher rates of comorbid insomnia than the general population, which has downstream effects on cognitive, mental, and physical health.
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-i) is a safe and effective first-line treatment for insomnia, though the therapy's effectiveness relies on completing nightly sleep diaries which can be challenging for some people with SMI and comorbid cognitive deficits.
Supportive technologies such as mobile applications and sleep sensors may aid with completing sleep diaries.
However, commercially available CBT-i apps are not designed for individuals with cognitive deficits.
To aid with this challenge, we have developed an integrated mobile application, named "Sleep Catcher," that will automatically incorporate data from a wearable fitness tracker and a bed sensor to track nightly sleep duration, overnight awakenings, bed-times, and wake-times to generate nightly sleep diaries for CBT-i.
The application development process will be described-writing algorithms to generating useful data, creating a clinician web portal to oversee patients and the mobile application, and integrating sleep data from device platforms and user input.
The mobile and web applications were developed using Flutter, IBM Code Engine, and IBM Cloudant database.
The mobile application was developed with a user-centered approach and incremental changes informed by a series of beta tests.
Special user-interface features were considered to address the challenges of developing a simple and effective mobile application targeting people with SMI.
There is strong potential for synergy between engineering and mental health expertise to develop technologies for specific clinical populations.
Digital health technologies allow for the development of multi-disciplinary solutions to existing health disparities in vulnerable populations, particularly in people with SMI.
