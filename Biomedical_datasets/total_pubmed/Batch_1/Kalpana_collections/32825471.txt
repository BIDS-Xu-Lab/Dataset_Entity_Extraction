With the development of artificial intelligence and big data analytics, an increasing number of researchers have tried to use deep-learning technology to train neural networks and achieved great success in the field of vehicle detection.
However, as a special domain of object detection, vehicle detection in aerial images still has made limited progress because of low resolution, complex backgrounds and rotating objects.
In this paper, an improved feature-balanced pyramid network (FBPN) has been proposed to enhance the network's ability to detect small objects.
By combining FBPN with modified faster region convolutional neural network (faster-RCNN), a vehicle detection framework for aerial images is proposed.
The focal loss function is adopted in the proposed framework to reduce the imbalance between easy and hard samples.
The experimental results based on the VEDIA, USCAS-AOD, and DOTA datasets show that the proposed framework outperforms other state-of-the-art vehicle detection algorithms for aerial images.
