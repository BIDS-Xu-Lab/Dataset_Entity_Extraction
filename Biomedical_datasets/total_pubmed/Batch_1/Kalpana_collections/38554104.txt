Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) and intestinal ultrasound (IUS) have developed rapidly in the last few decades, emerging as the primary non-invasive options for both diagnosing and monitoring Crohn's disease (CD).
In this review, we evaluate the pertinent data relating to the use of MRE and IUS in CD.
We summarise the key imaging features of CD activity, highlight their increasing role in both the clinical and research settings, and discuss how these modalities fit within the diagnostic pathway.
We discuss how they can be used to assess disease activity and treatment responsiveness, including the emergence of activity scores for standardised reporting.
Additionally, we address areas of controversy such as the use of contrast agents, the role of diffusion-weighted imaging, and discuss point-of-care ultrasound.
We also highlight exciting new developments including the applications of artificial intelligence.
Finally, we provide suggestions for future research priorities.
