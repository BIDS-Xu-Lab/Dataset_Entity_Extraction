This review article explores the evolving landscape of Molecular Radiotherapy (MRT), emphasizing Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) for neuroendocrine tumours (NETs).
The primary focus is on the transition from β-emitting radiopharmaceuticals to α-emitting agents in PRRT, offering a critical analysis of the radiobiological basis, clinical applications, and ongoing developments in Targeted Alpha Therapy (TAT).
Through an extensive literature review, the article delves into the mechanisms and effectiveness of PRRT in targeting somatostatin subtype 2 receptors, highlighting both its successes and limitations.
The discussion extends to the emerging paradigm of TAT, underlining its higher potency and specificity with α-particle emissions, which promise enhanced therapeutic efficacy and reduced toxicity.
The review critically evaluates preclinical and clinical data, emphasizing the need for standardised dosimetry and a deeper understanding of the dose-response relationship in TAT.
The review concludes by underscoring the significant potential of TAT in treating SSTR2-overexpressing cancers, especially in patients refractory to β-PRRT, while also acknowledging the current challenges and the necessity for further research to optimize treatment protocols.
