The present research investigated the relationships among sensory attributes and volatile components in dry porcini mushrooms by multivariate statistical analyses.
The sensory characteristics were based on quantitative descriptive analysis and consumer hedonic assessment.
The volatile compounds were extracted by solid-phase microextraction, then were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-olfactometry.
The results showed that the high hedonic rating of porcini mushrooms was due in part to its aroma notes such as seasoning-like, roasted, cacao-like and smoky.
High hedonic liking and positive aromas of porcini mushrooms could be responsible for the volatiles including 3-(methylthio)propanal, 3-(methylthio)propanol, pyrazines, phenolic and furanone components.
On the other hand, raw mushroom-like, cardboard-like, as well as sweaty attributes were attributed to the relatively low hedonic liking of porcini mushrooms, which correlated with high contents of 1-octen-3-ol, octanal, 2-pentylfuran and 3-methylbutanoic acid.
The information reported here could be important for the quality control of commercial porcini mushrooms by providing an approach to strengthen the interpretation of sensory data by showing how they were affected by the chemical properties.
