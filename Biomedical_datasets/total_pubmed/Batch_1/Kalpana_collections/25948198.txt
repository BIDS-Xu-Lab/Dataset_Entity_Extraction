To summarize the clinical characteristics of Burkitt's lymphoma.
Clinical data of 41 Burkitt's lymphoma patients, treated from Jannuary 2009 to June 2014 in Chinese PLA General Hospital, were analyzed retrospectively.
Out of the 41 patients, 33 were males and 8 were females, with a median age of 13 (range, 1-67), 18 cases (43.9%) were in Ann Arbor stage I/II, and 23 cases (56.1%) were in stage III/IV.
The commonest pathologicalal sites were head and neck (23 cases, 56.1%), and then the abdominal (41.5%), bone marrow (22.0%) and central nervous system (22.0%) could also be involved, while 7 cases (17.1%) were patients transformed into acute lymphocytic leukemia-type L3, 18% cases (3/16) were infected by EBV and 29.9% cases (6/38) were infected by HBV, 29 cases were treated with chemotherapy, their overal remission rate was 93.1(27/29 cases), 2-year overall survival rate(OS) was 83.3%(10/12 cases); 13 cases were treated with rituximab, their remission rate was 92.3%(12/13 cases), and 2-year OS was 66.7%(4/6 cases).
The 41 cases are more similar to the sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma, but the median age of its occurence is more younger, while the most common pathological sites are head and neck, and the short-term and high intensive chemotherapy with rituximab can obviously elevate remission rate for adult patients and prolong their survival time.
