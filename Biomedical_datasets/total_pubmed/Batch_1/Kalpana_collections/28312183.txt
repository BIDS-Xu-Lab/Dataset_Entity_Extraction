The life history and population ecology of the skink Morethia boulengeri were studied from September 1985 to May 1987 in populations in a riverine woodland habitat and at an abandoned homestead in Kinchega National Park.
The population dynamics and life histories of the two populations were remarkably similar.
Yearly mortality (including emigration) ranged from 0.84-0.89.
The yearly emigration rate was 0.01-0.03.
Size-and body-condition-dependent mortality could be demonstrated for the population in riverine woodland.
Average spring time densities were similar in both study sites but varied between years and ranged from 421-1823 individuals/ha.
M. boulengeri females laid on average 2.8 eggs per clutch and usually produced three clutches per year.
Egg mass was significantly correlated with female snout-vent-length, but relative clutch mass and egg size were not.
All surviving juveniles reproduced for the first time in their first year.
Some activity occurred throughout the year.
Preferred body temperatures decreased in the cooler months.
The data fit demographic models of life history evolution.
