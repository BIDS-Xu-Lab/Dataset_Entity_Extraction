Several studies have explored the relationship among traditional semen parameters, sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF), and unexplained recurrent miscarriage (RM); however, the findings remain controversial.
Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis to explore the relationship among traditional semen parameters, SDF, and unexplained RM.
Multiple databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), were searched to identify relevant publications.
From the eligible publications, data were extracted independently by two researchers.
A total of 280 publications were identified using the search strategy.
According to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 19 publications were eligible.
A total of 1182 couples with unexplained RM and 1231 couples without RM were included in this meta-analysis to assess the relationship among traditional semen parameters, SDF, and unexplained RM.
Our results showed that couples with unexplained RM had significantly increased levels of SDF and significantly decreased levels of total motility and progressive motility compared with couples without RM, although significant differences were not observed in the semen volume, sperm concentration, and total sperm count between couples with and without RM.
The SDF assay may be considered for inclusion in evaluations of couples with unexplained RM.
