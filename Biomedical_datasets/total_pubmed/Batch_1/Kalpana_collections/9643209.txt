The purpose of this study was to compare the shear bond strengths of two adhesive systems to the primary and permanent dentin.
Labial surfaces of extracted and frozen bovine mandibular primary incisors and permanent incisors were ground with #600 grit SiC paper to expose dentin.
Superbond D Liner (Group SDL) tooth surface conditioner and adhesive were applied and bonded with resin composite.
A shear bond strength (SBS) test was performed and the data were analyzed by an ANOVA (P < 0.05).
After the SBS test, the test surfaces of the dentin and the resin were observed using SEM.
SBS on the primary dentin were significantly higher than those on the permanent dentin, both in the nonthermal cycled groups and the thermal cycled groups with the exception of the thermal cycled group of Group SDL.
In the thermal cycled group of Group SDL, there was no significant difference between SBS on the primary dentin and SBS on the permanent dentin.
Bond strengths on the primary dentin were found to be significantly higher than those on the permanent dentin, when using All Bond 2 or Superbond D Liner adhesive systems.
