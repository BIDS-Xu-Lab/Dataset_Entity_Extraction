Glycosylphosphatidyl-inositols (GPIs) are vital major glycoconjugates in intraerythrocytic stages of Plasmodium.
Here, we report on the biosynthesis and the characterization of GPIs synthesized by the murine malarial parasite P. yoelii yoelii YM.
Parasitized erythrocytes were labeled in vivo and in vitro with either radioactive nucleotide sugar precursors, ethanolamine or glucosamine.
The pathway leading to the formation of GPI precursors was found to resemble that described for P. falciparum; however, in P. yoelii, the formation of an additional hydrophilic precursor containing an acid-labile modification was detected.
The data suggest that this modification is linked to the fourth mannose attached to the trimannosyl backbone in an alpha1-2 linkage.
The modification was susceptible to hydrofluoric acid (HF), but not to nitrous acid (HNO(2)).
Data obtained from size-exclusion chromatography on Bio-Gel P4, and Mono Q analysis of the fragments generated by HNO(2) deamination suggest that the modification is due to the presence of an additional ethanolamine linked to the fourth mannose via a phosphodiester bond.
