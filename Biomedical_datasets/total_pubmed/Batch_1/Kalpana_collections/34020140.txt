Mast cells (MCs) are present in various organs including the skin, peritoneal cavity, lung, and intestine and involved in the development of allergic diseases and host defense against infection.
However, the regulatory mechanism of mast cell activation remains incompletely understood.
We found in a database that Clec12b encoding a C-type lectin receptor Clec12b is preferentially expressed in skin MCs in mice.
However, neither MCs in other tissues such as trachea, tongue, esophagus, or peritoneal cavity nor most lymphocytes and myeloid cells express Clec12b.
To analyze the protein expression of Clec12b, we newly generated a monoclonal antibody (named TX109), which recognizes both mouse and human Clec12b.
Consistent with the gene expression profile, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that Clec12b is expressed only on MCs in the skin, but not on any other immune cell types in various tissues, in mice.
Similarly, Clec12b is also expressed on skin MCs, but not on circulating lymphocytes and myeloid cells, in humans.
Our results suggest that Clec12b plays an important role in the regulation of MCs activation in the skin.
