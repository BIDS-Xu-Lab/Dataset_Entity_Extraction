A case study approach will be used to demonstrate the effectiveness of a continuous quality improvement team designed to explore the process of preoperative medical record completeness.
The goal of this team was to improve essential chart components (e.g., electrocardiography, history and physical examination) required 48 hours before the date of surgery in an effort to facilitate optimum patient management and timely flow of patients to the operating room.
When the 48-hour compliance rule is followed, the nurse reviewer has sufficient time to review all patient data and notify attending physicians or designees of any abnormalities.
In essence, improving component compliance provides better quality care because patients are able to be assessed before surgery with enough time to solve any problems.
