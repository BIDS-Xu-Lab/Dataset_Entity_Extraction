Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a major cause of respiratory illness in young children.
The HMPV polymerase (L) binds an obligate cofactor, the phosphoprotein (P).
During replication and transcription, the L/P complex traverses the viral RNA genome, which is encapsidated within nucleoproteins (N).
An essential interaction between N and a C-terminal region of P tethers the L/P polymerase to the template.
This N-P interaction is also involved in the formation of cytoplasmic viral factories in infected cells, called inclusion bodies.
To define how the polymerase component P recognizes N-encapsidated RNA (N-RNA) we employed cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and molecular dynamics simulations, coupled to activity assays and imaging of inclusion bodies in cells.
We report a 2.9 Å resolution structure of a triple-complex between multimeric N, bound to both RNA and the C-terminal region of P. Furthermore, we also present cryo-EM structures of assembled N in different oligomeric states, highlighting the plasticity of N. Combined with our functional assays, these structural data delineate in molecular detail how P attaches to N-RNA whilst retaining substantial conformational dynamics.
Moreover, the N-RNA-P triple complex structure provides a molecular blueprint for the design of therapeutics to potentially disrupt the attachment of L/P to its template.
