This article presents a series of goals and questions for future research in ossiculoplasty.
Important technical questions include what are the best materials, prosthesis shapes, and techniques of placement for both immediate and long-term success.
Important clinical questions include what improvements in communication should we expect, how should cases be selected, and how should patients be counseled.
There are many variables that could affect reported results, including the selection of cases, audiometric techniques, the frequencies of hearing measurement, and the methods of data analysis.
These are all discussed in this article.
