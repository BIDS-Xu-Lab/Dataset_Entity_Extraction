Adjustment in dose based on body size is not recommended currently for thrombolytic regimens, except for a reduction in alteplase (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator [rt-PA]) dose for safety reasons in patients with low body weight.
It is unresolved how to dose thrombolytic agents in very heavy patients.
The study objective was to assess whether patency of the infarct-related artery at 1 day after therapy with anistreplase (anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex [APSAC]) or rt-PA is adversely affected by increased body weight.
Data were analyzed from a double-blind, randomized, comparative study of APSAC (30 U/5 min) versus rt-PA (100 mg/3 hours, adjusted downward for body weight <
65 kg), together with heparin and aspirin, in patients with acute myocardial infarction presenting within 4 hours of symptom onset.
Coronary patency, determined at 1 day, was assessed in a blinded fashion, and patency success was correlated with body weight, divided into quintiles.
[p = 0.64]; and 82 and 74%, respectively, for grade 3 [p = 0.42]).
The dose of heparin administered, adjusted to maintain a therapeutic partial thromboplastin time until the 1-day (mean 28 hours) angiogram, was greater in the heavy than in the low-normal weight group (mean +/- SE 39,680 +/- 4,818 vs 30,027 +/- 1,177 U; p = 0.007).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
