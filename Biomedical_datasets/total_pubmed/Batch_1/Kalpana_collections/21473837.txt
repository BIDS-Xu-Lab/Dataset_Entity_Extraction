Dental trauma in children is a frequent and often complex clinical event in which laser-assisted therapy, particularly using erbium lasers, can offer new treatment possibilities, improving the outcomes and reducing the associated complications.
In particular, it is worth considering that the use of laser-assisted therapies is associated with a marked reduction in the use of analgesics and anti-inflammatory medications compared with conventional procedures.
Laser anaesthesia is another interesting and challenging area.
Given the paucity of data on laser-assisted dental trauma therapy in the international literature and the absence of well-structured guidelines, this is an area ripe for scientific research.
