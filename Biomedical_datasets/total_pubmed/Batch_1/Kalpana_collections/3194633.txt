Reproducibility of nasal resistance recording is important if meaningful clinical and investigative data are to be assembled.
The present study investigated by duplicate determination, reproducibility of anterior (unilateral) and posterior (bilateral) recordings of nasal respiratory resistance (NRR) for 12 subjects.
Improved accuracy was achieved with frequent use of a calibration device and visual feedback for the patient.
The results show that the recordings are reproducible with a small method error of between 13.6 Pascals/cc/sec x 10(3) and 41.5 Pascals/cc/sec x 10(3).
