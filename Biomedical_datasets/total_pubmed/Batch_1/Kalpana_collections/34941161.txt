Acupoint injection has currently received increasing attention as a treatment for hemiplegia.
A number of studies have reported that acupoint injection have some advantages in treatment of hemiplegia.
However, currently no article has summarized the existing evidence.
Our study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupoint injection as a clinical treatment for hemiplegia, so that it can provide an important reference for clinical decision-making.
Randomized controlled trials and case control studies of acupoint injection for hemiplegia according to the included and excluded standard were identified in searches of 6 databases from their inception to February 2021.
All data were assessed and extracted by 2 authors independently.
The risk of bias assessment recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration was used to assess the quality of the selected studies.
Review Manager 5.4 (Cochrane Collaboration) was used to conduct meta-analysis for the efficacy and safety of acupoint injection.
The results of this systemic review and meta-analysis will be submitted to a recognized journal for publication.
This systemic review and meta-analysis will evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupoint injection as a clinical treatment for hemiplegia.
We hope this study can make a definitive conclusion for acupoint injection in the treatment of hemiplegia.
