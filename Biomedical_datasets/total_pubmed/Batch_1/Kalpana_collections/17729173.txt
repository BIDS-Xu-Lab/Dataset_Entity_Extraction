This article describes the experiences of men who experienced intraparental homicide (one parent killing the other parent) when they were boys.
Twenty-one men were interviewed twice and data were analyzed using a hermeneutic approach.
In this article we examine a topic that emerged as a core problem for these men, specifically, how they talked (or did not talk) about the homicide.
Understanding intraparental homicide may provide information to guardians and professionals about what some male children need after such an event.
