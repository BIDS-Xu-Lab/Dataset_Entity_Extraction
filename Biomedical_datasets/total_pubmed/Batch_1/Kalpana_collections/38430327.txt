An advisory board meeting was held with experts in Vietnam (Hanoi, August 2022), to review the evidence on invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) epidemiology, clinical management, and meningococcal vaccines to reach a consensus on recommendations for meningococcal vaccination in Vietnam.
IMD is a severe disease, with the highest burden in infants and children.
IMD presents as meningitis and/or meningococcemia and can progress extremely rapidly.
Almost 90% of deaths in children occur within the first 24Â h, and disabling sequelae (e.g., limb amputations and neurological damage) occur in up to 20% of survivors.
IMD patients are often hospitalized late, due to mild and nonspecific early symptoms and misdiagnosis.
Difficulties related to diagnosis and antibiotic misuse mean that the number of reported IMD cases in Vietnam is likely to be underestimated.
Serogroup B IMD is predominant in many regions of the world, including Vietnam, where 82% of IMD cases were due to serogroup B (surveillance data from 2012 to 2021).
Four component meningococcal B vaccine (4CMenB) is used in many countries (and is part of the pediatric National Immunization Program in 13 countries), with infant vaccination starting from two months of age, and a 2 + 1 dosing schedule.
Experts recommend 4CMenB vaccination as soon as possible in Vietnam, starting from two months of age, with a 2 + 1 dosing schedule, and at least completing one dose before 6 months of age.
