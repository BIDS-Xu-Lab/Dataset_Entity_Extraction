Aortic valve stenosis is the most prevalent valvulopathy in the elderly, but it is frequently undertreated.
To assess early and long term results of valve replacement with bioprostheses in patients 70 years old or older with aortic stenosis.
A review of the database of the Cardiovascular Surgery Service of our hospital, for the period 1990-2007, identified 156 patients with aortic valve stenosis, aged 76.7 ± 4.5 years (67% males), that were subjected to an aortic valve replacement with bioprosthesis.
Seventy eight (50%) were in functional class III-IV.
In 67 patients (43%) coronary artery bypass graft were performed.
Long term mortality was ascertained obtaining death records from Chilean death registry.
Operative mortality was 3.2% (5 patients).
Four patients (2.6%) required a reoperation due to bleeding.
The mean follow up was 66 ± 41 months.
The survival rate at 1, 3 and 5 years was 94%, 88% and 80%, respectively.
Forty two patients (27%) were 80 years old or older.
In this sub-group, 1 patient (2.3%) died during the peri operative period and the estimated survival rate at 1, 3 and 5 years was 97%, 92%, and 80%, respectively.
Multivariate risk analysis, for the whole group, identified low ejection fraction and concomitant coronary artery bypass graft surgery as predictors of late mortality.
Aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis with bioprostheses in patients 70 years old or older had low perioperative mortality and morbidity and a good long term survival.
