Sonar performance predictions of reverberation in shallow water rely upon good estimates of the bottom-scattering strength.
However, little is understood about bottom scattering in shallow water in the frequency range 400-4000 Hz, particularly its dependency upon frequency and its relationship to the physical properties of the seafloor.
In order to address these issues, a new measurement technique has been developed to probe the frequency and angular dependency of bottom-scattering strength.
The experimental technique is described which employs either coherent or incoherent sources (lightbulbs).
In addition, measurement and modeling results for two diverse shallow water sites are presented.
At one site, the scattering appears to arise at or near the water-sediment interface.
At the other site, scattering from a 23-m sub-bottom horizon is clearly apparent in the data at and below 1800 Hz.
The fact that our measurement technique can directly reveal the presence of sub-bottom scattering is a significant advance in the development of methods to explore the physical mechanisms that control bottom scattering.
