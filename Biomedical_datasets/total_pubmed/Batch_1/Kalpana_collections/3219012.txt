The necessity of rapid objective appraisal of the suspicion of intracorporeal drug smuggling (body-packing) by effective methods of investigation in the course of the first criminal investigation department measures raises the questions of suitable and admissible methods.
The proportion of undetected crimes in intracorporeal narcotic smuggling must be rated as very high according to the data of the Federal Criminal Investigation Department.
In the present paper, the suitability of various imaging techniques for drug detection are reported in terms of their risk, practicability and costs.
For this purpose, the value of digital radiography, two-spectra radiography and X-ray computer tomography as compared to conventional X-ray investigations is examined in human experiments.
A reality-oriented narcotics dummy (glucose pressed hard in preservative) was developed and administered to nine volunteers per os with a variable initial alimentary situation.
Four radiograms were taken at fixed times up to 12 hours after administration with each imaging technique.
The highest rate of detection was attained with computer tomography.
In contrast to the other methods, more than 90% of the body packs could be identified here.
Nevertheless, an application in criminal investigation practice cannot be recommended owing to various disadvantages.
The recovery rate of the remaining methods is between 20% and 25%.
