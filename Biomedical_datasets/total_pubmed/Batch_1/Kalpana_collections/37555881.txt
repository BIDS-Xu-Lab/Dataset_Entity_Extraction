Transjugular liver biopsy (TJLB) procedurally samples liver tissue through the internal jugular vein.
It is indicated in the presence of coagulopathies and/or ascites.
This meta-analysis aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of TJLB in children.
A literature search of several databases was conducted from inception to August 2022.
Eligible studies reported pediatric patients (< 18 years old) who underwent TJLB.
The pooled proportion was analyzed using a random-effects model.
This review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022354421).
From 921 initial studies screened, eight met the eligibility criteria, with a total of 361 pediatric patients who underwent 374 TJLBs.
All eight studies reported pooled rates of technical success at 99.1% (95% CI 0.982, 1.001; I2 = 0%) and histological adequacy of sampling at 97.5% (95% CI 0.954, 0.995; I2 = 27.66%).
A total of 49 complications were reported across six studies, the most common being bleeding from the entry site (38.78%), fevers for less than 24 h (12.24%), red blood cells transfusion requirement (10.2%), supraventricular tachycardia (8.16%), and pain requiring analgesia (8.16%).
Pediatric TJLB demonstrates high rates of technical success and adequate liver core biopsy samples, with a low rate of complications.
These results suggest that TJLB is an effective method for diagnostic yield and postprocedural outcomes, especially in patients with preexisting coagulopathies and ascites where percutaneous liver biopsy is contraindicated.
Additional studies evaluating larger groups of pediatric patients may provide further support for the use of TJLB in this population.
