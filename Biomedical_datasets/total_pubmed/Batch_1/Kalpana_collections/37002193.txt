Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder, and its specific pathogenesis is still unclear.
We have previously reported that TTX-resistant (TTX-R) sodium channels in colon-specific dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were sensitized in a rat model of visceral hypersensitivity induced by neonatal colonic inflammation (NCI).
However, the detailed molecular mechanism for activation of sodium channels remains unknown.
This study was designed to examine roles for Melatonin (MT) in sensitization of sodium channels in NCI rats.
Colorectal distention (CRD) in adult male rats as a measure of visceral hypersensitivity.
Colon-specific dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were labeled with DiI and acutely dissociated for measuring excitability and sodium channel current under whole-cell patch clamp configurations.
Western blot and Immunofluorescence were employed to detect changes in expression of Nav1.8 and MT2.
The results showed that rats exhibited visceral hypersensitivity after NCI treatment.
Intrathecal application of melatonin significantly increased the threshold of CRD in NCI rats with a dose-dependent manner, but has no role in the control group.
Whole-cell patch clamp recording showed that melatonin remarkably decreased the excitability and the density of TTX-R sodium channel in DRG neurons from NCI rats.
The expression of MT2 receptor at the protein level was markedly lower in NCI rats.
8-MP, an agonist of MT2 receptor, enhanced the distention threshold in NCI rats.
Application of 8-MP reversed the enhanced hypersensitivity of DRG neurons from NCI rats.
8-MP also reduced TTX-R sodium current density and modulated dynamics of TTX-R sodium current activation.
These data suggest that sensitization of sodium channels of colon DRG neurons in NCI rats is most likely mediated by MT2 receptor, thus identifying a potential target for treatment for chronic visceral pain in patients with IBS.
