Horses were provided full-time housing in unfamiliar vector-protected facilities during the African horse sickness (AHS) outbreak in Thailand.
This study aimed to investigate the impact of this housing arrangement on the equine stress response.
Nine healthy horses were housed in both a traditional barn and a vector-protected barn.
Equine behavior and stress response data were collected in association with the housing environment and time of day.
The mean behavioral score of horses housed in the vector-protected barn was lower at night than during the day.
In addition, the horses' mean heart rate at night was lower than their heart rate during the day, irrespective of housing condition.
Furthermore, although blood cortisol peaked at 6:00 AM and was lowest at 6:00 PM under both housing conditions, daily fluctuations in blood cortisol levels were correlated with changes in humidity and temperature in both environments.
Finally, horses housed in the traditional barn exhibited earlier decreases in cortisol levels relative to the horses in the vector-protected barn.
This result indicates that housing horses in vector-protected facilities may impose stress.
