To analyze the association between risk factors and presence of overweight in adolescents from different socioeconomic levels.
A cross-section analysis with 888 youths recruited from both genders with ages ranging from 11 to 17 years was carried out.
The body mass index was calculated through body mass and height values, and was used as the overweight indicator.
Physical activity, food intake, and socioeconomic levels (high and low) were obtained by questionnaires.
Data were analyzed by chi-square test and binary logistic regression.
[OR]= 4.59) and parent overweight (OR= 5.33) were associated to overweight.
Among adolescents in the higher socioeconomic level, maternal education (OR= 0.57), study in private school (OR= 3.04), and parent overweight (OR= 3.47) were associated to development of overweight.
In both socioeconomic levels, parent overweight was an important risk factor associated with overweight.
The other risk factors were different among the socioeconomic levels.
