The review considers molecular mechanisms of chronic renal failure and cancer kidney disease.
The most important molecules inducing inflammation are cytokines (MCP-1, TNFalpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1,6,8,18), matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2,3,9,14, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and grow factors (VEGF PDGE FGF).
This signal molecules regulate the activity of immune cells and remodeling extracellular matrix (ECM) components taken place in inflammatory reactions, proliferation, apoptosis and also in the differentiation of kidney cells.
On the basis of these data nowadays developed new highly selective approaches to diagnosis, prediction, estimation of efficiency of treatment of renal disease and creating of target drugs.
