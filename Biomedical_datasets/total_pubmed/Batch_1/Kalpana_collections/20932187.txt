The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of two different disinfection treatments--ozone and Nd:YAG laser application--on shear-bond strength (SBS) of self-etch adhesives to coronal and root dentin.
Sixty extracted human canines were ground flat, exposing the coronal and root dentin surfaces, and randomly divided into three groups.
The surfaces were untreated (Control) or treated with ozone (HealOzone, KaVo) or Nd:YAG laser (Fidelis III, Fotona).
Coronal and root dentins of 10 teeth of each group were treated with a two-step self-etch adhesive (Clearfil SE Bond, Kuraray Medical; SE), whereas the remaining 10 teeth were treated with a one-step self-etch adhesive (Clearfil Tri-S Bond, Kuraray Medical; S3).
A resin composite (Clearfil Majesty Esthetics, Kuraray Medical) was then placed, and SBS was tested with a universal testing machine.
Failure modes were determined under a stereomicroscope.
The mean SBS values of each group were calculated, and data were subjected to statistical analysis (p = 0.05).
For the coronal dentin, Control/SE showed significantly higher values than Control/S3, Ozone/S3, and Nd:YAG/S3.
Although Ozone/SE showed significantly higher values than Nd:YAG/S3 (p < 0.05), the differences within the other groups were not significant for the root dentin (p > 0.05).
Comparison of two dentin substrates in each group did not show any significant difference except for Control/SE, in which coronal dentin showed higher SBS.
The failure modes of all groups were mainly adhesive.
Pretreatments with Ozone or Nd:YAG laser did not impair the SBS of both of the self-etch adhesives used to coronal and root dentin.
