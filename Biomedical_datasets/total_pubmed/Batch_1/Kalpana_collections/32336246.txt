Assays for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) provides an innovative approach to study chromatin status in multiple cell types.
Moreover, it is also possible to efficiently extract differentially accessible chromatin (DACs) regions by using state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g. DESeq2) to predict gene activity in specific samples.
Furthermore, it has recently been shown that small dips in sequencing peaks can be attributed to the binding of transcription factors.
These dips, also known as footprints, can be used to identify trans-regulating interactions leading to gene expression.
Current protocols used to identify footprints (e.g. pyDNAse and HINT-ATAC) have shown limitations resulting in the discovery of many false positive footprints.
We generated a novel approach to identify genuine footprints within any given ATAC-seq dataset.
Herein, we developed a new pipeline embedding DACs together with bona fide footprints resulting in the generation of a Predictive gene regulatory Network (PreNet) simply from ATAC-seq data.
We further demonstrated that PreNet can be used to unveil meaningful molecular regulatory pathways in a given cell type.
