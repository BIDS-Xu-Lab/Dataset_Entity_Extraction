Dithiocarbamate Fungicides (DTFs) are widely analyzed and studied mainly due to the fact that they play an important role in the cultivation of fruits and vegetables.
This manuscript aims to display the results of a bibliometric analysis based on the Web of ScienceÂ© database, performed in the DTF and food research area.
A total of 374 publications were examined.
The most scientific production was concentrated between 2012 and 2021, showing a decrease of 32% over the last two years.
The Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, India, and Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology were the most productive journal, country, and institution, respectively.
Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy index showed a decrease of 95% in the last last years studied.
Finally, current and future trends should focus on keywords such as individual DTF (Mancozeb, Thiram and Maneb), metabolites (Ethylenethiourea, Propilenthiourea) and a change in the analysis methodology: HPLC versus traditional GC.
