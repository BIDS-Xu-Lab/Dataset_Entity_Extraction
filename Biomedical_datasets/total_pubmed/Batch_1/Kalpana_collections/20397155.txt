The reaction of potassium 2,5-bis[N-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)iminomethyl]pyrrolyl [(dip(2)-pyr)K] with the borohydrides of the larger rare-earth metals, [Ln(BH(4))(3)(thf)(3)] (Ln=La, Nd), afforded the expected products [Ln(BH(4))(2)(dip(2)-pyr)(thf)(2)].
As usual, the trisborohydrides reacted like pseudohalide compounds forming KBH(4) as a by-product.
[NdCl(2)(dip(2)-pyr)(thf)](2) was prepared by reaction of [(dip(2)-pyr)K] with anhydrous NdCl(3).
Reaction of [(dip(2)-pyr)K] with the borohydrides of the smaller rare-earth metals, [Sc(BH(4))(3)(thf)(2)] and [Lu(BH(4))(3)(thf)(3)], resulted in a redox reaction of the BH(4) (-) group with one of the Schiff base functions of the ligand.
In the resulting products, [Ln(BH(4)){(dip)(dip-BH(3))-pyr}(thf)(2)] (Ln=Sc, Lu), a dinegatively charged ligand with a new amido function, a Schiff base, and the pyrrolyl function is bound to the metal atom.
The by-product of the reaction of the BH(4) (-) anion with the Schiff base function (a BH(3) molecule) is trapped in a unique reaction mode in the coordination sphere of the metal complex.
The BH(3) molecule coordinates in an eta(2) fashion to the metal atom.
The rare-earth-metal atoms are surrounded by the eta(2)-coordinated BH(3) molecule, the eta(3)-coordinated BH(4) (-) anion, two THF molecules, and the nitrogen atoms from the Schiff base and the pyrrolyl function.
All new compounds were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.
Low-temperature X-ray diffraction data at 6 K were collected to locate the hydrogen atoms of [Lu(BH(4)){(dip)(dip-BH(3))-pyr}(thf)(2)].
The (DIP(2)-pyr)(-) borohydride and chloride complexes of neodymium, [Nd(BH(4))(2)(dip(2)-pyr)(thf)(2)] and [NdCl(2)(dip(2)-pyr)(thf)](2), were also used as Ziegler-Natta catalysts for the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene to yield poly(cis-1,4-butadiene).
Very high activities and good cis selectivities were observed by using each of these complexes as a catalyst in the presence of various cocatalyst mixtures.
