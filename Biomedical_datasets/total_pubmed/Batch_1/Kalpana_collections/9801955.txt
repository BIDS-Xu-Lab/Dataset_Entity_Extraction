The Maine Medical Assessment Foundation (MMAF) has involved the participation of hundreds of physicians in study groups to analyze data on small-area variation and assess physician decision-making patterns.
In 1991 the MMAF model was replicated across a tri-state area (Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont) in an effort called the Outcomes Dissemination Project.
Five specialty study groups, each meeting three times a year, examined local and national utilization data and guidelines and research findings, participated in outcomes studies and patient education, and disseminated their findings through society presentations and other feedback efforts.
Physician surveys indicated that all but one of the study groups were successful in making their existence and activities known to the broader medical community.
In the "Partnership Projects," the MMAF and relevant study groups, collaborating with a Maine business coalition, analyzed variations in utilization across employers, types of health plans (for example, health maintenance organization, preferred provider organization, fee-for-service), and small areas.
Through this process, coalition members learned about small-area analysis and the implications of variations in utilization for cost and quality.
The first year of the collaborative projects focused on several issues, including the development and dissemination of a practice guideline for the care of patients with chest pain; the dissemination of a practice guideline for the treatment of patients with acute low back pain; and a project designed to address cesarean section rates.
Innovative partnerships have been crafted to allow the tenets of the MMAF's working relationships with the medical community to remain intact, ensuring the ongoing interest and cooperation of hundreds of Maine physicians.
