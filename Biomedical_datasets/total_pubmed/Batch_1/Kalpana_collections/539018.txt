The article comments on the results of a study conducted in 23 women with H-gestosis, in 43 gravidae of the corresponding period of gestation with healthy kidneys, as well as in a control group of 13 women with healthy kidneys, in order to determine, by means of renal sequence scintigraphy and 131-J-hippurate clearance, the change in renal function caused by H-gestosis.
The clearance data are shown both globally and broken down according to the individual kidneys.
Typical activity-time curves of the relevant groups under examination are also demonstrated.
The results show that with mild to moderate H-gestosis, the clearance equivalents are just below the values found in pregnancy without complications, the difference not being statistically significant.
In the 28th-34th week of pregnancy, the elimination phase above the right renal parenchyma "regions of interest" is enhanced in a partly statistically significant manner, compared with the corresponding control group.
