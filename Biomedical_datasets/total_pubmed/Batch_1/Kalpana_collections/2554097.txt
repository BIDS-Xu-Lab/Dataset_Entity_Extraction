The effect of short-term cholinergic desensitization on muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR)-mediated activation of phospholipase C was investigated in membranes isolated from the bovine iris sphincter smooth muscle.
Membranes prepared from normal or desensitized muscles, prelabeled with either [3H]myo-inositol or 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP, were incubated with a hydrolysis-resistant analogue of GTP, GTP gamma S, or GTP gamma S plus carbachol (CCh), and the production of [3H]myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and the breakdown of polyphosphoinositides were assessed.
In normal membranes, GTP (greater than or equal to 1 mM), GTP gamma S (greater than 10 microM) and GTP gamma S (1 microM) plus CCh (10 microM), but not GDP or GDP beta S, increased phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis and IP3 production.
GTP gamma S increased IP3 accumulation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and CCh, which had no effect on phospholipase C activity in the absence of GTP gamma S, potentiated the effects of GTP gamma S. The effect of CCh plus GTP gamma S on IP3 production was inhibited by atropine, had an absolute requirement for nM amounts of Ca2+ and was not affected by pertussis toxin.
At higher concentrations (greater than 1 microM), Ca2+ alone induced PIP2 hydrolysis.
Short-term exposure (less than 60 min) of the muscle to CCh (100 microM) did not affect the total number (Bmax) of mAChRs nor their affinity (KD) for [3H]-N-methylscopolamine.
Desensitization did, however, result in: (1) a loss of the CCh-high affinity binding state of the sphincter mAChRs in a manner analogous to that produced by GTP gamma S; (2) a loss of the ability of GTP gamma S to affect CCh binding to the receptors; and (3) an attenuation of the GTP gamma S plus CCh-stimulated PIP2 hydrolysis.
In conclusion, the data presented suggest that, in the iris smooth muscle, G-proteins are involved in the coupling of mAChRs to phospholipase C and that short-term cholinergic desensitization results in (1) the uncoupling of the receptor-G-protein complex and (2) the attenuation of mAChR-activation of phospholipase C.
