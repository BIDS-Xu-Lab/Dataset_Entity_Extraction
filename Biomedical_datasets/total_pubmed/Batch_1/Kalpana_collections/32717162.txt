Robotic assisted retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in patients with testicular cancer is controversial.
Lately, unusual recurrence patterns with adverse outcomes after robotic assisted retroperitoneal lymph node dissection have been published.
In this report we determine the feasibility, safety and early oncologic outcome of robotic assisted retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in patients with small volume metastatic testicular cancer.
We retrospectively evaluated 27 consecutive patients with small volume metastatic testicular cancer (October 2010 to November 2019) who underwent robotic assisted retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (unilateral modified template).
Intraoperative and postoperative complications as well as early oncologic outcomes are reported.
Surgery was performed in the primary metastatic setting in 22 (81%), post-chemotherapy in 4 (15%) and for late relapse in 1 patient (4%).
Initial clinical stage was IIA for 14 (52%), IIB for 12 (43%) and III for 1 (4%) patient.
Median operative time, blood loss and length of hospital stay were 175 minutes, 50 ml and 4 days, respectively.
Expectedly, viable tumor was found in 21/27 patients (78%) and 6 patients (22%) showed fibrosis, necrosis or no tumor.
patients experienced intraoperative (Satava II) and 1 (4%) postoperative (Clavien-Dindo IIIb) complications, respectively.
Median followup was 16.5 months (3-69), and 3 (11%)
patients experienced relapse outside of the surgical field after 12, 22 and 36 months.
In highly selected patients with low volume metastatic testicular cancer robotic assisted retroperitoneal lymph node dissection may be indicated, and appears to be technically feasible and comparable with open surgery in terms of complications and early oncologic safety.
Prospective data collection in larger series is necessary to clarify the role and specific indications of this approach.
