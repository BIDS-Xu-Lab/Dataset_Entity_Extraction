A health promotion program was conducted in the Veneto Region in Italy.
Participants were screened for non-communicable diseases and were referred to the nutrition clinic.
The aim of this study was to assess the adherence to the Mediterranean diet in the Italian population by using the "PREvenci칩n con DIeta MEDiterr치nea" questionnaire.
The data showed that 63% of the participants were overweight, 57% presented hypercholesterolemia, 36% were hypertensive and 43% had high blood glucose levels.
The results highlighted a low consumption of protective foods against non-communicable diseases such as fruit, vegetables, fresh fish, legumes and oily dried fruit.
Overall, only 6% of the subjects who visited the nutritional clinic had the maximum adherence to the Mediterranean diet, 73% had an average adherence, followed by 21% with low adherence.
Multivariable analysis between risk factors and socio-demographic characteristics and the adherence to Mediterranean diet revealed that male gender relates directly (p =0.002, AOR = 2.95) to a low adherence.
There are three criteria in the questionnaire for a point in favour of Mediterranean diet which we believe to be inadequate, as they are not in accordance with the Italian guidelines for healthy eating.
The "PREvenci칩n con DIeta MEDiterr치nea" questionnaire, if associated with a food frequency questionnaire or a food intake record, could become a useful tool for nutritional counseling in our Country.
