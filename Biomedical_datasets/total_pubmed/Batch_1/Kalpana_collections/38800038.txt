During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, cognitive impairment of varying degrees of severity began to be observed in a significant percentage of patients.
The present study discussed the impact of immunological processes on structural and functional changes in the central nervous system and the related cognitive disorders.
The purpose of the present review was to analyse and discuss available information from the scientific literature considering the possible relationship between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral infection and cognitive impairment, including NeuroCOVID, frontal syndrome and cytokine storm.
A systematic literature review was conducted using: Google Scholar, Elsevier and the PubMed database.
When searching for materials, the following keywords were used: 'cognitive dysfunctions', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'COVID-19', 'Neuro-SARS2', 'NeuroCOVID', 'frontal syndrome', 'cytokine storm', 'Long COVID-19'.
A total of 96 articles were included in the study.
The analysis focused on the characteristics of each study's materials, methods, results and conclusions.
SARS-CoV-2 infection may induce or influence existing cognitive disorders of various nature and severity.
The influence of immunological factors related to the response against SARS-CoV-2 on the disturbance of cerebral perfusion, the functioning of nerve cells and the neuroprotective effect has been demonstrated.
Particular importance is attached to the cytokine storm and the related difference between pro- and anti-inflammatory effects, oxidative stress, disturbances in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the stress response of the body.
