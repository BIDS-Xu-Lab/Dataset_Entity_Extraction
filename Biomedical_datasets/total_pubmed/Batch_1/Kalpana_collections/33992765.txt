Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health problem.
However, quantitative evaluation of its disease burden is challenging.
This study aimed to estimate the disease burden of bloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by major antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in Japan between 2015 and 2018 in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).
DALYs of BSIs caused by nine major antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in Japan were estimated using comprehensive national surveillance data of all routine bacteriological test results from more than 1400 hospitals between 2015 and 2018.
The methodology of Cassini et al. was modified to enable comparison of the present results with those in other countries.
[95% uncertainty interval (UI) 130.7-145.2] DALYs per 100,000 population were attributable to BSIs caused by nine antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in 2018.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli (FQREC) and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli (3GREC) accounted for 87.2% overall.
The burden did not decrease during the study period and was highest in people aged â‰¥65 years.
The results revealed, for the first time, the disease burden of BSIs caused by nine major antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in Japan.
The estimated disease burden associated with AMR in Japan is substantial and has not begun to decrease.
Notably, the burden from FQREC and 3GREC has increased steadily, and that from MRSA is larger in Japan than in the European Union/European Economic Area, whereas the burden from other bacteria is comparatively small.
These results are expected to provide useful information for healthcare policy makers for prioritizing interventions for AMR.
