To identify risk factors for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
Medical history data, including reported urological conditions and treatments, and risk factor data were collected from 34 694 participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO)
Cancer Screening Trial, a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate methods for the early detection of cancer.
Asian men had the lowest risks (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval) for nocturia (0.7, 0.5-0.9), physician-diagnosed BPH (0.3, 0.2-0.5) and transurethral prostatectomy (TURP, 0.2, 0.1-0.6), while risks for Whites and Blacks were similar for most measures of BPH.
Greater alcohol intake was associated with decreased nocturia (P trend = 0.002), BPH (P trend < 0.001) and TURP (P trend < 0.001).
Current tobacco use was associated with decreased nocturia (0.8, 0.7-0.9), BPH (0.7, 0.6-0.8) and TURP (0.6, 0.4-0.8) but dose-response patterns were weak.
Asian-Americans have the lowest risk of clinical BPH.
Alcohol and possibly cigarettes are related to a lower risk for BPH.
