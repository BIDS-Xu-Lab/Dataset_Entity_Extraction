monocot and dicot species of herbaceous plants from 20 angiosperm families.
the data on haploid DNA content (C(val)) for the same species from the website (http://data.kew.org/cvalues).
The distribution range of lm, le, and C(val) was wider in monocot plants compared to dicots.
in monocot and lm in dicot species correlated positively with C(val).
in diploid and polyploid species, both monocots and dicots.
