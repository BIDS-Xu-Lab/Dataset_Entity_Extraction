Various features are provided in dental implants to improve initial fixation.
To compare the implant stability of the nonself-tapping tapered implant and self-tapping hybrid implant over a 3-month healing period.
A randomized controlled trial was conducted.
Patients were randomly divided into tapered and self-tapping groups.
Patients in the tapered group received NobelReplace Tapered (Nobel Biocare, Sweden) implants, while those in the self-tapping group received NobelSpeedy (Nobel Biocare, Sweden) implants.
Implant stability was measured by resonance frequency analysis at surgery and 3 months following implant insertion.
Data were analyzed using an independent t-test.
Forty-three patients (tapered group: 21, self-tapping group: 22) received a total of 88 implants.
Initial stability in the tapered group was significantly higher (mean: 60.14, SD: 12.40) than that in the self-tapping group (mean: 54.72, SD: 7.92).
Implant stability significantly increased 3 months after implantation in the tapered group (mean: 66.61, SD: 9.00) and self-tapping group (mean: 64.01, SD: 5.78).
No significant intergroup difference in implant stability was noted 3 months after surgery.
The tapered shape affected initial fixation more than the self-tapping function.
However, during the second fixation, both implants showed good stability, and the difference disappeared.
