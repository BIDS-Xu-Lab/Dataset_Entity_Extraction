We measured the serum cortisol levels in 15 normal and 8 pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) primigravidas.
The normal pregnancy had a significant (p less than 0.05) higher cortisol level than that of PIH patient.
Especially, 4 severe PIH patients had a significantly (p less than 0.05) lower cortisol level.
The lower maternal cortisol level of PIH patients became more significant with the severity of clinical symptoms of PIH.
After the onset of labor, the cortisol levels of PIH patients did not elevate compared with normal pregnancy.
These data suggest that in the PIH patient the reactivity of the adrenal cortex to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) may be blunted or the cortisol production in the adrenal cortex may be decreased by the tissue circulation insufficiency due to PIH.
