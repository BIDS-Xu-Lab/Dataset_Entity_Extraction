Carbon sources are considered as critical input for the health and immunity of aquatic animals.
The present study investigated the impact of different carbon sources on water quality parameters, carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio and microbial community in sediments, and health responses of marron (Cherax cainii) under laboratory conditions.
Following one week of acclimation, 120 marron were randomly assigned to 12 experimental tanks.
There were four treatments including one untreated control and three groups with carbon addition to maintain a C/N ratio of 12 maintained in culture water.
Carbon supplementation groups included corn flour (CBC12), molasses (MBC12) and wheat flour (WBC12).
At the end of the 60-day trial, MBC12 resulted in the highest sediment C/N ratio, followed by CBC12. Weight gain and specific growth rate were higher in MBC12, compared to control.
The protease activity in marron hepatopancreas, total haemocyte count and lysozyme activity in haemolymph were highest in MBC12.
Analysis of 16S rRNA sequence data of tank sediments revealed increased bacterial alpha diversity in MBC12 and WBC12.
Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in MBC12 (88.6%), followed by control (82.4%) and CBC12 (72.8%).
Sphingobium and Novosphingobium were the most abundant genera in control and MBC12 groups, respectively.
Higher Aeromonas abundance in CBC12 and Flavobacterium in WBC12 were observed.
Overall results indicated that MBC12 led to improved water quality, retaining high C/N ratio and enriched the bacterial populations in sediments resulting in improved growth and immune performance of marron.
