We assess the effect of sildenafil in a subgroup of patients after prostatectomy with erectile dysfunction and determine whether nerve preservation improves sildenafil response in this subgroup.
Between April 1998 and January 1999, 53 patients who had undergone radical retropubic prostatectomy and were prescribed oral sildenafil were surveyed using a confidential mail questionnaire.
Of the patients 21 underwent bilateral and 15 unilateral neurovascular bundle sparing procedures, while in 17 a nonnerve sparing procedure was performed.
mg. sildenafil in a flexible dose escalation manner.
Response, satisfaction and side effects were assessed using a modified, self-administered International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire.
Response was defined as erection sufficient for intercourse.
Preoperative and postoperative/pretreatment erectile functions were assessed for baseline comparison in each patient, and partner overall satisfaction with sildenafil was measured.
Statistical data analysis was performed using analysis of variance and Newman-Keuls multiple comparison tests.
Of the 21 patients who underwent a bilateral nerve sparing procedure 15 had a positive response.
Of the 15 patients who had undergone a unilateral nerve sparing procedure 12 had a positive response, and only 1 of the 17 patients who had undergone a nonnerve sparing procedure responded to sildenafil.
The most commonly reported adverse events of all causes were headaches (21%), flushing (8.3%), visual disturbance (6.3%) and nasal congestion (6.3%).
Sildenafil is an equally effective treatment for erectile dysfunction after bilateral and unilateral nerve sparing procedures, and patient response to sildenafil is confirmed by the partners.
However, patients who undergo nonnerve sparing procedures do not respond satisfactorily to sildenafil.
