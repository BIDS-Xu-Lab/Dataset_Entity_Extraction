Para-chloramphetamine (PCA) is a drug whose long-term and short-term neurochemical and behavioral effects have received considerable attention.
The purpose of the present study was to determine whether PCA produces acute urination, defecation, and body weight changes similar to that seen following various amphetamine derivatives.
Following baseline test sessions, rats were administered either 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 or 10.0 mg/kg of PCA or saline.
Results indicated increased urination at some doses tested.
Increased defecation, salivation, locomotor activities, and body weight losses were also observed.
These data are discussed in terms of possible CNS or peripheral mechanisms of action.
