This paper is a continuation of a study begun in 1978 on attitudes toward death.
A comparison study of Israeli and American adolescent offspring of Holocaust survivors who are in treatment in a residential treatment program in Jerusalem, Israel, is detailed.
Biographical data, diagnostic classifications, a review of Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) responses and some dreams are presented.
Israel is shown to be a therapeutic venue that allows the adolescent to redevelope a damaged identity.
