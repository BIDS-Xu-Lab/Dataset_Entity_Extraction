We constructed a recombinant plasmid by inserting into the pRS314 yeast centromeric plasmid vector the mouse DNA sequence responsible for the maintenance in transgenic mice of plasmid p12B1 (1).
Such constructs could constitute convenient shuttle vectors between yeast and mouse cells.
However, the recombinant molecule could not be established as a stable plasmid in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
A region with a limited similarity to the yeast centromere (CEN element) is present in this mouse sequence as well as in two other sequences subsequently identified in a data bank search using the CEN consensus.
One of them is localized in Bovine Papillomavirus Type 1 DNA, and the other one in the human beta-globin locus.
Once inserted in pRS314, these two sequences showed the same inhibitory effect on plasmid maintenance as the p12B1 mouse DNA fragment.
This effect appears to depend on the simultaneous presence in the construct of one of the "CEN-like regions" and of an authentic CEN element.
Non-centromeric yeast plasmids carrying one of the three sequences could replicate autonomously, and were even stabilized to a significant extent.
These results identify in the genomes of higher eukaryotes and their viruses a family of sequences which cannot be simply cloned in centromeric yeast vectors.
