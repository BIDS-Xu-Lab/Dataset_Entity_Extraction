This paper presents recent financial health trends of community health centers (CHCs) between 1996 and 1999, a time characterized by fiscal and operating challenges.
Results show that many individual CHCs have been subject to large changes in payer-mix among uninsured and Medicaid users.
Troubling is the finding that more than half of all CHCs reported operating deficits in 1997, 1998 and 1999.
CHCs experiencing large increases in the share of uninsured users and those participating in Medicaid managed care appear to have been disproportionately affected.
The analyses presented support recommendations for enhanced data collection and for further monitoring of CHCs' financial health.
