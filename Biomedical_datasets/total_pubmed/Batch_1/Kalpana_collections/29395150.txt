To determine whether treatment of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LS), with topical steroids reduces the rate of circumcision.
Two independent reviewers performed a literature search of studies reporting treatment of LS with topical steroids using EMBASE and MEDLINE database(s).
boys aged 0-18 years, clinical diagnosis of LS, treatment with topical steroids.
Literature reviews, studies of phimosis without LS and adult patients were excluded.
Data analysed for each paper included age, duration of treatment, length of follow up and outcome, notably circumcision or no surgery.
The original search identified 26 titles.
Application of exclusion criteria left 6 articles for inclusion in the study.
Eighty nine patients with LS were treated with topical corticosteroids.
Circumcision was avoided in 31/89 (35%; range 0-100%).
Median patient age was 6.5 years (1 month-15 years).
Median duration of treatment was 2 months (1-23 months); median follow-up 4 months (6 weeks-5 years).
Treatment of LS with topical steroids reportedly avoided circumcision in 35% of boys.
Duration of medical therapy and patient follow up in analysed studies were, however, short.
A prospective randomised trial would provide a definitive answer.
