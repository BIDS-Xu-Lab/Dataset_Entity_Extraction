To evaluate the results of proctocolectomy with creation of an ileac pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA).
Of the 100 patients in whom an IPAA procedure was performed in the period 1994/'99 in the Department of Surgery of the Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, data were collected on the complications: in the patients with a follow-up of over 12 months the functional results were studied.
The group comprised 48 males and 52 females with a mean age of 36.3 years (range: 15-62).
Preoperative diagnoses were ulcerative colitis (n = 84), familial polyposis coli (12), slow transit obstipation (2), Hirschsprung's disease (1) and Muir-Torre syndrome (1).
Median operating time was 2.3 h, peroperative blood and fluid loss 500 ml and median hospital stay 15 days.
Ten patients had a loop ileostomy formation, in 6 because of postoperative complications.
A total of 30 patients developed postoperative complications, peroperatively or during follow-up 10 of those patients needed a relaparotomy.
After 12 months 1 pouch had to be excised and 2 patients still had a loop ileostomy due to postoperative complications.
In 56 patients with at least 12 months follow-up, median 24-hour stool frequency was 6.
Eighty-nine per cent of these patients were satisfied or highly satisfied with the overall outcome.
A proctocolectomy with IPAA formation is a safe procedure with good functional results.
