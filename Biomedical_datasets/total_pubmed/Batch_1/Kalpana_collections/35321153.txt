Quality control (QC) is a vital step for all scientific data analyses and is critically important in the biomedical sciences.
Image segmentation is a common task in medical image analysis, and automated tools to segment many regions from human brain MRIs are now well established.
However, these methods do not always give anatomically correct labels.
Traditional methods for QC tend to reject statistical outliers, which may not necessarily be inaccurate.
Here, we make use of a large database of over 12,000 brain images that contain 68 parcellations of the human cortex, each of which was assessed for anatomical accuracy by a human rater.
We trained three machine learning models to determine if a region was anatomically accurate (as 'pass', or 'fail') and tested the performance on an independent dataset.
We found good performance for the majority of labeled regions.
This work will facilitate more anatomically accurate large-scale multi-site research.
