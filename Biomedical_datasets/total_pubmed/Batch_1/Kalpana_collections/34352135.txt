This study was undertaken to assess the effect of repeated video-training sessions on the adequacy of metered-dose inhaler (MDI) among individuals with COPD.
MDI devices facilitate the use of inhalation drugs in COPD patients and have become ever more important over the years.
However, this device requires a certain level of hand-to-mouth coordination and cognitive ability.
Since it has a high risk of application errors, training in its use is important to treatment success.
This study was carried out from 1 February to 1 July 2017 with the participation of 40 COPD patients.
The data were collected using a 'Patient Information Request Form' and an 'MDI Skill Evaluation Form'.
CONSORT checklist was used to report the current study.
It was found that there was no significant difference between the experimental and control groups in terms of the mean scores of the 1st measurement (p > .05), though the mean scores of the 5th measurement were significantly higher in the experimental group (p < .001).
In the 5th measurement, it was identified that the control group had 'moderate' adequacy (3.20 ± 1.6), while the experimental group had 'satisfactory' adequacy (8.70 ± 1.17), indicating that the patients in the experimental group made fewer mistakes and showed improved adequacy.
It was found that repeated video-training sessions materially improved MDI skills.
Supporting the training on inhaler drug therapy with visual technological tools and regular checking of drug use will contribute to COPD management.
