Accurate assessment of nodal metastasis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is important, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has emerged as a potential technique in differentiating benign from malignant lymph nodes (LNs).
This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of texture analysis using apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) data of multi-shot echo-planar imaging-based DWI (msEPI-DWI) in predicting metastatic LNs of head and neck SCC.
36 patients with pathologically proven head and neck SCC were included in this study.
A total of 204 MRI-detected LNs, including 176 subcentimeter-sized LNs, were assigned to metastatic or benign groups.
Texture features of LNs were compared using independent t-test.
Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to exclude redundant features.
Multivariate logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis were performed to assess the diagnostic performance.
The discriminative texture features for predicting metastatic LNs were complexity, energy and roundness.
Areas under the curves (AUCs) for diagnosing metastasis in all/subcentimeter-sized LNs were 0.829/0.767 using complexity, 0.699/0.685 using energy and 0.671/0.638 using roundness, respectively.
The combination of three features resulted in higher AUC values of 0.836/0.781.
In conclusion, texture analysis of ADC data using msEPI-DWI could be a useful tool for nodal staging in head and neck SCC.
