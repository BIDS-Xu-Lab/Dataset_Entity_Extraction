Thrombosis is a key process that determines acute coronary syndrome and ischemic stroke and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world, together with cancer.
Platelet adhesion and subsequent activation and aggregation are critical processes that cause thrombus formation after endothelial damage.
To date, high hopes are associated with compounds of natural origin, which show anticoagulant action without undesirable effects and can be proposed as supportive therapies.
We investigated the effect of the new combination of four natural compounds, escin-bromelain-ginkgo biloba-sage miltiorrhiza (EBGS), on the initial process of the coagulation cascade, which is the adhesion of platelets to activated vascular endothelium.
Our results demonstrated that EBGS pretreatment of endothelial cells reduces platelet adhesion even in the presence of the monocyte-lymphocyte population.
Our data indicate that EBGS exerts its effects by inhibiting the transcription of adhesion molecules, including P-selectin, platelet membrane glycoprotein GP1b, integrins αV and β3, and reducing the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 6, interleukin 8, and the metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that EBGS inhibited the expression of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), strictly involved in platelet adhesion, and whose activity is correlated with that of integrin β3.
The results shown in this manuscript suggest a possible inhibitory role of the new combination EBGS in the reduction in platelet adhesion to activated endothelium, thus possibly preventing coagulation cascade initiation.
