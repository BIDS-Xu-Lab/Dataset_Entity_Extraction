Numbers of CD34+ cell and total nucleated cell (TNC) and cord blood volume are commonly used as indicators for haematopoietic potential of umbilical cord blood (UCB) units.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between donor-related factors and the quality indicators of UCB.
Obstetric and neonatal clinical laboratory data of a total of 1549 UCB units were obtained from Buddhist Tzu Chi Stem Cells Center (BTCSCC) Cord Blood Bank.
A retrospective multivariate analysis was conducted to analyze the data.
Our results showed that birth weight had positive correlations with each of the clinical features of CD34+ cell number, TNC count and unit volume of UCB, followed by the placental weight.
Longer gestational period would decrease CD34+ cell number and volume of UCB.
Female baby and mode of vaginal delivery of neonates were found to have larger amount of TNC in UCB.
Our results would be helpful and beneficial in building up standard criteria for evaluating stored UCB units.
