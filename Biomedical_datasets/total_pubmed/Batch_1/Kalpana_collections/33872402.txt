Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is promising for oral decontamination.
Curcumin has been used as photosensitizer; however, the hydrophobic properties can negatively affect aPDT.
This study evaluated the aPDT efficacy using Cur-loaded Pluronic® F-127 micelles against Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans biofilms.
Micelles characterization was performed by zeta potential, dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy.
Cur concentrations, cell viability by CFU mL-1 and confocal microscopy were determined.
Data were analyzed by parametric and nonparametric tests under 5%.
Cur-loaded Pluronic® F-127 exhibited spherical shape, suitable particle size (≤100 nm), adequate polydispersity index, best stability, lower photodegradation and autoaggregation compared to unloaded-Cur.
Both microorganisms were sensitive to Cur-loaded Pluronic® F-127 micelles aPDT, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 270 μm and 2.1093 μm for S. mutans and C. albicans suspended culture, respectively.
Cur-loaded Pluronic® F-127 aPDT exhibited antibacterial/antifungal effect against the biofilms (~3 log10 reduction; P ≤ 0.05); however, similar to unloaded (P ≥ 0.05).
Cur-loaded Pluronic® F-127 micelles exhibited good photo-chemical properties and may be a viable alternative to deliver Cur and to improve aPDT effect during the treatment of dental caries.
Moreover, Pluronic® micelles can enhance the solubility, stability, permeability and control the release of Cur.
