The influence of sex hormones on rat plasma T-kininogen concentration was examined.
The level of T-kininogen in the post-pubertal female rat is about 3-times that of the male animal.
Female rats castrated as adults or 15 days after birth, had low T-kininogen concentrations, near those of male rats.
In contrast, castration of mature or immature male animals induced no change in T-kininogen.
Treatment of castrated female or male rats with 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol significantly increased the T-kininogen level, whereas administration of testosterone or progesterone had no effect.
The influence of estrogen was specific for T-kininogen, since plasma HMW kininogen concentration was the same in male and female rats and was not affected by castration or sex hormone treatment.
T-kininogen concentration was not significantly changed in pregnant rat between the 12th and the 20th day of pregnancy, but increased after parturition.
It was high in the newborn rat at birth and then decreased similarly over the next 3 weeks in males and females.
It continued to decrease in the males, reaching the level of the adult rat, but it increased in the female from 3-4 weeks of age and reached the adult level at about 6-8 weeks.
These data indicate that natural estrogens have a physiological influence on the plasma level of T-kininogen in female rats whereas testosterone had no effect on either male or castrated female rats.
HMW kininogen is not physiologically dependent on sex hormones.
