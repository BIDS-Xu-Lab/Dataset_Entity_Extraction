Compared to the conventional farms (CF) rearing of broilers, the rearing management of animal welfare-certified farms (AF) must provide low stocking density, perch, air regulation, and feeding plant-based protein.
This study aimed to compare the effects of rearing management in CF and AF on blood parameters, meat quality, and bioactive compound content in Ross 308 broiler chickens at the farm level before transportation to slaughterhouses.
Blood and meat samples were obtained at 28-35-day-old chickens from three CF and three AF.
In blood samples, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p<0.05), triglyceride (p<0.001), glucose (p<0.01), total protein (p<0.001), albumin (p<0.01), and white blood cell (p<0.001) levels as well as the heterophil/ lymphocyte ratio [stress index (SI), p<0.001] were lower in broilers from AF than in CF.
In meat samples, shear force (p<0.001, p<0.05), and carnosine contents (p<0.001, p<0.05) in both breast and thigh meat from AF were higher than those in meat from CF.
The contents of linoleic acid (p<0.001), Î±-linolenic acid (p<0.001), and eicosapentaenoic acid (p<0.05) were higher in the samples from AF than those from CF.
This study reveals that such differences are influenced by the different rearing factors in nutrition, housing, and management practices between CF and AF.
Supplementation of plant-based protein and enough space to move due to lower stocking density accounts for the large differences between them.
These results can be used as preliminary data showing that the AF system reduces the SI and enhances carnosine and polyunsaturated fatty acids levels in chicken meat at the farm level before transportation.
