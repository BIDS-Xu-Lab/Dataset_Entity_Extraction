Three-dimensional (3D) spheroid models are crucial for cancer research, offering more accurate insights into tumour biology and drug responses than traditional 2D cell cultures.
However, inconsistent and low-throughput spheroid production has hindered their application in drug screening.
Here, we present an automated high-throughput platform for a spheroid selection, fabrication, and sorting system (SFSS) to produce uniform gelatine-encapsulated spheroids (GESs) with high efficiency.
SFSS integrates advanced imaging, analysis, photo-triggered fabrication, and microfluidic sorting to precisely control spheroid size, shape, and viability.
Our data demonstrate that our SFSS can produce over 50 GESs with consistent size and circularity in 30 min with over 97% sorting accuracy while maintaining cell viability and structural integrity.
We demonstrated that the GESs can be used for drug screening and potentially for various assays.
Thus, the SFSS could significantly enhance the efficiency of generating uniform spheroids, facilitating their application in drug development to investigate complex biological systems and drug responses in a more physiologically relevant context.
