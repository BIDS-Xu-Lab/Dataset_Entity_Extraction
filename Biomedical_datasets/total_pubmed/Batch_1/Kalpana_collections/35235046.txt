The glycerol channel AQP7 facilitates glycerol efflux from adipose tissue (AT), and AQP7 deficiency has been suggested to promote obesity.
However, the release of glycerol from AT is not fully blocked in AQP7-deficient mice, which suggests that either alternative glycerol channels are present in AT or significant simple diffusion of glycerol occurs.
Previous investigations of the expression of other aquaglyceroporins (AQP3, AQP9, AQP10) than AQP7 in AT are contradictory.
Therefore, we here aim at determining the cellular localization of AQP3 and AQP9 in addition to AQP7 in human and mouse AT using well-characterized antibodies for immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunoblotting as well as available single-cell transcriptomic data from human and mouse AT.
We confirm that AQP7 is expressed in endothelial cells and adipocytes in human AT and find ex vivo evidence for interaction between AQP7 and perilipin-1 in adipocytes.
In addition, labeling for AQP7 in human AT also includes CD68-positive cells.
No labeling for AQP3 or AQP9 was identified in endothelial cells or adipocytes in human or mouse AT using IHC.
Instead, in human AT, AQP3 was predominantly found in erythrocytes, whereas AQP9 expression was observed in a small number of CD15-positive cells.
The transcriptomic data revealed that AQP3 mRNA was found in a low number of cells in most of the identified cell clusters, whereas AQP9 mRNA was found in myeloid cell clusters as well as in clusters likely representing mesothelial progenitor cells.
No AQP10 mRNA was identified in human AT.
In conclusion, the presented results do not suggest a functional overlap between AQP3/AQP9/AQP10 and AQP7 in human or mouse white AT.
