The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed considerable strain on hospital resources.
We explored whether telemedicine (defined as a videoconference) might help.
We undertook prospective structured phone interviews of urological patients (n = 399).
We evaluated their suitability for telemedicine (judged by a panel of four physicians) and their risks from COVID-19 (10 factors for a poor outcome), and collected willingness for telemedicine and demographic data.
Risk factors for an adverse outcome from COVID-19 infection were common (94.5% had one or more) and most patients (63.2%) were judged suitable for telemedicine.
When asked, 84.7% of patients wished for a telemedical rather than a face-to-face consultation.
There was no difference in preference with oncological (mean 86%) or benign diagnoses (mean 85%), or with COVID-19 risks factors.
We concluded that many urological patients have risk factors for a poor outcome from COVID-19 and most preferred telemedicine consultations at this time.
This appears to be a solution to offer contact-free continuity of care.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Risk factors for a severe course of coronavirus disease 2019 are common (94.5%) in urology patients.
Most patients wished for a telemedical consultation (84.7%).
This appears to be a solution to offer contact-free continuity of care.
