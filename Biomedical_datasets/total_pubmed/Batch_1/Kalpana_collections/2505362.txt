After reviewing recent data concerning the pathologic physiology of cystic fibrosis the authors present an anatomoclinical study of 30 infants, of which 13 neonates, with a diagnosis of mucoviscidosiss, emphasizing the clinical and pathohistologic polymorphism of this affection, and, particularly involvement of the liver and intestines.
Specific hepatic lesions were encountered in only 10% of the group studied (Bodian biliary cirrhosis and mucus stoppers in the bile ducts).
Unspecific hepatic lesions were dominant, common with those of neonatal hepatitis, and hepatic steatosis.
Stress is laid on the presence of atrophy of the villi in children with hepatic steatosis, proof of a lesional substrate of malabsorption in this disease.
The authors note the early onset of hepatic lesions, the gravity of the cases with an early clinical expression and hepatic biopsy puncture as the only method revealing hepatic affection in cystic fibrosis.
In the first semester of life there exists purely digestive forms, hepatic steatosis and oedematous dystrophy in infants at this age being highly suspect of the etiology.
