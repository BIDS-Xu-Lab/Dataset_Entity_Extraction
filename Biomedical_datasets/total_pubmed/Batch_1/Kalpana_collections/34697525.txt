This study explores scholars' approaches to measure performance in nonprofit human service organizations.
While acknowledging that each human service organization's unique mission makes it challenging to create a generalizable model across all nonprofit human service organizations, we propose three multidimensional frameworks for performance measurement derived from survey and qualitative data of organizations in this subsector.
The frameworks will help researchers and practitioners rethink, adapt to, and reflect on the implications of their current methods of program performance measurement.
While contributing to the academic discussion on the measurements used to evaluate human service organizations' program performance, our research also offers important insights for researchers, managers, marketers, board members, and funders to use moving forward.
