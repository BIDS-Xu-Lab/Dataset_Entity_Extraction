This paper reports results obtained using white light diffraction phase microscopy (wDPM) on captured images of breast and colon tissue samples, marking a contribution to the advancement in biomedical imaging.
Unlike conventional brightfield microscopy, wDPM offers the capability to capture intricate details of biological specimens with enhanced clarity and precision.
It combines high resolution, enhanced contrast, and quantitative capabilities with non-invasive, label-free imaging.
These features make it a useful tool for tissue imaging, providing detailed and accurate insights into tissue structure and dynamics without compromising the integrity of the samples.
Our findings underscore the potential of quantitative phase imaging in histopathology, in the context of automating the process of tissue analysis and diagnosis.
Of particular note are the insights gained from the reconstructed phase images, which provide physical data regarding peripheral glandular cell membranes.
These observations serve to focus attention on pathologies involving the basal membrane, such as early invasive carcinoma.
Through our analysis, we aim to contribute to catalyzing further advancements in tissue (breast and colon) imaging.
