The structural evolution of Pb(Mg(1/3)Nb(2/3))O(3) (PMN) has been reviewed in terms of characteristic temperatures, length scales and timescales, with a view to considering the overall relaxor behaviour from the perspectives of strain and elasticity.
A conventional analysis of lattice parameter data in terms of spontaneous strain and strain/order parameter coupling shows that even though a normal phase transition does not occur the relaxor ordering process is accompanied by a significant volume strain which follows the pattern of a static order parameter evolving according to that expected for a tricritical phase transition with T(c)
K. This matches the evolution of the intensity of the elastic central peak in neutron scattering spectra, and reflects the development of static (or quasistatic) polar nanoregions (PNRs) as if by a mean-field phase transition.
Use of a Landau free energy expansion, which includes Γ4(-) order parameter components to describe ferroelectric contributions and an R1(+) order parameter to describe cation ordering together with their formal coupling with strain, then allows the pattern of elastic softening expected for a cubic → rhombohedral phase transition to be anticipated.
The extent to which observed softening differs from this static mean-field pattern serves to highlight the additional roles of local heterogeneity and relaxation dynamics in determining the relaxor properties of PMN.
