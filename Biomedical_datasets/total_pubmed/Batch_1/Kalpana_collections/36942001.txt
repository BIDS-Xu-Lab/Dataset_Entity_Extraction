Hip fractures are a major public health problem with increasing relevance in aging societies.
They are associated with high mortality rates, morbidity, and loss of independence.
The aim of the EMAAge study was to determine the impact of hip fractures on patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and to identify potential risk factors for worse outcomes.
EMAAge is a multicenter, prospective cohort study of patients who suffered a hip fracture.
Patients or, if necessary, proxies were interviewed after initial treatment and after six months using standardized questionnaires including the EQ-5D-5L instrument, the Oxford Hip Score, the PHQ-4, the Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire, and items on patients living situation.
Medical data on diagnoses, comorbidities, medications, and hospital care were derived from hospital information systems.
A total of 326 patients were included.
EQ-5D index values decreased from a mean of 0.70 at baseline to 0.63 at six months.
The mean self-rated health on the EQ-VAS decreased from 69.9 to 59.4.
Multivariable linear regression models revealed three relevant associated factors with the six-months EQ-5D index: symptoms of depression and anxiety, pre-fracture limitations in activities of daily living, and no referral to a rehabilitation facility had a negative impact.
In addition, the six-months EQ-VAS was negatively associated with polypharmacy, living in a facility, and migration background.
Hip fractures have a substantial negative impact on patients HRQOL.
Our results suggest that there are modifying factors that need further investigation including polypharmacy and migration background.
Structured and timely rehabilitation seems to be a protective factor.
