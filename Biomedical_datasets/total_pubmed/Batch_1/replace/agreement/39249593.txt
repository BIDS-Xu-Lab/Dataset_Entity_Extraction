Apalutamide plus androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) improved outcomes in patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC).
The aim of this multicenter study was to generate real-world data from nmCRPC patients treated with ADT plus apalutamide.
In this observational cohort based investigator initiated trial data of nmCRPC patients receiving apalutamide plus ADT were collected focusing on patient demographic data, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) declines, safety profile including dose modification/discontinuation as well as subsequent therapy and metastasis-free survival (MFS).
Data from a total of 31 nmCRPC patients were documented.
Compared to the Phase III study Spartan real-world patients are older, showed a higher ECOG-PS and more aggressive tumors.
In the cohort PSA decreased about 98.1%, 74% of patients showed a PSA decrease over 90% and 54.8% reached a PSA-level < 0.2ng/ml.
Apalutamide was well tolerated in real world patients: adverse events occurred in 67.7% but were in the majority mild (≥ grade 3: 6.5%).
Dose reduction was necessary in 38.7% and 32.2% discontinued apalutamide treatment.
MFS was 43 months and majority of patients were subsequently treated with abiraterone.
In real world more comorbid nmCRPC patients with a higher ECOG-PS and more aggressive tumors are treated with apalutamide plus ADT.
Nevertheless efficacy results as well as side effects are similar in real-world compared to Spartan trial showing also a rapid, durable and deep PSA response with a median MFS of 43 months.
