A compelling hypothesis about attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) etiopathogenesis is that the ADHD phenotype reflects a delay in cortical maturation.
Slow-wave activity (SWA) of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) is an electrophysiological index of sleep intensity reflecting cortical maturation.
Available data on ADHD and SWA are conflicting, and developmental differences, or the effect of pharmacological treatment, are relatively unknown.
We examined, in samples (Mage = 16.4, SD = 1.2), of ever-medicated adolescents at risk for ADHD (n = 18; 72% boys), medication-naïve adolescents at risk for ADHD (n = 15, 67% boys), and adolescents not at risk for ADHD (n = 31, 61% boys) matched for chronological age and controlling for non-ADHD pharmacotherapy, whether ADHD pharmacotherapy modulates the association between NREM SWA and ADHD risk in home sleep.
Findings indicated medication-naïve adolescents at risk for ADHD exhibited greater first sleep cycle and entire night NREM SWA than both ever-medicated adolescents at risk for ADHD and adolescents not at risk for ADHD and no difference between ever-medicated, at-risk adolescents, and not at-risk adolescents.
Results support atypical cortical maturation in medication-naïve adolescents at risk for ADHD that appears to be normalized by ADHD pharmacotherapy in ever-medicated adolescents at risk for ADHD.
Greater NREM SWA may reflect a compensatory mechanism in middle-later adolescents at risk for ADHD that normalizes an earlier occurring developmental delay.
