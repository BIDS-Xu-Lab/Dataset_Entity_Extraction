An inherited deficiency of arylsulfatase A (ASA) causes the lysosomal storage disease metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) characterized by massive intralysosomal storage of the acidic glycosphingolipid sulfatide and progressive demyelination.
Lyso-sulfatide, which differs from sulfatide by the lack of the N-linked fatty acid, also accumulates in MLD and is considered a key driver of pathology although its concentrations are far below sulfatide levels.
However, the metabolic origin of lyso-sulfatide is unknown.
We show here that ASA-deficient murine macrophages and microglial cells express an endo-N-deacylase that cleaves the N-linked fatty acid from sulfatide.
An ASA-deficient astrocytoma cell line devoid of this activity was used to identify the enzyme by overexpressing 13 deacylases with potentially matching substrate specificities.
Hydrolysis of sulfatide was detected only in cells overexpressing the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH).
A cell-free assay with recombinant FAAH confirmed the novel role of this enzyme in sulfatide hydrolysis.
Consistent with the inÂ vitro data, deletion of FAAH lowered lyso-sulfatide levels in a mouse model of MLD.
Regardless of the established cytotoxicity of lyso-sulfatide and the anti-inflammatory effects of FAAH inhibition seen in mouse models of several neurological diseases, genetic inactivation of FAAH did not mitigate, but rather exacerbated the disease phenotype of MLD mice.
This unexpected finding was reflected by worsening of rotarod performance, increase of anxiety-related exploratory activity, aggravation of peripheral neuropathy, and reduced life expectancy.
Thus, we conclude that FAAH has a protective function in MLD and may represent a novel therapeutic target for treatment of this fatal condition.
