The potential health and environmental hazards of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been a concerned issue.
However, in contrast to the wide recognition of the toxicity of CNTs, little attention has been paid to the decontamination/remediation of CNT pollution.
In this study, we report that CNTs can be removed from aqueous environment.
In the presence of Ca²(+), CNTs aggregate quickly to micron size and then enable easy and effective removal via normal filtration.
After filtration, CNT suspension becomes colorless with the remnant CNT concentration less than 0.5 μg mL⁻¹, a safe dose based on the published data.
The filtration approach also works well in the presence of typical surfactant and dissolved organic matter.
The removal efficiency is Ca²(+) concentration-dependent and regulated by the initial pH value and ionic strength.
Our study is helpful for future decontamination of CNTs from aqueous environment.
