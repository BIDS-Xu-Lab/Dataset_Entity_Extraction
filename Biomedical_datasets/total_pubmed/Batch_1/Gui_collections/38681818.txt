Contextual events are recognized to affect seizure-like behaviors, yet there is limited research on procedures assessing contextual control.
This study aimed to examine the utilization of a brief experimental precursor functional analysis within a clinical team assessment.
Furthermore, the study explored if telehealth supervision could guide a parent administered replication of the functional analysis.
The participants were a young female with Rett syndrome and a history of epilepsy as well as non-epileptic seizures and her mother.
The functional analysis procedures consisted of the systematic alternations of contextual conditions that were hypothesized to either prevent or evoke seizure-like behaviors.
The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of behavioral precursors that were identified to consequently signal subsequent seizure-like behaviors.
In addition, procedure fidelity and interobserver agreement data were obtained alongside parent rating of the procedure's social validity.
The clinical functional analysis clearly suggested that the seizure-like behaviors served the function of access to attention and preferred activities.
A parent administered functional analysis replicated clinical functional analysis findings.
The parent's fidelity to procedures was high and scores in social validity were excellent.
The results show that functional analysis procedures could provide essential information in assessment of non-epileptic seizures.
