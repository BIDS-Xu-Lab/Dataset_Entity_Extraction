With the unique mimicry of the sensory experiences of meats, the plant-based meat alternatives (PBMA) appeal to consumers outside the traditional vegetarian demographics.
This study analyzes market expenditure data from 2017 to 2020 to evaluate the demand for PBMA in relation to meats.
Results show that PBMA is a complement for beef and pork while a substitute for chicken, turkey, and fish.
Although the current market demand for PBMA is still incomparable with meats, the growth of PBMA sales is significant.
This study sheds light on marketing strategies and policies towards the future of PBMA and the fresh meat sector.
