To describe end-stage renal disease (ESRD) quality of care (receipt of pre-ESRD nephrology care, access to kidney transplantation, and placement of permanent vascular access for dialysis) in US patients with ESRD due to lupus nephritis (LN-ESRD) and to examine whether quality measures differ by patient sociodemographic characteristics or US region.
National surveillance data on patients in the US in whom treatment for LN-ESRD was initiated between July 2005 and September 2011 (n = 6,594) were analyzed.
Odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were determined for each quality measure, according to sociodemographic factors and US region.
Overall, 71% of the patients received nephrology care prior to ESRD.
[95% CI 0.29-0.44]) were less likely than those with private insurance to be placed on the waitlist.
ESRD quality-of-care measures varied 2-3-fold across regions of the US, with patients in the Northeast and Northwest generally having higher probabilities of adequate care.
LN-ESRD patients have suboptimal ESRD care, particularly with regard to placement of dialysis vascular access.
Minority race/ethnicity and lack of private insurance are associated with inadequate ESRD care.
Further studies are warranted to examine multilevel barriers to, and develop targeted interventions to improve delivery of, care among patients with LN-ESRD.
