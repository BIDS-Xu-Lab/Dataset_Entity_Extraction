Extreme bradycardia, extreme tachycardia, ventricular flutter fib, and ventricular tachycardia are four malignant arrhythmias (MAs) that lead to sudden cardiac death.
It is very important to detect them in daily life.
The arterial blood pressure (ABP) signal contains abundant pathological information about four MAs and is easy to be recorded under domestic conditions.
Thus, a synthesis-by-analysis (SA) modeling method for ABP signal was proposed to detect the four MAs in this study.
The average models of MAs and healthy subjects were obtained by SA modeling, and the change of each ABP wave was quantitively described by twelve parameters of wave models.
Then, the probabilistic neural network (PNN) and random forest (RF) are trained to detect the MAs.
The experimental data were employed from Fantasia and the 2015 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge databases.
The SA modeling results show that some pathological and physiological changes could be extracted from the average models.
The two-sample ks-test results between different groups are markedly different (h = 1, p < 0.05).
The detection results show that the performances of PPN classifiers are less than that of RF.
The kappa coefficients (KC) for the RF classifiers are 97.167 ± 1.46 %, 97.888 ± 0.808 %, 99.895 ± 0.545 %, 98.575 ± 1.683 % and 92.241 ± 1.517 %, respectively.
Compared to the performance of some existing studies, the proposed method has better performance and is potential to diagnose MAs in m-health.
