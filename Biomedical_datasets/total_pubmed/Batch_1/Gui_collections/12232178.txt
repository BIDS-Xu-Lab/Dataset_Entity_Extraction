Cultured pear (Pyrus communis L. cv Passe Crassane) cells were subjected to temperatures of 39, 42, and 45[deg]C. Heat-shock protein (hsp) synthesis was greater at 30[deg]C than at temperatures above 40[deg]C and continued for up to 8 h. Both cellular uptake of radiolabeled methionine and total protein synthesis were progressively lower as the temperature was increased.
Polysome levels decreased immediately when cells were placed at 39 or 42[deg]C, although at 39[deg]C the levels began to recover after 1 h. In cells from both temperatures, reassembly occurred after transfer of cells to 25[deg]C Four heat-shock-related mRNAs[mdash]hsp17, hsp70, and those of two ubiquitin genes[mdash]all showed greatest abundance at 39[deg]C and decreased at higher temperatures.
Protein degradation increased with time at 42 and 45[deg]C, but at 39[deg]C it increased for the first 2 h and then decreased.
In the presence of cycloheximide, which prevented hsp synthesis, protein degradation at 39[deg]C was as great as that at 45[deg]C in the absence of cycloheximide.
The data suggest that hsps may have a role in protecting proteins from degradation at the permissive temperature of 39[deg]C. At temperatures high enough to inhibit hsp synthesis, protein degradation was enhanced.
Although ubiquitin may play a role in specific protein degradation, it does not appear to be involved in increased protein degradation occurring above 40[deg]C.
