Complex interrelationships exist between the right (RV) and the left ventricles (LV).
Therefore, in 30 consecutive patients with reduced LV function (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]) less than 40% undergoing myocardial revascularization, RV hemodynamics were studied from the beginning of anesthesia until the end of the operation.
The data were compared with 30 consecutive patients with normal LVEF (greater than 70%).
Ventricular function was assessed during left heart catheterization, which was carried out within 1 month of the operation.
In addition to standard hemodynamic variables, RV ejection fraction (RVEF), RV end-diastolic volume (RVEDV), and RV end-systolic volume (RVESV) were monitored by the thermodilution technique.
The two groups did not differ preoperatively with regard to RVEF, pressure (MAP, PAP, PCWP, RAP, RVPsyst, RVEDP), cardiac index (CI), and volume variables (RVESV, RVEDV).
However, when the group with preoperatively reduced LVEF was subdivided into patients with severely reduced LVEF (less than 30%; n = 14; mean value 25.1%) and patients with moderately reduced LVEF (30%-40%; n = 16; mean value 37.3%), RVEF was significantly lower in the patients with a LVEF below 30% throughout the entire investigation period.
RVEDV and RVESV were significantly higher in these patients.
In conjunction with the lower RVEF and normal PAP, this suggests reduced RV function.
It can be concluded that a severely reduced preoperative LVEF (less than 30%) may also be associated with impaired RV function.
