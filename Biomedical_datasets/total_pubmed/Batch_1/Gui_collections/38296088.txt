Exposure to indoor air pollution (IAP) is a leading environmental risk for respiratory diseases.
We investigated the relationship between respiratory symptoms and polluting indoor activities such as smoking, cooking and contact with pets among children in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam.
A cross-sectional survey applied a multistage sampling method in 24 randomly selected secondary schools across the city.
Approximately 15,000 students completed self-administrated questionnaires on risk factors and respiratory health outcomes within the preceding 12 months.
Data were analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression model with robust standard errors.
Wheeze was the most common respiratory symptom (39.5 %) reported, followed by sneezing and runny nose (28.3 %).
A small percentage of students self-reported asthma (8.6 %).
Approximately 56 % of participants lived with family members who smoked.
A positive association between exposure to indoor secondhand smoke and respiratory symptoms was observed, with adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of 1.41 (95 % CI: 1.25-1.60, p < 0.001) for wheezing and 1.64 (95 % CI: 1.43-1.87, p < 0.001) for sneezing and runny nose, respectively.
Using an open stove fuelled by coal, wood, or kerosene for cooking was associated with wheeze (aOR: 1.36, CI 95 %: 1.10-1.68, p = 0.01) and sneezing and runny nose (aOR: 1.36, CI 95 %: 1.09-1.69, p = 0.01).
In the present study, IAP was associated with adverse health outcomes, as evidenced by an increase in respiratory symptoms reported within the previous 12 months.
