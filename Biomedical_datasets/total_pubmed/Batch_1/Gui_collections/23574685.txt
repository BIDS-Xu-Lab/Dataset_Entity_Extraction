The distribution and co-morbidity of common psychiatric disorders can be largely explained as manifestations of two broad psychopathological spectra of internalizing and externalizing disorders.
Twin studies suggest that these spectra arise from genetic factors.
Structural equation twin modeling was applied to interview and questionnaire data on personality traits and lifetime psychiatric disorders on more than 5300 members of male-male (MM) and female-female (FF) twin pairs.
The best-fitting models for both the externalizing and internalizing spectra differed significantly in males and females.
In males, the externalizing genetic common factor was best indexed by four disorders in the following order: antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), drug abuse/dependence (DAD), alcohol abuse dependence (AAD) and conduct disorder (CD).
In females, the four disorders most closely related to the externalizing common factor were, in order: DAD, AAD, nicotine dependence (ND) and ASPD.
Personality traits of novelty seeking (NS) and extraversion (E) better indexed the genetic externalizing spectrum in females than in males.
In both males and females, major depression (MD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) best indexed the genetic internalizing common factor.
Panic disorder (PD) and agoraphobia (AgP) better reflected the internalizing genetic common factor in women, and neuroticism (N) in men.
Genetic correlations between the two spectra were estimated at + 0.53 in males and + 0.52 in females.
The disorders that optimally index the genetic liability to externalizing and internalizing disorders in the general population differ meaningfully in men and women.
In both sexes, these genetic spectra are better assessed by psychiatric disorders than by personality traits.
