To investigate the effect of different concentrations of fluoride on the expression of endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, and to explore the mechanism of dental fluorosis in rat.
Thirty Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups.
Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of CRT, GRP78, XBP-1 and caspase-12 in rat incisors.
Metamorph microscope images analysis system and SPSS 13.0 software package was used to analyze the data.
Typical features of dental fluorosis were found in the fluoride group.
Results of immunohistochemistry showed that CRT (F=238.6, P<0.05), GRP78 (F=27.42, P<0.05), XBP-1 (F=139.7, P<0.05) and caspase-12 (F=43.91, P<0.05) were significantly different among the 3 groups.
Excessive fluoride can increase the secretion of CRT, GRP78, XBP-1 and caspase-12 suggest the ameloblasts and in status of endoplasmic reticulum stress and caspase-12 plays an important role during ameloblast apoptosis.
