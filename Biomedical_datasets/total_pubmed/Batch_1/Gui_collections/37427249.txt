In low- and middle-income countries, pharmaceutical compounding is vital to provide high-quality healthcare service.
Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate the extent status of practice and barriers to compounding services in hospital and community pharmacies of Southwest Ethiopia.
A healthcare institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 15 September 2021 to 25 January 2022.
Data were collected from 104 pharmacists using a self-administered questionnaire.
The responding pharmacists were selected by purposive sampling technique.
Finally, descriptive statistical methods were used for data analysis with the help of IBM SPSS Statistics V21.0.
A total of 104 pharmacists (27 hospital pharmacists and 77 community pharmacists) responded (response rate: 0.945).
Besides providing other routine essential pharmacy services, around 93.3% of contacted pharmacies have a history of practicing compounding services.
The most common practices were granule or powder reconstitution to suspensions or solutions (98.97%) and crushing tablets into smaller forms (92.8%).
Commonly, compounding was requested and practiced for preparing pediatrics (97.9%) and geriatrics (96.9%) doses from adult doses, unavailable dosage forms (88.7%), and solving therapeutic gaps (86.6%).
All compounding pharmacies participated in compounding antimicrobial medications.
They often cited lacking skills or training (76.3%) and insufficient equipment and supplies needed for compounding (99%) as the main barriers.
With many facilitators, challenges, and limitations, medication compounding services remain one of the core healthcare services.
Areas needing improvement include strengthening comprehensive and continuous professional development for pharmacists on compounding standards.
