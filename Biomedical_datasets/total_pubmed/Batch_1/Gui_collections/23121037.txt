We have investigated the involvement of glucocorticoid on methamphetamine (MA) induced hyperpyrexia using a bio-telemetric system.
A significant level of hyperpyrexia was observed in MA administered rats.
In contrast, increase of body temperature was suppressed by adrenalectomy or by the administration of RU-486, an antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor.
These data suggest that the glucocorticoid receptor may be involved in hyperpyrexia induced by MA.
methamphetamine - hyperpyrexia - glucocorticoid - corticosterone.
