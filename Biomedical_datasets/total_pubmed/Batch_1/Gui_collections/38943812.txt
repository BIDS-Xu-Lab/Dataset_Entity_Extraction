This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of ovarian endometriomas (OMA) on indirect markers of oocyte quality in patients undergoing IVF, compared with women without anatomical or functional ovarian abnormalities.
The search spanned original randomized controlled trials, case-control studies and cohort studies published in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and the ClinicalTrials.gov database up to October 2023.
Thirty-one studies were included in the meta-analysis, showing no significant differences in fertilization (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.94-1.30), blastulation (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64-1.14) and cancellation (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.78-1.44) rates.
However, patients with OMA exhibited significantly lower numbers of total and mature (metaphase II) oocytes retrieved (mean difference -1.59, 95% CI -2.25 to -0.94; mean difference -1.86, 95% CI -2.46 to -1.26, respectively), and lower numbers of top-quality embryos (mean difference -0.49, 95% CI -0.92 to -0.06).
The Ovarian Sensitivity Index was similar between the groups (mean difference -1.55, 95% CI -3.27 to 0.18).
The lack of data published to date prevented meta-analysis on euploidy rate.
In conclusion, although the presence of OMA could decrease the oocyte yield in patients undergoing IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection, it does not appear to have an adverse impact on oocyte quality.
