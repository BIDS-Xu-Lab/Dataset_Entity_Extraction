To investigate the unmet needs for rehabilitation services among middle-aged and older adults in Chengdu, Sichuan, China, and identify the associated factors.
This cross-sectional study was conducted on middle-aged and older adults in Chengdu, Sichuan, China, between 2015 and 2016.
The questionnaire included demographic data and questions about rehabilitation needs.
Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify the associated factors of unmet needs for rehabilitation services.
Among 663 participants, 91.70% needed medical rehabilitation (608/663), 26.55% of who need auxiliary equipment (176/663), 77.07% of who need daily care and social participation (511/663), and 79.34% of who need recreational therapy activities (526/663), while < 30% required auxiliary equipment.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that residents who were married, had annual income < CNY 80,000, had no medical insurance, had three or more health problems, were aged ≥ 60, and the disability status were independently associated with unmet needs for rehabilitation services (all P < 0.05).
Marital status, annual income, medical insurance, health problems, and disability might be factors independently associated with the unmet needs for rehabilitation services.
Attention should be paid to the financial burden of the population on rehabilitation services, and in addition to the disabled, the slow patients should also be given priority.
