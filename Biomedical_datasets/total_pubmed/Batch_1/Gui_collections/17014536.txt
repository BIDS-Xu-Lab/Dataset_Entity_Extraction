A community development oral health promotion programme based on the principles of the Ottawa Charter was conducted in an attempt to improve the dental health of children under 5 years of age in two severely socioeconomically challenged pilot districts in Glasgow, UK.
Later phased extension involved all of the area's most deprived communities.
The aim of the present study was to assess dental health outcomes by secondary analysis of routine caries datasets for Glasgow 5-year-olds over the interval from 1997-1998 to 2003-2004.
Wilcoxon tests assessed change in d3mft scores and logistic regression was used to analyse binomial scores (e.g. % d3mft = 0).
[P = 0.010, odds ratio (OR) = 0.25, and P = 0.006, OR = 0.30, respectively, for d3mft > 0].
Following extension of the programme into all of Glasgow's socioeconomically challenged areas, the mean d3mft values of 5-year-olds reduced in all DepCat 7 communities, and across Glasgow as a whole from 4.9 to 4.1 and from 3.5 to 3.1, respectively, while the proportion with d3mft = 0 increased from 20% to 32% (P < 0.001) and from 34% to 42% (P < 0.001), respectively.
Dental health improvements were observed in pilot districts and across all DepCat 7 communities following the roll-out of the programme.
This change was of sufficient magnitude to impact upon area-wide statistics for Glasgow.
