Postoperative patients with lung cancer have a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis; hence, it was aimed to identify the factors affecting hope to develop a care-oriented perspective that focuses on the levels of hope of postoperative patients with lung cancer.
In the study, postoperative patients with lung cancer were included and data were collected for treatment-related symptoms, coping, and support-related factors as the primary variables.
The Herth Hope Index, Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer Module of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Japanese version of the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations, and Social Support Scale for Cancer Patients were used.
For the 82 patients that were included in this study, 55% of the variance in the level of hope was explained by using a model that included the following: (i) symptoms of dyspnea, sore mouth, and chest pain; (ii) support, including satisfaction with postoperative symptom control by healthcare providers, satisfaction with the amount of information provided by healthcare providers, and the level of trust in the nurses during treatment and recovery; and (iii) task-oriented and social diversion coping behaviors.
As a result of this study, the support-related factors had no direct influence on hope, but they did have a significantly negative influence on the treatment-related symptoms, with improved symptoms also influencing hope.
