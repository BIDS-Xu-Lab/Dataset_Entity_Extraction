This is the first English translation of the work Periodic phenomena in the sleep in children, published in 1926 in the Journal Novoe v refleksologii i fiziologii nervnoi sistemy (Vol. 2, pp. 338-345) by Maria Denisova and Nicholai Figurin; it is the first study to report data on what is currently termed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.
The authors acquired continuous quantitative respiration data, as well as, eye and body movements during sleep in children for up to 6 hours, and discovered several novel features of sleep cycles in healthy infants from birth to about 1 year of age.
First, the study reports cyclical periods of increased respiration and eye and body movements, with rapid ocular movements visible under relaxed eyelids (separation: 0.5-1 mm).
These observations suggest atonia of REM sleep.
Second, the length of the complete cycle (alternating active and quiet sleep phases or states) is about 50 minutes, an estimate that is consistent with later work.
Third, the study identifies infant-specific ordering of sleep states, with the active phase beginning after sleep onset, followed by the quiescence phase.
Importantly, these published data on sleep cycles precede all published studies related to the state now termed REM sleep by about 30 years (i.e. publishing in Science and in the Journal of Applied Physiology in the 1950s by Eugene Aserinski and Nathaniel Kleitman).
In the historical commentary accompanying this translation, the findings of those later works are carefully compared to the original data on respiration and ocular and body motility cycles during sleep in infants, first reported and published by Denisova and Figurin (1926).
