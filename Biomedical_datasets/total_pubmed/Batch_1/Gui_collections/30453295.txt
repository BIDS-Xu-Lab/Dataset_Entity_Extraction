The common thread running through all forms of sexual objectification is the experience of being treated as a body (or collection of body parts) valued predominantly for its use to (or consumption by) others.
If girls and women adopt a peculiar view of the self, an effect called self-objectification, this may contribute to depression, sexual dysfunction, and eating disorders.
The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of modesty (in terms of veiling, i.e., hijab) on objectification, by others and by the self, body image, and behaviors indicative of eating disturbance in veiled and unveiled Muslim women in Kuwait.
This is a community-based, cross-sectional study conducted through an online survey.
The respondents were females living in Kuwait.
Unveiled women experienced more objectification by others than veiled women.
There were no significant differences found between veiled and unveiled women in self-objectification and eating disorder symptomatology.
There is a significant negative relationship between modesty of clothing and objectification by others.
No significant relationship was found between modesty of clothing and the self-objectification and eating disorder scales.
For the objectification by others scale, data show that there is a positive relationship between this scale and eating disorders.
Eating disorders were found to have a negative relationship with self-objectification.
The results of the study are significant as they clearly demonstrate a weak negative relationship between clothing preferences/affiliations and eating disorders.
