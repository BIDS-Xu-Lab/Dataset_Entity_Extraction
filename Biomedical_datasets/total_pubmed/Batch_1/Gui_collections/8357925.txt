Pathologic study of the ear was performed on 179 young swine, ranging in age from 1 day to 18.6 weeks.
Histologically, eustachitis was the most common and its inflammatory reaction appeared to precede otitis.
Immunohistochemically, Mycoplasma hyorhinis (Mhr) antigens were detected on the luminal surface of the auditory epithelia in 19 of 179 cases (10.6%).
All the cases, positive for Mhr antigens, were associated with an acute eustachitis.
Ultrastructural examination of two piglets confirmed these immunohistochemical data.
The present results indicate that Mhr may be a primary cause of acute eustachitis in young swine.
