Emerging evidence suggests that highly treatment-resistant tumour-initiating cells (TICs) play a central role in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer.
Tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is considered to be a novel anticancer agent; however, recent studies have shown that many pancreatic cancer cells are resistant to apoptosis induction by TRAIL due to TRAIL-activated nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signalling.
Several chemopreventive agents are able to inhibit NF-kappaB, and favourable results have been obtained--for example, for the broccoli compound sulforaphane-in preventing metastasis in clinical studies.
The aim of the study was to identify TICs in pancreatic carcinoma for analysis of resistance mechanisms and for definition of sensitising agents.
TICs were defined by expression patterns of a CD44(+)/CD24(-), CD44(+)/CD24(+) or CD44(+)/CD133(+) phenotype and correlation to growth in immunodeficient mice, differentiation grade, clonogenic growth, sphere formation, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity and therapy resistance.
Mechanistically, specific binding of transcriptionally active cRel-containing NF-kappaB complexes in TICs was observed.
Sulforaphane prevented NF-kappaB binding, downregulated apoptosis inhibitors and induced apoptosis, together with prevention of clonogenicity.
Gemcitabine, the chemopreventive agents resveratrol and wogonin, and the death ligand TRAIL were less effective.
In a xenograft model, sulforaphane strongly blocked tumour growth and angiogenesis, while combination with TRAIL had an additive effect without obvious cytotoxicity in normal cells.
Freshly isolated patient tumour cells expressing markers for TICs could be sensitised by sulforaphane for TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity.
The data provide new insights into resistance mechanisms of TICs and suggest the combination of sulforaphane with TRAIL as a promising strategy for targeting of pancreatic TICs.
