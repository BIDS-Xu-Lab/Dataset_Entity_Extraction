scyllo-inositol dehydrogenase, isolated from Paracoccus laeviglucosivorans (Pl-sIDH), exhibits a broad substrate specificity: it oxidizes scyllo- and myo-inositols as well as L-glucose, converting L-glucose to L-glucono-1,5-lactone.
Based on the crystal structures previously reported, Arg178 residue, located at the entry port of the catalytic site, seemed to be important for accepting substrates.
Here, we report the role of Arg178 by using an alanine-substituted mutant for kinetic analysis as well as to determine the crystal structures.
The wild-type Pl-sIDH exhibits the activity for scyllo-inositol most preferably followed by myo-inositol and L-glucose.
On the contrary, the R178A mutant abolished the activities for both inositols, but remained active for L-glucose to the same extent as its wild-type.
Based on the crystal structures of the mutant, the side chain of Asp191 flipped out of the substrate binding site.
Therefore, Arg178 is important in positioning Asp191 correctly to exert its catalytic activities.
