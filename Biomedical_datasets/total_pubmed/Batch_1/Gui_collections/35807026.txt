Psoriatic disease is a chronic inflammatory disease that is associated with morbidity and a poor quality of life.
However, studies on the trends of psoriatic disease incidence are limited.
We examined trends in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis from 2002 to 2016 in Taiwan and distinguished the effects of age, period, and cohort on those trends.
Data from the National Health Insurance Research Database were analyzed for the annual incidence of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
An age-period-cohort model was designed in order to investigate the effects of each age, period, and birth cohort on the incidence.
From 2002 to 2016, the incidence of psoriasis significantly decreased from 43.33 to 23.14 per 100,000 persons.
The incidence of psoriatic arthritis significantly increased from 3.57 to 5.22 per 100,000 persons.
In the age-period-cohort analysis, the net age effect on the incidence of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis increased with advancing age (6-fold and 7.7-fold difference, respectively).
The age-period-cohort analysis revealed that the incidence of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis is associated with older age and early birth cohorts.
Elderly individuals in Taiwan may be at a higher risk of developing new-onset psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
