HeLa cells are widely used for all kinds of in vitro studies in biochemistry, biology and medicine.
Knowledge on protein expression is limited and no comprehensive study on the proteome of this cell type has been reported so far.
We applied proteomics technologies to analyze the proteins of the HeLa cell line.
The proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MS) on the basis of peptide mass fingerprinting, following in-gel digestion with trypsin.
Approximately 3000 spots, excised from six two-dimensional gels, were analyzed.
The analysis resulted in the identification of about 1200 proteins that were the products of 297 different genes.
The HeLa cell database includes proteins with important functions and unknown functions, representing today one of the largest two-dimensional databases for eukaryotic proteomes and forming the basis for future expressional studies at the protein level.
