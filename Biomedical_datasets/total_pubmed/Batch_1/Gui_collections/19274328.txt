The reaction of the flavonol 3,7,3', 4'-tetra-O-methylquercetin (1) and of the isoflavone 7,4'-di-O-methylgenistein (2) with alkaline iodine in methanol afforded four new iodine derivatives: 8-iodo-5-hydroxy-3,7,3', 4'-tetramethoxy- flavone (1a) and 6-iodo-5-hydroxy-3,7,3', 4'-tetramethoxyflavone (1b) from 1; 2 afforded a mixture of two compounds, identified as a racemic mixture of (+/-)-trans-5-hydroxy-2,3,7,4'-tetramethoxy-8-iodo-isoflavanone (2a) and (+/-)-trans-5-hydroxy-2,3,7,4'-tetramethoxy-6,8-diiodo-isoflavanone (2b).
The formation of these different products reveals a significant difference involving the chemical interaction between the reactive site of alpha, beta-unsaturated ketones of flavonol and isoflavone under the tested reaction conditions (using I2/KOH/MeOH).
Furthermore, the trans stereo selectivity is noteworthy in the nucleophylic addition of methanol at the isoflavone alpha, beta-unsaturated system.
The structures were identified on the basis of spectral data, mainly 1D and 2D NMR and mass spectra.
