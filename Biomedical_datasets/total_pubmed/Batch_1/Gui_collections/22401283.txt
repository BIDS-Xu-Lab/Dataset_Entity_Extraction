Males born preterm are at greater risk of illness and death than females, principally due to respiratory disease.
Much of the excess morbidity occurs within the first few hours of life.
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether or not differences in the cardiopulmonary transition soon after birth underlie the increased morbidity in males after preterm birth.
Nine female and thirteen male lambs (128Â±2 days gestation) underwent surgery immediately before delivery for implantation of a pulmonary arterial flow-probe and catheters into the main pulmonary artery and a carotid artery.
After birth lambs were ventilated for 30 min (tidal volume 7 mL kg(-1)) while anaesthetised.
Arterial pressures and flows were recorded in real time and left-ventricular output measured using Doppler echocardiography.
Before birth, fetal cardiopulmonary haemodynamics, arterial blood gases, pH, glucose and lactate did not differ between sexes.
Similarly, in the neonatal period there were no significant differences in arterial blood gas status, ventilation parameters, respiratory indices or cardiopulmonary haemodynamics between the sexes.
Our data show that the cardiopulmonary transition at birth in ventilated, anaesthetised preterm lambs is not influenced by sex.
Thus, the neonatal 'male disadvantage' is not explained by an impaired cardiovascular transition at birth.
