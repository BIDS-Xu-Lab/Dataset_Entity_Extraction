The quantitative metabolic profiles of volatilizable components of human biological fluids, particularly urinary organic acids, is reviewed, with emphasis on the use of gas-chromatography/mass spectrometer/computer systems.
Various definitions of metabolic profiling are considered and techniques for obtaining such profiles are discussed.
The role of computer processing of such data is examined, and statistical techniques for treating quantitative metabolic profiles are suggested.
