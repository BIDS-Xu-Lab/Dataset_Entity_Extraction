The association between internal cadmium exposure and chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been investigated before.
However, few studies have shown the association between dietary cadmium intake and CKD.
In this study, we show the association between life-time dietary cadmium intake and CKD based on a follow-up study.
At baseline, we collected blood and urine samples for assays of cadmium and renal effect biomarkers.
A questionnaire and food survey was given to each subject to collect diet and lifestyle information for the estimation of cadmium intake.
Dietary cadmium, cadmium in blood and urine were regarded as exposure markers.
Life-time dietary cadmium intake was estimated based on an individual's daily cadmium intake and exposure time.
At follow-up, 467 persons (163 men and 304 women) were finally included.
CKD at follow-up was considered if the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.
The eGFR level in subjects in the highest quartile of total dietary cadmium intake (>9.34 g) was significantly lower than in those with a moderate or low intake (p < 0.01).
eGFR was negatively associated with total dietary cadmium intake (β = -0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.77 to -0.07) after adjustment with confounders.
Logistic regression further showed that the risk of CKD in subjects with a high total dietary cadmium intake (>2.2 g) was higher than in those with a low intake (odds ratio (OR) = 18.16, 95%CI: 1.75-188.85).
A similar association was found between the baseline urinary albumin (UALB) level and CKD incidence.
A predictive model based on UALB and life-time dietary cadmium intake showed an acceptable performance (the area under the curve was 0.77 (95%CI: 0.65-0.88)).
Our data show that high dietary cadmium exposure was associated with CKD after controlling for renal tubular dysfunction and internal cadmium exposure.
