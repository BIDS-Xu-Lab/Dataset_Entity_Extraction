Ethanol is bactericidal against most pathogens implicated in central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) and biofilms.
Current Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines cite insufficient evidence to support adjunctive ethanol-lock therapy (ELT) for central venous catheter (CVC) salvage in patients with CLABSI in combination with systemic antimicrobial treatment.
We evaluated the safety and potential efficacy of 70% ELT for CLABSI at our institution after implementation of a hospital ELT protocol.
We collected data on all patients treated with adjunctive 70% ELT for catheter salvage from September 2009 to September 2011 and assessed clinical outcomes and adverse events associated with ELT.
Sixty-eight hospitalized patients received 70% ELT for CVC salvage: 45 (66%) met the criteria for CLABSI.
Five (11%) had persistent or recurrent bacteraemia triggering CVC removal; 28 (62%) preserved their CVC long term.
There were no documented adverse events associated with ELT.
Adjunctive 70% ELT is an inexpensive, well-tolerated option for CVC salvage in patients with CLABSI and warrants further investigation.
