In 2005, the first evidence-based German guideline on the management of early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was published.
With data from the national database of the German Collaborative Arthritis Centres and other health care studies we evaluated to what extent current health care is in accordance with the guideline's recommendations.
A total of 66% of all newly referred RA patients seen at the national database centers in 2008 achieved the goal of seeing a rheumatologist within 3 months of symptom onset, while 75% were seen within 6 months.
Before referral, 25% of the patients had DMARD therapy and 19% glucocorticoids.
Of the patients in rheumatological care, 90% received DMARDs.
The availability of early arthritis clinics determines the promptness of access to a rheumatologist.
After 6 years of rheumatological care, around 80% of patients continuously seen were still under treatment with a conventional or biological DMARD.
The highest continuation rates were seen for methotrexate monotherapy.
Biologic agents were given in 2008 to 20% of patients.
Of those with "severe" or "very severe" disease, 42% received biologics and 21% DMARD combination therapy.
Low-dose glucocorticoids are the standard of care; of patients in rheumatological care, 88% received dosages up to 7.5 mg/d and 74% of up to 5 mg/d.
