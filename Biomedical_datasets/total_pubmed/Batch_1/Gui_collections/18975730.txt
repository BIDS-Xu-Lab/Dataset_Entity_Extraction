This quantitative research study assesses the organizational characteristics, market factors, and profitability of US hospitals that operate joint ventures with other health care organizations.
Data was obtained from the 2001 American Hospital Association annual survey, the Area Resource File, and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Minimum Data Set.
These data files provide essential information on individual acute care hospitals, the communities they serve, and the level of financial performance.
Descriptive statistics were evaluated and a logistic regression model was utilized to examine hospitals operating joint ventures.
The study found hospitals that operate joint ventures are located in communities with more elderly patients, lower unemployment, and lower HMO penetration.
From an operating performance perspective, hospitals that operate joint ventures have a higher occupancy rate, a higher average length of stay, more clinical services, lower long-term debt, and a greater number of managed care contracts.
The results also appear to indicate that joint ventures have a positive financial impact on US hospitals.
The study has managerial implications supporting the use of joint ventures to improve hospital performance and policy implications on resource allocation.
