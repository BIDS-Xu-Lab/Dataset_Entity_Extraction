The working party was established by the Council of The British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry in response to health circular HC(89)2 and its equivalents in areas other than England, to consider the information necessary to monitor the dental health of adult populations and for planning local dental services.
Recommendations are made as to the type of information required and its availability.
A key issue is the definition of local geographical units suitable for planning purpose.
Effective collaboration between District Health Authorities and Family Health Services Authorities is essential in achieving in agreed approach which is the foundation of a comprehensive information system.
Information for monitoring the dental health of the population and for planning dental services should include data on local demography, the needs, demands and expectations of the population, the local availability of dental services and the distribution of facilities, and the activity of dentists and the uptake of dental care.
It is the view of the working party that much useful information about adult dental health can be obtained from the use of self-reporting questionnaires and that clinical examinations are not generally required.
However there are circumstances which may justify the collection of clinical data and it is desirable that such studies are conducted in a manner which permits comparisons.
Criteria for the standardised clinical assessment of adult dental health have been prepared and it is recommended that these are adopted for general use.
Further research is required to test and validate appropriate questions for inclusion in self reporting studies.
This should lead to the selection of a set of core questions which can be widely used to allow local and regional comparisons of adult dental health.
