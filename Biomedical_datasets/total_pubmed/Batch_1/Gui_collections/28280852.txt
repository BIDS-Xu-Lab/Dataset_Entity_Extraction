Tumor T cell antigens are both diagnostically and therapeutically valuable molecules.
A large number of new peptides are examined as potential tumor epitopes each year, yet there is no infrastructure for storing and accessing the results of these experiments.
We have retroactively cataloged more than 1000 tumor peptides from 368 different proteins, and implemented a web-accessible infrastructure for storing and accessing these experimental results.
All peptides in TANTIGEN are labeled as one of the four categories: (1) peptides measured in vitro to bind the HLA, but not reported to elicit either in vivo or in vitro T cell response, (2) peptides found to bind the HLA and to elicit an in vitro T cell response, (3) peptides shown to elicit in vivo tumor rejection, and (4) peptides processed and naturally presented as defined by physical detection.
In addition to T cell response, we also annotate peptides that are naturally processed HLA binders, e.g., peptides eluted from HLA in mass spectrometry studies.
TANTIGEN provides a rich data resource for tumor-associated epitope and neoepitope discovery studies and is freely available at http://cvc.dfci.harvard.edu/tantigen/ or http://projects.met-hilab.org/tadb (mirror).
