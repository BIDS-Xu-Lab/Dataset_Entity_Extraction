Natural language processing (NLP), a domain of artificial intelligence (AI) that models human language, has been used in medicine to automate diagnostics, detect adverse events, support decision making and predict clinical outcomes.
However, applications to the clinical neurosciences appear to be limited.
NLP has matured with the implementation of deep transformer models (e.g., XLNet, BERT, T5, and RoBERTa) and transfer learning.
The objectives of this study were to (1) systematically review NLP applications in the clinical neurosciences, and (2) explore NLP analysis to facilitate literature synthesis, providing clear examples to demonstrate the potential capabilities of these technologies for a clinical audience.
Our NLP analysis consisted of keyword identification, text summarization and document classification.
A total of 48 articles met inclusion criteria.
NLP has been applied in the clinical neurosciences to facilitate literature synthesis, data extraction, patient identification, automated clinical reporting and outcome prediction.
The number of publications applying NLP has increased rapidly over the past five years.
Document classifiers trained to differentiate included and excluded articles demonstrated moderate performance (XLNet AUC = 0.66, BERT AUC = 0.59, RoBERTa AUC = 0.62).
The T5 transformer model generated acceptable abstract summaries.
The application of NLP has the potential to enhance research and practice in the clinical neurosciences.
