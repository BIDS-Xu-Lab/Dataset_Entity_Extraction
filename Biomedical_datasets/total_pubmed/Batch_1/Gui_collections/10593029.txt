In recent years, many poorer countries have chosen to use disposable instead of sterilizable syringes.
Unfortunately, the infrastructure and management systems that are vital if disposables are to be used safely do not exist.
WHO estimates that up to 30% of injections administered are unsafe.
The traditional sterilizable syringe had many disadvantages, some of which have been minimized through better design and the use of modern materials; others have been overcome because staff are able to demonstrate that they have performed safely.
For example, the time-steam saturation-temperature (TST) indicator has enabled staff to demonstrate that a sterilizing cycle has been successfully completed.
Health facility staff must be able to sterilize equipment, and the sterilizable syringe remains the least costly means of administering an injection.
Data from countries that have acceptable systems for processing clinical waste indicate that safe and environmentally acceptable disposal, destruction and final containment cost nearly as much as the original cost of a disposable syringe.
By careful supervision of staff behaviour and good management, some countries have demonstrated that they are able to administer safe injections with sterilizable syringes at a price they can afford.
