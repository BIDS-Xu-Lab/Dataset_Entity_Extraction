Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is a rare disease with incidence of less than 1%.
MBC present with a larger tumor size, less number of nodes involved, mostly undifferentiated triple negative tumors.
We aimed to determine progression-free and overall survival and reported hospital-based incidence of MBC.
A retrospective closed Cohort study elicited data of 42 patients with MBC from January 2008 to December 2013; followed till August 2016.
Kaplan-Meier method was applied to compute overall and progression-free survival analysis.
Cox Proportional hazard ratios were computed to assess associations between survival and independent variables.
The median age at tumor diagnosis was 54 years (range, 25-81 years).
The most common histopathology was squamous (69%).
The median tumor size was 4.5 cm (range, 0.8-17 cm).
patients had nodal involvement at diagnosis.
Four patients (9.5%) had metastatic disease at presentation.
Hormone receptors were positive in 19 (45.2%) patients.
Her-2 neu receptor was positive in 9 (19%) patients.
Neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy was received by 10 (31.25%) and 19 (45.2%) patients respectively.
Both median progression-free and overall survival was 38 months.
Five-year progression-free and overall survival was 79.5% and 76.3%, respectively.
We report better survival outcomes when compared to series described earlier despite our patient population presenting mostly with high grade, large tumors, and half of them exhibiting nodal and hormonal involvement.
