To examine contextual factors that may facilitate or impede the provision of school health services.
Using a composite database derived primarily from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we used logistic regression to examine how selected characteristics of communities, schools, and state-level policies are related to the provision of specific health services by high schools.
Schools whose students experienced more health risks were generally more likely to provide related services than schools whose students experienced fewer risks.
State policies and requirements for health-related programs and services were associated with greater school-based provision of services.
Availability of health care services within the community was associated with a reduced likelihood that schools provided similar services on-site; however, for some health services, the reverse was true.
In general, more affluent communities were more likely to provide school health services than less affluent communities.
Public schools were more likely to offer health services than private schools.
Certain characteristics of communities, schools, and state-level policies are associated with the provision of school health services.
These contextual factors appear to operate by creating a demand for services and by creating the opportunity for schools to provide health services.
