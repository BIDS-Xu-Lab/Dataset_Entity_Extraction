Infraglenoid tubercle avulsion fractures are extremely rare injuries.
We report a 38-year-old male with glenoid cavity fracture and infraglenoid tubercle avulsion of the left shoulder following a fall from bike.
He refused surgery and was treated nonoperatively.
Follow-up radiography and CT at 18 months revealed a malunited infraglenoid tubercle with signs of early glenohumeral osteoarthritis.
He did not have shoulder instability or pain and had a fair-good functional outcome.
There are no previously published data on the anatomic outcome of nonoperatively treated displaced infraglenoid tubercle avulsion fractures based on CT.
