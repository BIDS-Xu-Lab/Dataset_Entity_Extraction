Two strains of marine, heterotrophic, alkaliphilic bacteria, designated A3F-7(T) and ssthio04PA2-7c, were isolated from hard coral and marine sand, respectively, collected in the Republic of Palau.
A phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the isolates were related to members of the genus Moritella.
However, the sequence similarities between the isolates and the type strains of the Moritella species were less than 93 %.
The G+C contents of the isolates were around 57 mol%, the major respiratory quinone was Q-8 and the predominant cellular fatty acids were 16 : 1omega7c, 16 : 0, 18 : 1omega7c and 14 : 0.
On the basis of the phylogenetic data, phenotypic characteristics and DNA-DNA hybridization results, strains A3F-7(T) and ssthio04PA2-7c represent a novel species of a novel genus, for which the name Paramoritella alkaliphila gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed.
The type strain of Paramoritella alkaliphila is A3F-7(T) (=MBIC06429(T) =DSM 19956(T)).
