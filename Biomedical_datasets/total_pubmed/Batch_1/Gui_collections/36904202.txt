This study aims to explore the interaction between a Chinese version of the Mediterranean-DASH intervention for neurodegenerative delay (cMIND) diet and indoor air pollution and its effect on depression among older adults.
This cohort study used 2011-2018 data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey.
Participants included 2724 adults aged 65 and older without depression.
The Chinese version of the Mediterranean-DASH intervention for neurodegenerative delay (cMIND) diet scores ranged from 0 to 12 based on validated food frequency questionnaire responses.
Depression was measured using the Phenotypes and eXposures Toolkit.
Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to explore the associations, and the analysis was stratified using the cMIND diet scores.
A total of 2724 participants (54.3% males and 45.9% 80 years and older) at baseline were included.
Living with severe indoor pollution was associated with a 40% increase in the risk of depression (HR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.82) compared to living without indoor pollution.
Indoor air pollution exposure was significantly associated with cMIND diet scores.
Participants with a lower cMIND diet score (HR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.24, 2.38) had a greater association with severe pollution than those with a higher cMIND diet score.
The cMIND diet may alleviate depression caused by indoor pollution among older adults.
