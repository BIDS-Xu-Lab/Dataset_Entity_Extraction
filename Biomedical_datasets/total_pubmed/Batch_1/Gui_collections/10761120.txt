Selective compound acquisition programs need to ensure that the compounds that are chosen do not contain undesirable functionality.
This is easy to achieve if a supplier is prepared to provide unambiguous structure representations for the compounds that they have available: this paper discusses selection techniques that can be used when a supplier is prepared to make available only fragment bit-string representations for the compounds in their catalog.
Experiments with three databases and three types of bit-string show that a simple k-nearest-neighbor searching method provides a surprisingly effective, although far from perfect, way of selecting compounds when only bit-string representations are available.
A second approach, based on the use of a fragment weighting scheme analogous to those used in substructural analysis studies, proved to be noticeably less effective in operation.
