Real-world data regarding the use of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in recurrent ovarian cancer patients with non-BRCA homologous recombination (HR) mutations or somatic BRCA mutations are lacking.
The purpose of our study is to evaluate the response rate, duration of treatment, time to progression (TTP), and toxicities of olaparib, niraparib, and rucaparib in somatic BRCAm and non-BRCA HR-mutated patients.
This was a retrospective study using the electronic medical record to identify patients across our health system who were initiated on a PARP inhibitor for ovarian cancer between December 2014 and December 2019.
Patients were screened for the presence of a somatic BRCA1/2 mutation or a mutation in non-BRCA HR genes.
Data were collected via chart review.
For the efficacy analysis, 8 patients had somatic BRCA mutations and 12 patients had HR mutations.
The overall response rate (ORR) was 50% for BRCA-mutated (BRCAm) patients and 9.1% for non-BRCA HR-mutated (non-BRCA HRm) patients.
72.7% of patients with non-BRCA HR mutations had stable disease.
The duration of therapy ranged from 2 to 66 months.
The median TTP was 9.5 months.
Overall, 66.7% of patients in the entire cohort started on a reduced dose of PARP inhibitor.
Dose reductions due to AEs were observed in 52.4% of patients, while AEs requiring treatment interruption occurred in 61.9%.
We found that PARP inhibitors provided stable disease in a high proportion of recurrent ovarian cancer patients who had pathogenic HR mutations, with toxicities comparable to major trials.
Patients with non-BRCA HR and somatic BRCA mutations could benefit from PARP inhibitors.
