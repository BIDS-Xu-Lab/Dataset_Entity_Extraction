Pathophysiological changes in a critically ill patient, in particular the volume of distribution and clearance, may considerably influence the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of an antibiotic.
Data from studies have shown that the optimization of antibiotic dosing is equally important for both successful therapy and preventing the development of antibiotic resistance.
Optimal dosing requires a sufficient loading dose, a dosing regimen taking into account characteristics of antibiotic classes and patients such as obese ones or those receiving renal replacement therapy and monitoring of serum antibiotic concentrations.
