Inguinal hernia is a common birth defect in children, but there is limited information about the risk factors for this disorder.
The study aimed to explore the risk factors for the development of this disorder in children.
A frequency matching case-control study based on hospital group data was performed.
One hundred and thirty-two 0-6 years old children with inguinal hernia and 132 aged-matched controls were enrolled.
Children's general characteristics and their mothers' general characteristics before and during pregnancy were obtained by a questionnaire survey.
Risk factors for inguinal hernia were investigated by logistic regression analysis.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the development of inguinal hernia was related to children's cry and unease records (OR=3.70195%CI1.724-7.945), maternal consumption for pickles (OR=2.53495%CI: 1.279-5.021) and maternal anemia (OR=3.76195%CI1.497-9.450) one year before pregnancy and during the first 3 months of pregnancy, and the family history of inguinal hernia (OR=13.50595%CI5.825-31.307).
Children's cry and unease records, maternal anemia and pickle consumption one year before pregnancy and during the first 3 months of pregnancy, and family history of inguinal hernia are risk factors for the development of inguinal hernia in children.
