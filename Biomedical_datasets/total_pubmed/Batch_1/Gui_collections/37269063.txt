With the support of social exchange theory and social impact theory, this study aimed to examine the impact of transactional and transformational leadership on safety behaviour with the moderating role of cooperation facilitation in Chinese healthcare workers.
This study used a simple random sampling method and data were collected from healthcare workers in Zhenjiang city, Jiangsu province, China.
A total of 376 questionnaires were utilised and partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) technique was used for data analysis.
The result showed that transactional and transformational leadership positively impact safety behaviour of health care workers.
The findings also indicated that cooperation facilitation positively moderates the relationship between transactional and transformational leadership on safety behaviour.
