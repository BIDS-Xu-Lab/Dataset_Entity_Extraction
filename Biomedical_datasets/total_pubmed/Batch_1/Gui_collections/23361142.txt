The purpose of this study was to determine the opinions and expectations of patients and nurses about privacy during a hospital admission for surgery.
The study explored what enables and maintains privacy from the perspective of Turkish surgical patients and nurses.
The study included 102 adult patients having surgery and 47 nurses caring for them.
Data were collected via semistructured questionnaire by face-to-face interviews.
The results showed that patients were mostly satisfied by the respect shown to their privacy by the nurses but were less confident of the confidentiality of their personal data.
It was found that patients have expectations regarding nursing approaches and attitudes about acknowledging and respecting patient autonomy and confidentiality.
It is remarkable that while nurses focused on the physical dimension of privacy, patients focused on informational and psychosocial dimensions of privacy, as well as its physical dimension.
