Crown dimensions data of deciduous teeth hold anthropological, forensic, and archaeological value.
However, such information remains scarce for the Chinese population.
This multi-center study aimed to collect a large sample of deciduous crown data from Chinese children using three-dimensional measurement methods and to analyze their dimensions.
A total of 1592 children's deciduous dentition samples were included, and the sample size was distributed according to Northeast, North, East, Northwest, Southwest and South China.
Digital dental models were reconstructed from plaster dental models.
Independent sample t test, paired t test, principal component analysis (PCA), and factor analysis (FA) were used to analyze the tooth crown dimensions.
18,318 deciduous teeth from 1592 children were included.
Males exhibited slightly larger values than females.
The range of sexual dimorphism percentages for each measurement was as follows: mesiodistal diameter (0.40-2.08), buccolingual diameter (0.13-2.24), and maxillogingival diameter (0.48-3.37).
The FA results showed that the main trend of crown dimensions changes was the simultaneous increase or decrease in mesiodistal diameter, buccolingual diameter and maxillogingival diameter in three directions.
This is the first large-scale survey of deciduous tooth crown dimensions in China, which supplements the data of deciduous tooth measurement and provides a reference for clinical application.
