Craniofacial osteosarcomas (CFOS) are uncommon malignant neoplasms of the head and neck with different clinical presentation, biological behavior and prognosis from conventional osteosarcomas of long bones.
Very limited genetic data have been published on CFOS.
In the current study, we performed comprehensive genomic studies in 15 cases of high-grade CFOS by SNP array and targeted next generation sequencing.
Our study shows high-grade CFOS demonstrate highly complex and heterogenous genomic alterations and harbor frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes TP53, CDKN2A/B, and PTEN, similar to conventional osteosarcomas.
Potentially actionable gene amplifications involving CCNE1, AKT2, MET, NTRK1, PDGFRA, KDR, KIT, MAP3K14, FGFR1, and AURKA were seen in 43% of cases.
GNAS hotspot activating mutations were also identified in a subset of CFOS cases, with one case representing malignant transformation from fibrous dysplasia, suggesting a role for GNAS mutation in the development of CFOS.
High-grade CFOS demonstrate highly complex and heterogenous genomic alterations, with amplification involving receptor tyrosine kinase genes, and frequent mutations involving tumor suppressor genes.
