Anticonvulsant drugs are frequently given after craniotomy.
Phenytoin (PHT) is the most commonly used agent; levetiracetam (LEV) is a new anticonvulsant drug with fewer side effects.
To compare the incidence of seizures in patients receiving either prophylactic PHT or LEV perioperatively, 971 patients undergoing a craniotomy were analysed retrospectively during a 2-year period.
PHT was used routinely and LEV was administered when PHT was contraindicated.
Seizures documented during the first 7 days after craniotomy were considered.
A total of 235 patients were treated with an antiepileptic drug: 81 patients received LEV, and 154 patients, PHT.
Two patients receiving LEV (2.5%) and seven receiving PHT (4.5%) had a seizure despite this treatment.
No patient had a documented side effect or drug interaction.
The data show that LEV may be an alternative option in patients with contraindications to PHT.
