Chemical modifications have been extensively used for therapeutic oligonucleotides because they strongly enhance the stability against nucleases, binding affinity to the targets, and efficacy.
We previously reported that oligonucleotides modified with an N-methylguanidine-bridged nucleic acid (GuNA[Me]) bearing the thymine (T) nucleobase show excellent biophysical properties for applications in antisense technology.
In this paper, we describe the synthesis of GuNA[Me] phosphoramidites bearing other typical nucleobases including adenine (A), guanine (G), and 5-methylcytosine (mC).
The phosphoramidites were successfully incorporated into oligonucleotides following the method previously developed for the GuNA[Me]-T-modified oligonucleotides.
The binding affinity of the oligonucleotides modified with GuNA[Me]-A, -G, or -mC toward the complementary single-stranded DNAs or RNAs was systematically evaluated.
All of the GuNA[Me]-modified oligonucleotides were found to have a strong affinity for RNAs.
These data indicate that GuNA[Me] could be a useful modification for therapeutic antisense oligonucleotides.
