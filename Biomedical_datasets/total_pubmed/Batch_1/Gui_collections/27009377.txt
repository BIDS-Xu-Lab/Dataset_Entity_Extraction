The management of locally recurrent renal-cell carcinoma (RCC) following cryoablation remains a clinical dilemma.
There is limited data regarding the management of locally recurrent disease in the setting of patients who have failed initial percutaneous cryoablation (PCA).
We evaluate and report our experience with salvage PCA for local recurrence following renal cryoablation failure.
We reviewed our experience with patients who underwent salvage PCA for local biopsy proven RCC recurrence following primary cryoablation procedures.
Complications and oncologic outcomes were evaluated.
Recurrence-free survival after primary and repeat cryoablation was plotted using the Kaplan-Meier curves.
A total 250 patients underwent primary cryoablation for RCC and 20 (8%)
patients were identified who underwent repeat PCA for 21 locally recurrent tumors.
The mean tumor size was 2.4â€‰cm.
Biopsy revealed clear cell in 14 patients, three papillary and four chromophobe RCC.
All repeat cryoablation procedures were completed successfully, with no treatment failures on postprocedure imaging.
There were no complications or deaths.
With the median follow-up of 30 months (range 7-63), 3 (15%) patients experienced local recurrence.
One patient had an enhancing lesion at 13 months following repeat PCA and underwent a third PCA.
Two patients had recurrence at 6 and 35 months respectively and underwent successful laparoscopic partial nephrectomy.
Local recurrence-free, metastasis-free and cancer-specific survival rates were 85%, 100%, and 100% respectively.
Limitations include retrospective design and small number of patients.
Repeat PCA after primary cryoablation failure is feasible, has a low complication rate, and acceptable short-term oncologic outcomes.
Further studies with durable follow-up are required.
