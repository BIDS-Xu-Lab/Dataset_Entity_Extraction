Enhancement of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions to ovalbumin (OVA) was demonstrated in guinea pigs given a single, high dose of cyclosporin A (CsA) intraperitoneally, 2 days before immunization.
Courses of oral CsA, commencing at the time of immunization and lasting until day 4 or 13 also resulted in augmented DTH responses at days 14 and 28, respectively.
However, the enhancing protocol (CsA; day 0-4) did not significantly affect circulating anti-OVA antibody titres.
The capacity to express increased DTH could be adoptively transferred to naive recipients by systemic injection pooled spleen and peritoneal exudate cells.
Moreover, the expression of augmented responses was inhibited by transfer of cells from normally immunized donors.
Although augmentation of DTH was accompanied by increased lymphocyte proliferative responses to OVA in vitro, there was no similar effect on T cell responses to polyclonal mitogens.
The data support the view that augmentation of DTH by CsA is attributable to suppressor cell dysfunction, but that this is unlikely to be a non-specific suppressor cell impairment.
