This review summarizes and systematizes currently available literature on antipsychotics as one of the most frequently prescribed group of psychotropic drugs.
Based on published data from clinical studies and meta-analyzes, the authors consider unwanted adverse reactions in patients taking antipsychotic medications.
Mechanisms of development of undesirable drug reactions are discussed.
Special attention is paid to those adverse reactions of antipsychotics that most often occur in old and very old age (increased risk of adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, sudden death, prolonged QTc interval, falls, fractures, orthostatic hypotension, extrapyramidal disorders, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, etc.).
