The rates of relapses and therapy discontinuation in patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) in the modern therapeutic era have not been defined.
We aimed to evaluate the glucocorticoid (GC) discontinuation rate and the factors associated with relapses in a contemporary GCA cohort.
Patient and treatment data were collected cross-sectionally at first evaluation and 2 years later (second evaluation), in a multicenter, prospective GCA cohort.
Predictors of relapses were identified by logistic regression analyses.
243 patients with GCA were initially included (67% women, mean age at diagnosis: 72.1 years, median disease duration: 2 years) while 2 years later complete data for 160 patients were available and analyzed.
All patients had received GCs at diagnosis (mean daily prednisolone dose: 40 mg) while during follow-up, 37% received non-biologic and 16% biologic agents, respectively.
At second evaluation, 72% of patients were still on therapy (GCs: 58% and/or GC-sparing agents: 29%).
Relapses occurred in 27% of patients during follow-up; by multivariable logistic regression analysis, large vessel involvement at diagnosis [odds ratio (OR) = 4.22], a cardiovascular event during follow-up (OR = 4.60) and a higher initial GC daily dose (OR = 1.04), were associated with these relapses.
In this large, real-life, contemporary GCA cohort, the rates of GC discontinuation and relapses were 40% and 27%, respectively.
Large vessel involvement, a higher GC dose at diagnosis and new cardiovascular events during follow-up were associated with relapses.
