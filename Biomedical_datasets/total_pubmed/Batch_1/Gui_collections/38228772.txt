In previous studies, replicated and multiple types of speech data have been used for Parkinson's disease (PD) detection.
However, two main problems in these studies are lower PD detection accuracy and inappropriate validation methodologies leading to unreliable results.
This study discusses the effects of inappropriate validation methodologies used in previous studies and highlights the use of appropriate alternative validation methods that would ensure generalization.
To enhance PD detection accuracy, we propose a two-stage diagnostic system that refines the extracted set of features through [Formula: see text] regularized linear support vector machine and classifies the refined subset of features through a deep neural network.
To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed diagnostic system, experiments are performed on two different voice recording-based benchmark datasets.
For both datasets, the proposed diagnostic system achieves 100% accuracy under leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation (CV) and 97.5% accuracy under k-fold CV.
The results show that the proposed system outperforms the existing methods regarding PD detection accuracy.
The results suggest that the proposed diagnostic system is essential to improving non-invasive diagnostic decision support in PD.
