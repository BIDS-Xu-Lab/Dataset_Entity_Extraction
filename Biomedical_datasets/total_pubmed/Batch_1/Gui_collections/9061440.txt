To improve employee attendance at Annual Review Day, the day when all mandatory hospitalwide education requirements are presented.
The Finley Hospital (Dubuque, Iowa) initiated a performance improvement team in March 1993.
Data collected previous to 1993 indicated that the compliance goal of 90% was being met only with difficulty.
Data indicated three main areas where improvements could be made-communication, enforcement, and curriculum.
Recommendations of task forces, with team members as leaders, were implemented.
Decisions were made to change Annual Review Day to a full-day format to include all mandatory education, make outcomes competency based, and maintain cost-effectiveness.
The one-year trial run began in 1994 with gradual changes in the program from a lecture and video format to an interactive game format.
For example, at one point a crossword puzzle with information on infection control and bloodborne pathogens was added.
The Jeopardy Game format, used to teach the principles of emergency preparedness, was added in June 1994.
Full implementation of the curriculum, communication, and enforcement recommendations have resulted in 100% compliance.
The performance improvement team has continued to monitor results and submit quarterly reports to the quality management department.
All participants must complete and pass a competency-based test on the information covered; all 760 participants have passed.
The curriculum task force continues to meet on a yearly basis to evaluate the ever-evolving format, analyze attendee evaluations, and consider annual changes to the format.
