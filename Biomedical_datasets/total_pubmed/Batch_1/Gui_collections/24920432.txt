Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants were generated by introduction of the human P450 CYP1A2 gene, which metabolizes a number of herbicides, insecticides and industrial chemicals.
Transgenic A. thaliana plants expressing CYP1A2 gene showed remarkable resistance to the phenylurea herbicide chlortoluron (CTU) supplemented either in plant growth medium or sprayed on foliar parts of the plants.
HPLC analyses showed a strong reduction in CTU accumulation in planta supporting the tolerance of transgenic lines to high concentrations of CTU.
Besides increased herbicide tolerance, expression of CYP1A2 resulted in no other visible phenotype in transgenic plants.
Our data indicate that CYP1A2 can be used as a selectable marker for plant transformation, allowing efficient selection of transgenic lines in growth medium and/or in soil-grown plants.
Moreover, these transgenic plants appear to be useful for herbicide resistance as well as phytoremediation of environmental contaminants.
