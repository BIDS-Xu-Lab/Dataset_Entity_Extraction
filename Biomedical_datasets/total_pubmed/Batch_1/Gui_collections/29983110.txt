This study examined national patterns, predictors, and trends in depression screening among adults without a diagnosis of depression in the United States.
A cross-sectional design utilizing pooled data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (2005-2015) was used.
The study sample consisted of ambulatory care visits to nonpsychiatrists among adults (â‰¥18 years) without a depression diagnosis.
Depression screening was the dependent variable.
Descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and piecewise regression analyses were conducted to achieve the study objectives.
The national-level depression screening rate was 1.4% of all adult ambulatory care visits.
Year, gender, physician specialty, geographic region, and time spent with physician were significantly associated with depression screening.
Piecewise regression analysis revealed a statistically significant (p<.001) interaction between year and change in depression screening rate, where screening rates increased significantly after 2009.
Although screening rates have increased significantly after 2009, screening remains low among adults without a depression diagnosis.
