There has been a growing interest in developing cuff-less blood pressure (BP) estimation methods to enable continuous BP monitoring from electrocardiogram (ECG) and/or photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals.
The majority of these methods have been evaluated using publicly-available datasets, however, there exist significant discrepancies across studies with respect to the size, the number of subjects, and the applied pre-processing steps for the data that is eventually used for training and testing the models.
Such differences make conducting performance comparison across models largely unfair, and mask the generalization capability of various BP estimation methods.
To fill this important gap, this paper presents "PulseDB," the largest cleaned dataset to date, for benchmarking BP estimation models that also fulfills the requirements of standardized testing protocols.
PulseDB contains 1) 5,245,454 high-quality 10 -s segments of ECG, PPG, and arterial BP (ABP) waveforms from 5,361 subjects retrieved from the MIMIC-III waveform database matched subset and the VitalDB database; 2) subjects' identification and demographic information, that can be utilized as additional input features to improve the performance of BP estimation models, or to evaluate the generalizability of the models to data from unseen subjects; and 3) positions of the characteristic points of the ECG/PPG signals, making PulseDB directly usable for training deep learning models with minimal data pre-processing.
Additionally, using this dataset, we conduct the first study to provide insights about the performance gap between calibration-based and calibration-free testing approaches for evaluating generalizability of the BP estimation models.
We expect PulseDB, as a user-friendly, large, comprehensive and multi-functional dataset, to be used as a reliable source for the evaluation of cuff-less BP estimation methods.
