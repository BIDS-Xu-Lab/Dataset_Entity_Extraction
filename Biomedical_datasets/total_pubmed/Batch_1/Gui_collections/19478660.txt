We performed a retrospective study of spinal roentgenograms of a large cohort of patients suffering from osteogenesis imperfecta.
To determine the prevalence of vertebral pars defects (spondylolysis) in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta.
Patients suffering from osteogenesis imperfecta are known to be prone to pathologic fractures.
Pathologic fractures due to microtraumas, repetitive activities, and posture acting together on a congenitally weakened pars interarticularis may lead to vertebral pars defects.
The prevalence of vertebral pars defects in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta has never been studied before to our knowledge.
We performed a retrospective study of posterior-anterior and lateral, standing, roentgenograms of the spine of patients with osteogenesis imperfecta for the occurrence of vertebral pars interarticularis defects.
The patients (5.3%) in our series showed vertebral pars defects, this is not significantly different from the prevalence of vertebral pars defects in the general population.
5.3% of the patients with osteogenesis imperfecta showed vertebral pars defects, this does not differ significantly from the occurrence in the general population.
