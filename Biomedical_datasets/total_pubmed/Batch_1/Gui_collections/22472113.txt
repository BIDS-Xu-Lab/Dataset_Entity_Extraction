Galphimia glauca has a long traditional use, and continues to be used in Mexico as a natural tranquilizer for the treatment of Central Nervous System disorders as well as for other illnesses.
In 2005 the initial use of metabolic profiling to populations of Galphimia glauca resulted in two of the six collected populations being producers for galphimines, the markers for sedative and anxiolytic activities.
The aim of this investigation was to confirm the previously established metabolic profile, as well as the previous in vivo results on mice.
Additionally in this study we wanted to investigate potential anti-inflammatory properties.
Four years later, we collected samples in the five localities designated for the first-stage investigation in 2005, and in two new locations.
Metabolic profiling was carried out by means of (1)H NMR spectroscopy and multivariate data analysis applied to crude extracts from wild plant specimens.
HPLC analysis was performed to confirm and quantify the presence of galphimines.
Two neuropharmacological in vivo assays on mice were employed to study anxiolytic (elevated plus maze test) and sedative (sodium pentobarbital-induced hypnosis model) activities in the extracts.
Anti-inflammatory activity was determined by using the tetradecanoylphorbol acetate-induced mouse ear inflammation model (TPA).
The results for the 2009 collected species were similar to the 2005 collection, confirming the metabolic profiles and that galphimines are consistent good markers for CNS activity.
Galloylquinic acid levels varied between the years without, as of yet, known effects.
In vivo anti-inflammatory activity was similar for all plants and thus not linked with galphimines, requiring further studies to identify the active compound(s).
Areas of collection affect neuropharmacological activities but not anti-inflammatory action.
