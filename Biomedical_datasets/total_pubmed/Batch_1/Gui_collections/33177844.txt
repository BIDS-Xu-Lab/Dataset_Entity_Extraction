Antimicrobial resistance is a worldwide concern due to the inappropriate and irrational use of antibiotics.
Thus, this study was aimed at determining the knowledge and attitude of graduating health science students of Wollega University towards antimicrobial resistance.
An institution-based cross-sectional study design was employed from June to July 2019.
Epi-data version 3.1 was used to receive data and exported to SPSS version 25 for further analysis.
Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were done to find factors associated with attitudes of students towards antibiotic consumption and resistance at a 95% confidence level.
The strength of association was measured with the odds ratio.
Variables with a p-value of <0.05 at multivariable analysis were considered to be a significant variable.
Finally, texts and simple frequency tables were used to present the findings.
Out of 249, 232 students were included in this survey yielding a response rate of 93.6%.
Hundred fifty-eight (68.1%) of them had adequate knowledge about antibiotic identification, role, side effects, and resistance.
Students with a family member who works in health and related professions had a lower probability of stopping antibiotics when they feel better (AOR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.28-0.90) and using leftover antibiotics (AOR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.28-0.92) compared to their counterparts.
Students' knowledge on antibiotic identification, role, side effects, and resistance was suboptimal, and the attitude of students towards antibiotic consumption was unfavorable.
Respondents having a family member in a health-related field showed a good attitude.
Respondents with three years of study also had a good attitude, female gender showed good attitude, and urban residence were independent predictors of attitude toward antibiotic consumption.
Training on antimicrobial resistance should be arranged for graduating class nursing and medical students, as they are the future prescribers.
