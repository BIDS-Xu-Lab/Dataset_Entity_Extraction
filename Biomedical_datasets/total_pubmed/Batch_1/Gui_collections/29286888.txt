To date, research applying the Sexual Relationship Power Scale (SRPS) has been limited to sexual risk behaviors.
We measured levels of sexual relationship power and examined associations between sexual relationship power and injecting and sexual behaviors that place women at increased risk for blood borne infections.
[DMD]) and injecting and sexual behaviors.
Of the 68 young WWID, 24 (34%) reported receptive syringe sharing, 38 (56%) reused/shared a cooker to prepare drugs, and 25 (37%) injected someone else's drug residue during the three-months prior to enrollment.
Most (60, 88%) reported condomless sex with main sex-partner, 8 (12%) reported transactional sex, and 36 (53%) had two or more recent sex partners.
The median SRPS score was 2.98 (IQR: 2.65, 3.18), 3.23 (IQR: 3.23, 3.57) for RC and 2.40 (IQR: 2.20, 2.60) for DMD.
No significant associations were detected between SRPS or DMD and injecting or sexual risk behaviors.
After adjusting for gender and years injecting, for every one-point increase in RC, women had a 6.70 lower odds of recent condomless sex (95%CI: 0.92, 50.00, p = 0.06), and a 3.90 lower odds of recent transactional sex (95%CI: 1.22, 12.50, p = 0.02).
Our study findings suggest that some components of sexual relationship power may play a role in sexual risk, but not in injecting risk.
