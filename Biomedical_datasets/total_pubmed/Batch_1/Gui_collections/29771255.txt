Omadacycline is a novel aminomethylcycline antimicrobial agent that is available in both oral and intravenous formulations.
The distinguishing structural characteristics of omadacycline from other tetracyclines allow for its continued antimicrobial activity in the presence of traditional tetracycline resistance mechanisms (efflux pumps and ribosomal protection proteins).
Omadacycline has been found to have potent activity against antibiotic-resistant pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Currently available data indicate that omadacycline is generally well tolerated with the most common adverse effects being gastrointestinal symptoms.
Omadacycline seems to be a promising new agent for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.
Studies for the treatment of cystitis in adult females are currently underway, and future results of these studies will further help delineate the antibacterial role of omadacycline.
