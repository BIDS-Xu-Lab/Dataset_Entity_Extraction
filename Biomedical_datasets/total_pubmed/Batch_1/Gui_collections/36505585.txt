According to statistics, the number of rhinoplasty applicants is increasing.
Rhinoplasty is performed to improve the nose shape fit into the face.
The main objective of this study was to determine the effect of rhinoplasty on changing body images in rhinoplasty candidates.
The statistical population of the present prospective study, including those referring to the Otorhinolaryngology Clinic of Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences (Iran) with complaints of dissatisfaction with the appearance of the nose and demand for rhinoplasty, completed Body Image Concern (BIC) Inventory and Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) before and 6 months after surgery at the clinic.
Data were analysed using SPSS software version 16 using Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon tests at a significance level of 0.05.
In total, 95 subjects were examined, of which 85 (89.5%) were women and 57 (60%) were single.
There was no difference in the mean scores of BIC and Y-BOCS between women and men as well as between single and married subjects (p < 0.05).
The Wilcoxon test results showed that the mean score of post-operative Y-BOCS was significantly increased in the rhinoplasty subjects (p < 0.001).
Moreover, the mean score of post-operative BIC was significantly decreased in the rhinoplasty subjects (p < 0.001).
The results of this study demonstrated that the rhinoplasty could improve the body image status and increase the obsessive thoughts and actions in an individual.
Therefore, psychological primary care for avoiding pointless surgical plan and pre-operative psychological counselling, is suggested to examine the individual's psychological status and to assess the individual's expectations of surgery along with the necessary explanations.
