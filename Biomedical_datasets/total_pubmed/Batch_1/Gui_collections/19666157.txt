Rock climbing is an increasingly popular sport in the U.S., with approximately nine million participants annually.
The sport holds an inherent risk of falls and stress-related injuries.
As indoor climbing facilities become more common, more people are participating in the sport.
The objective of this study is to describe the prevalence, characteristics, and trends of rock climbing-related injuries treated in U.S. emergency departments from 1990 through 2007.
A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission for all ages from 1990 through 2007.
Sample weights provided by NEISS were used to calculate national estimates of rock climbing-related injuries.
Trend significance of the number of rock climbing-related injuries over time was analyzed using linear regression.
An estimated 40,282 patients were treated in emergency departments for rock climbing-related injuries in the U.S. over the 18-year period.
Patients aged 20-39 years accounted for more than half of all injuries.
Fractures, sprains, and strains accounted for the largest portion of injuries (29.0% and 28.6%, respectively).
The lower extremities were the most frequently injured body part, accounting for 46.3% of all injuries; ankle injuries accounted for 19.2%.
Men were more likely to sustain lacerations (OR=1.65; 95% CI=1.03, 2.67) and fractures (OR=1.54; 95% CI=1.10, 2.17), whereas women were more likely to sustain a sprain or strain (OR=1.68; 95% CI=1.13, 2.51).
Overexertion injuries were more likely to occur to the upper extremities (OR=5.32; 95% CI=1.99, 14.23).
Falls were responsible for three quarters of all injuries (77.5%).
Overall, 11.3% of patients were hospitalized.
Our results indicate that the most common rock climbing-related injuries are to the lower extremities and are fractures, sprains, and strains.
More research is needed to determine how rock-climbers' characteristics, climbing setting, style of climbing, and use of safety equipment and training may affect their risk for certain injury patterns.
