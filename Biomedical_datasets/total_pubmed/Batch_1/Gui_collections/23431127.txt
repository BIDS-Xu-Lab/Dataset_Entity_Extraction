Because of imposed rapid social change, Alaska Native youth are growing up in a context different from their elders and suffering far worse health and behavioral outcomes.
This research seeks to understand (a) their everyday struggles and life challenges, (b) the practices and resources they rely on to get through challenges, and (c) the meaning they make from these experiences.
Data were generated from interviews with 20 Alaska Native youth between the ages of 11 and 18 years, balanced by gender and age-group (early and late adolescence).
Purposive sampling identified participants with a broad range of experiences.
Following a semistructured guide, youth participated in face-to-face, audio-recorded interviews, transcribed verbatim.
A codebook was developed using an iterative process and transcripts were coded using ATLAS.ti.
The most commonly identified stressors were relationship loss, "not being there for me," nonsupportive/hostile experiences, transitioning into adulthood, and boredom.
Resilience strategies included developing and maintaining relationships with others, being responsible, creating systems of reciprocity, practicing subsistence living, and giving back to family and the community.
These opportunities allowed youth to gain a sense of competence and mastery.
When difficult experiences align with opportunities for being responsible and competent, youth are most likely to exhibit resilience.
