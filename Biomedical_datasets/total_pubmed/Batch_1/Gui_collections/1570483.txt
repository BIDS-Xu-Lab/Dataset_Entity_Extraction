The fasciitis-panniculitis syndrome is histologically characterized by fibrous thickening and inflammation of the subcutaneous septa, fascia and perimysium.
These morphological features were the common denominator in 13 patients with Shulman's eosinophilic fasciitis, scleroderma profunda, venous lipodermatosclerosis, induration following recurrent erysipelas and erysipeloid erythema nodosum.
Small to medium-sized vessel phlebitis was found in the subcutaneous and perimysial tissues of 11 of the patients and subcutaneous phlebosclerosis was encountered in all cases.
These data contrast with the low incidence of phlebopathy reported by others in these disorders.
