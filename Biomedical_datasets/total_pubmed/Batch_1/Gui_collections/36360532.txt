To investigate the trends in hospital admissions for mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders (MBNDs) in England and Wales.
This is an ecological study using the Hospital Episode Statistics database in England and the Patient Episode Database for Wales.
Hospital admission data was collected for the period between April 1999 and March 2019.
The most common type of hospital admission was for mental and behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substance use, which accounted for 26.6%.
The admission rate among males increased by 8.1% [from 479.59 (95% CI 476.90-482.27) in 1999 to 518.30 (95% CI 515.71-520.90) in 2019 per 1000 persons; p &lt; 0.001].
The admission rate among females increased by 0.3% [from 451.45 (95% CI 448.91-453.99) in 1999 to 452.77 (95% CI 450.37-455.17) in 2019 per 1000 persons; p = 0.547].
The 15-59 years' age group accounted for 65.1% of the entire number of such hospital admissions, followed by the 75 years and above age group, with 19.0%.
Conclusion: We observed an obvious variation in MBNDs influenced by age and gender.
Observational studies are needed to identify other factors associated with increased hospital admission rates related to MBNDs, specifically among the young population (aged 15-59 years) and males.
