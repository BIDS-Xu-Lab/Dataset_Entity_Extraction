Unsupervised abnormality detection is an appealing approach to identify patterns that are not present in training data without specific annotations for such patterns.
In the medical imaging field, methods taking this approach have been proposed to detect lesions.
The appeal of this approach stems from the fact that it does not require lesion-specific supervision and can potentially generalize to any sort of abnormal patterns.
The principle is to train a generative model on images from healthy individuals to estimate the distribution of images of the normal anatomy, i.e., a normative distribution, and detect lesions as out-of-distribution regions.
Restoration-based techniques that modify a given image by taking gradient ascent steps with respect to a posterior distribution composed of a normative distribution and a likelihood term recently yielded state-of-the-art results.
However, these methods do not explicitly model ascent directions with respect to the normative distribution, i.e. normative ascent direction, which is essential for successful restoration.
In this work, we introduce a novel approach for unsupervised lesion detection by modeling normative ascent directions.
We present different modelling options based on the defined ascent directions with local Gaussians.
We further extend the proposed method to efficiently utilize 3D information, which has not been explored in most existing works.
We experimentally show that the proposed method provides higher accuracy in detection and produces more realistic restored images.
The performance of the proposed method is evaluated against baselines on publicly available BRATS and ATLAS stroke lesion datasets; the detection accuracy of the proposed method surpasses the current state-of-the-art results.
