The aim of the present study was to investigate the application of 3D printing (3DP) rapid prototyping (RP) technique-assisted percutaneous fixation in the treatment of femoral intertrochanteric fracture (ITF) using proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA).
A total of 39 patients with unstable ITF were included in the current study.
Patients were divided into two groups: 19 patients were examined using computed tomography scanning and underwent PFNA with SDP-RP whereas the other 20 patients underwent conventional PFNA treatment.
Anatomical data were converted from the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine format to the stereolithography format using M3D software.
The 3DP-RP model was established using the fused deposition modeling technique and the length and diameter of the main screw blade was measured during the simulation.
The postoperative femoral neck-shaft angle (NSA), surgery duration, intraoperative and postoperative blood loss, and the duration of hospital stay were recorded and compared with the corresponding values in conventional surgery.
No significant differences were observed in mean PFNA size between the implants used and the preoperative planning estimates.
It was demonstrated that the 3DP-RP assisted procedure resulted in more effective reduction of the NSA.
Furthermore, patients undergoing 3DP-RP experienced a significant reduction in duration of surgery (P<0.01), as well as reductions in intraoperative (P=0.02) and postoperative (P=0.03) blood loss, compared with conventional surgery.
At 6 months post-surgery, no cases of hip varus/vague deformities or implant failure were observed in patients that underwent either the 3DP-RP-assisted or conventional procedure.
The results of the present study suggest that the 3DP-RP technique is able to create an accurate model of the ITF, which facilitates surgical planning and fracture reduction, thus improving the efficiency of PFNA surgery for ITFs.
