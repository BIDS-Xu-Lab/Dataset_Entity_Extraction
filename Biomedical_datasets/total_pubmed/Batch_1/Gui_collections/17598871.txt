For many years, and especially since Waynbaum and Wallon, psychology and psychopathology have dealt with cognitive perception, but have had little to do with the affective qualities of perception.
Our aim was to study the influence of the sensory environment on people with autism.
Several experiments were carried out using different forms of tactile stimulation (passive and active subjects).
Our data showed specific responses in children with autism and intellectual disability.
These children displayed a strong (positive) valence to the stimulation provided.
They were very attracted to the stimulation and were excited by it.
