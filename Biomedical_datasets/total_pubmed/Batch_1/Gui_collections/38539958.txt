Insectivorous bats play a crucial role in agroecosystems by providing invaluable pest control services.
With the escalating impacts of climate change, a comprehensive understanding of the environmental factors influencing bat activity becomes imperative for their conservation in agricultural landscapes.
This study investigates the influence of weather conditions, specifically air temperature and relative humidity, on the timing activity and the relative abundance of five insectivorous bat species in central Chile.
Data from automatic bat detectors and climatological stations are utilized for analysis.
Our results unveil species-specific behaviors, with Tadarida brasiliensis exhibiting early emergence and extended activity periods compared to other bat species.
Histiotus montanus and Lasiurus villosissimus display delayed onsets on more humid evenings, whereas Lasiurus varius and T. brasiliensis initiate activity earlier on colder nights compared to warmer ones.
Relative humidity emerges as a key factor influencing relative abundance for all species, with more minutes with bat passes detected on drier nights.
These findings suggest that global warming may influence observed bat behaviors, potentially altering foraging patterns and activity levels of these bat species.
Moreover, as climate change continues, understanding the long-term impact on bat populations and their adaptive strategies is crucial for effective conservation measures.
Further studies exploring these dynamics can provide valuable insights for shaping conservation efforts in the face of evolving environmental challenges.
