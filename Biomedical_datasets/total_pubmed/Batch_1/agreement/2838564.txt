The concentrations of apo (unoccupied), holo (occupied), and total cellular retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP) were measured at various stages of axolotl limb regeneration.
The ratio of apo-CRABP to holo-CRABP declined with advancing regenerate stage until the CRABP was all in the holo form.
The increase in holo-CRABP is correlated with a stage-dependent shift in the effect of exogenous retinoic acid on regenerate pattern, from pattern duplication to inhibition of regeneration.
The data suggest, though they do not prove, that these different morphological effects could be due to a shift from a CRABP-dependent to a CRABP-independent mechanism of exogenous retinoic acid (RA) action that is related to stage-specific variations in endogenous RA levels.
