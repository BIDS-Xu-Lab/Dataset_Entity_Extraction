Angioectasias represents the most frequently found lesion in the small bowel by device-assisted enteroscopy for obscure gastrointestinal bleeding in Western countries.
Recurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding after angioectasias therapy remains unclear and data regarding the efficacy of additional endoscopic therapeutic sessions to reduce the rebleeding rate is limited.
To evaluate the rebleeding rate in small bowel angioectasias after a second endoscopic treatment with balloon-assisted enteroscopy after an initial bleed during the first endoscopic treatment.
A retrospective double-center study of patients with small-bowel angioectasias undergoing a second enteroscopy treatment due to a first rebleeding episode.
The endpoint was rebleeding, defined as the need for a blood transfusion, the presence of overt bleeding or a decrease in hemoglobin â‰¥ 2 g/dL.
Fifteen of 37 (40.5%) patients with small-bowel angioectasias that underwent a second endoscopic therapy after a first rebleeding episode (n = 15) experienced a second rebleeding episode.
Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that most rebleeding episodes occurred within the first 12 months of follow-up, resulting in a rebleeding rate of 33.1% at 6 months, 39.1% at 12 months and 52.6% at 24 months.
Despite the high absolute short-term rebleeding rate, further endoscopic treatments may be beneficial due to the effective reduction of rebleeding in a subset of patients.
