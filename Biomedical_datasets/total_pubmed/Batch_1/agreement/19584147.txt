The study aims to evaluate if human keratinocyte growth factor (hKGF), secreted after transduction of murine salivary glands with adenoviral vectors, can prevent oral mucositis resulting from radiation.
Two serotype 5 adenoviral vectors encoding hKGF were constructed: AdEF1alpha-hKGF and AdLTR(2)EF1alpha-hKGF.
Female C3H mice, 8 weeks old, were irradiated by single (22.5 Gy) or fractionated (5 x 8 Gy for 5 days) doses to induce oral mucositis (ulcers on tongue).
One day before irradiation, the above viral vectors or an empty vector, Adcontrol, was given (10(10) particles per gland) to both submandibular glands by retrograde ductal instillation.
Each experiment included five groups: no irradiation and irradiation (+/-Adcontrol, AdEF1alpha-hKGF, or AdLTR(2)EF1alpha-hKGF).
Blood, saliva, submandibular glands, and tongue were collected on day 7 for single-dose studies or day 10 for fractionated dosing.
hKGF levels were measured by ELISA.
In three separate single-dose irradiation experiments, lingual ulcers were dramatically reduced after either KGF-expressing vector.
Similarly, in two separate fractionated irradiation experiments, the hKGF-expressing vectors completely prevented ulcer formation.
QPCR data indicated that approximately 10(7) to 10(8) particles of each vector remained in the targeted submandibular glands at the terminal time.
Transgenic hKGF protein was found at high levels in saliva, serum, and submandibular gland extracts.
hKGF gene transfer to salivary glands prevented radiation-induced oral mucositis in mice.
This proof of concept study suggests that transgenic hKGF secreted from transduced salivary glands may be useful clinically to prevent oral mucositis caused by radiation.
