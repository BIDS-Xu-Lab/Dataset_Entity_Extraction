The safety profile of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors has continued to evolve with the availability of data from clinical trial programs, post-marketing pharmacovigilance and dedicated cardiovascular outcome trials.
This article reviews the safety issues associated with the SGLT2 inhibitors canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin, particularly the newer/emergent safety data related to US Food and Drug Administration statements regarding these three agents.
The safety profile of SGLT2 inhibitors is well defined, and the adverse event profile is largely consistent with their mechanism of action.
These well-recognized events include genital mycotic infections and volume-associated adverse events.
Serious safety issues detected more recently with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, such as bone fractures, pyelonephritis, urosepsis, and ketoacidosis, have been uncommon.
A robust improvement in cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was recently demonstrated with empagliflozin.
Given the glucose-lowering efficacy, low risk of hypoglycemia, and other benefits associated with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, this class of oral glucose-lowering medication is a valuable addition to treatment options for T2DM, and may play an increasingly prominent therapeutic role as emerging data are revealed.
