Delayed loading is one of the concerns in implant patients.
Immediate loading can solve the problem and make patients more satisfied.
The present study aimed to compare the removal torque of maxi implants under different loading (immediate and delayed) patterns.
This split-mouth experimental study included 2 dogs.
Impressions were made and then all the premolars were extracted under general anesthesia.
After a three-month healing period, 3 implants were inserted in each quadrant (a total of 12 implants).
Anterior and posterior implants (the case group) were splinted by an acrylic temporary bridge in order to make the middle implants (the control group) off the occlusion.
The dogs were sacrificed after 6 weeks and bone blocks were submitted for removal torque test.
Data were analyzed with ANOVA (P<0.05).
Mean torque values for the cases and control groups were 46.82±25.58 and 59.88±15.19, respectively (P=0.582; not significant).
It may be concluded that immediate loading does not reduce the reverse torque values of maxi implants.
This supports the advantages of immediate loading for maxi implants.
