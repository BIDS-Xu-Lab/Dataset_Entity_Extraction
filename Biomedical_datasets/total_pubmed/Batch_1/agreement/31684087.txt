To support the development of miniaturized photoacoustic gas sensors, a fully coupled finite element model for a frequency response simulation of cantilever-based photoacoustic gas sensors is introduced in this paper.
The model covers the whole photoacoustic process from radiation absorption to pressure transducer vibration, and considers viscous damping loss.
After validation with experimental data, the model was further applied to evaluate the possibility of further optimization and miniaturization of a previously reported sensor design.
