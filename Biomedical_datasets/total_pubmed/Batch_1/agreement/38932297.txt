Understanding how attitudes and beliefs about COVID-19 vaccination have changed over time is essential for identifying areas where targeted messaging and interventions can improve vaccination confidence and uptake.
Using data from multiple waves of the nationally representative U.S. Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey collected from January 2021 to May 2023, we assessed reasons for the non-vaccination of adults, adolescents, and children using the Health Belief Model as the framework for understanding behavior.
Among unvaccinated adults, perceived vulnerability increased from 11.9% to 44.1%, attitudinal factors/mistrust increased from 28.6% to 53.4%, and lack of cue to action increased from 7.5% to 9.7% from January 2021 to May 2022.
On the other hand, safety/efficacy concerns decreased from 74.0% to 60.9%, and logistical barriers to vaccination decreased from 9.1% to 3.4% during the same time period.
Regarding reasons for non-vaccination of youth, perceived vulnerability increased from 32.8% to 40.0%, safety/efficacy concerns decreased from 73.9% to 60.4%, and lack of cue to action increased from 10.4% to 13.4% between September 2021 and May 2023.
While safety/efficacy concerns and logistic barriers have decreased, increases in perceived vulnerability to COVID-19, mistrust, and lack of cues to action suggest that more efforts are needed to address these barriers to vaccination.
