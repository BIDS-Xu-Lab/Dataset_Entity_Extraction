The article presents the data of the study of different models of aerobic and anaerobic exercise in 208 elderly people (89 men and 119 women), which were divided into three groups.
The 1st group (control) received standard recommendations of the doctor on the regime of physical activity (daily walks of at least 30 minutes).
The 2nd group in addition to the standard recommendations received training in the form of Nordic walking with the regime of classes twice per week for 60 minutes.
The 3rd group in addition to the standard recommendations received combined aerobic exercise in the form of Nordic walking twice per week for 60 minutes + anaerobic exercises with a frequency of training twice per week for 30 minutes.
It was found that the best results of the increase in total activity, improved gait and stability, as well as increased muscle strength were achieved in the 3rd group of patients.
Such, combined aerobic-anaerobic exercise can be recommended as a program of geriatric prevention of disorders associated with the risk of dynapenia and sarcopenia.
