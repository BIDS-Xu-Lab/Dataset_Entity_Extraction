A compelling hypothesis about attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) etiopathogenesis is that the ADHD phenotype reflects a delay in cortical maturation.
Slow-wave activity (SWA) of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) is an electrophysiological index of sleep intensity reflecting cortical maturation.
Available data on ADHD and SWA are conflicting, and developmental differences, or the effect of pharmacological treatment, are relatively unknown.
