Cervical cancer (CC) is one of the most common cancers among females worldwide.
Spindle and kinetochore-associated complex subunit 3 (SKA3), located on chromosome 13q, was identified as a novel gene involved in promoting malignant transformation in cancers.
However, the function and underlying mechanisms of SKA3 in CC remain unknown.
Using the Oncomine database, we found that expression of SKA3 mRNA is higher in CC tissues than in normal tissues and is linked with poor prognosis.
In our study, immunohistochemistry showed increased expression of SKA3 in CC tissues.
The effect of SKA3 on cell proliferation and migration was evaluated by CCK8, clone formation, Transwell and wound-healing assays in HeLa and SiHa cells with stable SKA3 overexpression and knockdown.
In addition, we established a xenograft tumor model in vivo.
SKA3 overexpression promoted cell proliferation and migration and accelerated tumor growth.
We further identified that SKA3 is involved in regulating cell cycle progression and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway via RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) and gene set enrichment analyses.
Western blotting results revealed that SKA3 overexpression increased levels of p-Akt, cyclin E2, CDK2, cyclin D1, CDK4, E2F1 and p-Rb in HeLa cells.
Additionally, the use of an Akt inhibitor (GSK690693) significantly reversed the cell proliferation capacity induced by SKA3 overexpression in HeLa cells.
We suggest that SKA3 overexpression contributes to CC cell growth and migration by promoting cell cycle progression and activating the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which may provide potential novel therapeutic targets for CC treatment.
