TI  - Cortical ripples mediate top-down suppression of hippocampal reactivation during 
      sleep memory consolidation.

AB  - Consolidation of initially encoded hippocampal representations in the neocortex 
      through reactivation is crucial for long-term memory formation, and is 
      facilitated by the coordination of hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) with 
      cortical oscillations during non-REM sleep. However, the contribution of 
      high-frequency cortical ripples to consolidation is still unclear. We used 
      continuous recordings in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) over the 
      course of spatial learning and show that independent PFC ripples, when 
      dissociated from SWRs, predominantly suppress hippocampal activity in non-REM 
      sleep. PFC ripples paradoxically mediate top-down suppression of hippocampal 
      reactivation, which is inversely related to reactivation strength during 
      coordinated CA1-PFC ripples. Further, we show non-canonical, serial coordination 
      of ripples with cortical slow and spindle oscillations. These results establish a 
      role for cortical ripples in regulating consolidation.

TI  - Reversal of arterial oxygen desaturation with the use of an oxygen concentrator 
      during injectable anaesthesia in feral cats positioned in the Trendelenburg, 
      dorsal or lateral surgical position.

AB  - This study observed the effects of oxygen supplementation, via an oxygen 
      concentrator, on peripheral arterial blood oxygenation (SpO2) measured by pulse 
      oximetry in anaesthetised cats undergoing spay in three different surgical 
      positions. A total of 192 female feral cats were investigated for a large-scale 
      trap-neuter-release program. Cats were anaesthetised with an intramuscular 
      combination of butorphanol (0,4 mg / kg), ketamine (7-10 mg / kg) and 
      medetomidine (0,03-0,05 mg / kg). Cats were randomly allocated to undergo spay in 
      either Trendelenburg (TR) (70 degrees  downward head tilt), lateral (LR) or dorsal (DR) 
      recumbency. Cats were breathing spontaneously either room air or 2 L/minute 
      oxygen via a tight-fitting face mask. Pulse rate (in beats per minute), 
      respiratory rate (in breaths per minute) and SpO2 (in percentage) were measured 
      at baseline in left lateral recumbency and afterwards continuously after being 
      positioned in allocated surgical position. At the end of surgery, cats were 
      placed again in left recumbency, and all parameters were re-evaluated after five 
      minutes. Overall, 33 % of cats showed severe arterial oxygen desaturation (SpO2 < 
      90 %) at baseline when breathing room air. When oxygen was supplemented during 
      the procedure, arterial oxygen desaturation resolved in all cats. At the end of 
      the procedure, 29 % of cats were hypoxaemic when oxygen was not supplemented, 
      with an overall higher percentage of hypoxaemic cats in TR as compared to DR and 
      LR recumbencies. All cats recovered well from surgery and were released within 24 
      hours post-anaesthesia. Arterial oxygen desaturation is frequent in cats 
      anaesthetised with injectable anaesthesia for spay under field conditions. Oxygen 
      supplementation administered via a tight-fitting mask resolved arterial oxygen 
      desaturation in this feral cat population regardless of the surgical position and 
      therefore oxygen supplementation is recommended in any case.

TI  - Defining Intensivists: A Retrospective Analysis of the Published Studies in the 
      United States, 2010-2020.
PG  - 223-236
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000005984 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Society of Critical Care Medicine last published an intensivist 
      definition in 1992. Subsequently, there have been many publications relating to 
      intensivists. Our purpose is to assess how contemporary studies define 
      intensivist physicians. DESIGN: Systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of 
      Science (2010-2020) for publication titles with the terms intensivist, and 
      critical care or intensive care physician, specialist, or consultant. We included 
      studies focusing on adult U.S. intensivists and excluded non-data-driven reports, 
      non-U.S. publications, and pediatric or neonatal ICU reports. We aggregated the 
      study title intensivist nomenclatures and parsed Introduction and Method sections 
      to discern the text used to define intensivists. Fourteen parameters were found 
      and grouped into five definitional categories: A) No definition, B) Background 
      training and certification, C) Works in ICU, D) Staffing, and E) Database 
      related. Each study was re-evaluated against these parameters and grouped into 
      three definitional classes (single, multiple, or no definition). The prevalence 
      of each parameter is compared between groups using Fisher exact test. SETTING: 
      U.S. adult ICUs and databases. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN 
      RESULTS: Of 657 studies, 105 (16%) met inclusion criteria. Within the study 
      titles, 17 phrases were used to describe an intensivist; these were categorized 
      as intensivist in 61 titles (58%), specialty intensivist in 30 titles (29%), and 
      ICU/critical care physician in 14 titles (13%). Thirty-one studies (30%) used a 
      single parameter (B-E) as their definition, 63 studies (60%) used more than one 
      parameter (B-E) as their definition, and 11 studies (10%) had no definition (A). 
      The most common parameter "Works in ICU" (C) in 52 studies (50%) was more likely 
      to be used in conjunction with other parameters rather than as a standalone 
      parameter (multiple parameters vs single-parameter studies; 73% vs 17%; p < 
      0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: There was no consistency of intensivist nomenclature or 
      definitions in contemporary adult intensivist studies in the United States.

TI  - Health Communication and Behavioral Change During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
PG  - 612-623
LID - 10.1177/17456916231215272 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic challenged the public health system to respond to an 
      emerging, difficult-to-understand pathogen through demanding behaviors, including 
      staying at home, masking for long periods, and vaccinating multiple times. We 
      discuss key challenges of the pandemic health communication efforts deployed in 
      the United States from 2020 to 2022 and identify research priorities. One 
      priority is communicating about uncertainty in ways that prepare the public for 
      disagreement and likely changes in recommendations as scientific understanding 
      advances: How can changes in understanding and recommendations foster a sense 
      that "science works as intended" rather than "the experts are clueless" and 
      prevent creating a void to be filled by misinformation? A second priority 
      concerns creating a culturally fluent framework for asking people to engage in 
      difficult and novel actions: How can health messages foster the perception that 
      difficulties of behavior change signal that the change is important rather than 
      that the change "is not for people like me?" A third priority entails a shift 
      from communication strategies that focus on knowledge and attitudes to 
      interventions that focus on norms, policy, communication about policy, and 
      channel factors that impair behavior change: How can we move beyond educating and 
      correcting misinformation to achieving desired actions?

AB  - Deficiencies in the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene are the main cause of hereditary 
      breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA1 is involved in the Homologous Recombination DNA 
      repair pathway and, together with BARD1, forms a heterodimer with ubiquitin E3 
      activity. The relevance of the BRCA1/BARD1 ubiquitin E3 activity for tumor 
      suppression and DNA repair remains controversial. Here, we observe that the 
      BRCA1/BARD1 ubiquitin E3 activity is not required for Homologous Recombination or 
      resistance to Olaparib. Using TULIP2 methodology, which enables the direct 
      identification of E3-specific ubiquitination substrates, we identify substrates 
      for BRCA1/BARD1. We find that PCNA is ubiquitinated by BRCA1/BARD1 in unperturbed 
      conditions independently of RAD18. PCNA ubiquitination by BRCA1/BARD1 avoids the 
      formation of ssDNA gaps during DNA replication and promotes continuous DNA 
      synthesis. These results provide additional insight about the importance of 
      BRCA1/BARD1 E3 activity in Homologous Recombination.

TI  - Impact of Missense Mutations on Spike Protein Stability and Binding Affinity in 
      the Omicron Variant.
LID - 10.3390/v16071150 [doi]
LID - 1150
AB  - The global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic faces ongoing uncertainty with 
      the emergence of Variants of Concern featuring numerous mutations on the Spike 
      (S) protein. In particular, the Omicron Variant is distinguished by 32 mutations, 
      including 10 within its receptor-binding domain (RBD). These mutations 
      significantly impact viral infectivity and the efficacy of vaccines and 
      antibodies currently in use for therapeutic purposes. In our study, we employed 
      structure-based computational saturation mutagenesis approaches to predict the 
      effects of Omicron missense mutations on RBD stability and binding affinity, 
      comparing them to the original Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. Our results predict that 
      mutations such as G431W and P507W induce the most substantial destabilizations in 
      the Wuhan-Hu-1-S/Omicron-S RBD. Notably, we postulate that mutations in the 
      Omicron-S exhibit a higher percentage of enhancing binding affinity compared to 
      Wuhan-S. We found that the mutations at residue positions G447, Y449, F456, F486, 
      and S496 led to significant changes in binding affinity. In summary, our findings 
      may shed light on the widespread prevalence of Omicron mutations in human 
      populations. The Omicron mutations that potentially enhance their affinity for 
      human receptors may facilitate increased viral binding and internalization in 
      infected cells, thereby enhancing infectivity. This informs the development of 
      new neutralizing antibodies capable of targeting Omicron's immune-evading 
      mutations, potentially aiding in the ongoing battle against the COVID-19 
      pandemic.

TI  - Blood and urine biomarkers for the diagnosis of early stages of knee 
      osteoarthritis: A systematic review.
PG  - e12105
LID - 10.1002/jeo2.12105 [doi]
LID - e12105
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify biomarkers in human blood or urine at an early stage of knee 
      osteoarthritis (OA) and to elucidate if any can accurately differentiate between 
      healthy controls and early knee OA patients and be considered as a candidate for 
      widespread clinical use for early diagnosis of the disease. METHODS: Medline, 
      Embase and Web of Science were screened to identify comparative studies measuring 
      differences in blood or urine biomarkers between healthy controls and knee OA 
      patients at an early stage (grade 1 or 2 Kellgren-Laurence). Two independent 
      reviewers screened the abstracts for eligibility, reviewed the full texts, 
      assessed the methodological quality and extracted the data. The Joanna Briggs 
      Institute critical appraisal tool for diagnostic test accuracy studies was used 
      to assess the quality of the included studies. Due to relevant heterogeneity, 
      meta-analysis was not appropriate. RESULTS: Five studies met the eligibility 
      criteria. The examined biomarkers were adropin, collagen type II metabolite, 
      C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type II collagen, C-terminal cross-linked 
      telopeptide of type I collagen, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, matrix 
      metalloproteinase 3, N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type IIA, type I 
      procollagen N-terminal propeptides, N-terminal osteocalcin, angiopoietin-2, 
      follistatin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, hepatocyte growth factor, 
      interleukin-8, leptin, platelet-derived growth factor-BB, platelet endothelial 
      cell adhesion molecule-1, vascular endothelial growth factor and calprotectin and 
      totalling 19 biomarkers. All of the biomarkers were studied only once in the 
      selected papers. CONCLUSIONS: There is no reliable biomarker available to 
      differentiate between early knee OA in patients and healthy controls, but a 
      potential role of a cluster of biomarkers to close this gap. There are several 
      limitations, including inappropriate study designs, small sample sizes, 
      nonconsecutive patient groups and inadequate statistical methods for evaluating 
      biomarker performance in studies included. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

TI  - Quality and stability studies of red blood cell concentrates from umbilical cord 
      blood compared to their adult counterparts.
LID - 10.2450/BloodTransfus.761 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prematurity is a significant health issue due to its incidence and 
      associated complications. Anemia is common in extremely preterm infants (EPI) and 
      often requires transfusions. Red blood cells (RBC) from adult blood (AB) donors 
      have been linked to oxygen-related complications in EPI, leading to the 
      exploration of cord blood (CB) as an alternative source. However, standardization 
      of CB-RBC manufacturing and comparison with AB-RBC characteristics are necessary 
      before clinical studies can be conducted. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study 
      investigated the quality and characteristics of leukoreduced, gamma-irradiated 
      CB-RBC obtained using a commercial closed system from CB donations not meeting 
      hematopoietic transplantation criteria. CB-RBC units were compared with AB-RBC 
      units, both stored in saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol (SAGM). Various parameters, 
      including hematological and biochemical characteristics, pH, 2,3-DPG levels, 
      blood gases and potential toxicants, were evaluated during storage. RESULTS: 
      CB-RBC units had acceptable initial quality parameters and a hematocrit (55+/-2%) 
      comparable to AB-RBC. The main finding during storage was a faster rise in 
      hemolysis compared to AB-RBC. Potassium (K+) significantly increased during 
      storage in both sources. As expected, glucose levels decreased, and conversely, 
      lactate levels increased, indicating similar patterns of anaerobic glycolysis 
      during storage. pH decreased, affecting the oxygen dissociation curve due to 
      reduced 2,3-DPG levels. After irradiation at 14 days of storage, CB-RBC were less 
      stable as hemolysis and K+ significantly increased compared to AB-RBC at 24 
      hours. Phthalate concentrations, indicative of plasticizers, increased during 
      storage, but significantly less in CB compared to AB-RBC. Most metals measured 
      were within acceptable ranges. DISCUSSION: The quality of CB-RBC during storage 
      is primarily influenced by levels of hemolysis and extracellular K+ content. 
      Based on the analyzed parameters, we suggest that the expiration date for CB-RBC 
      stored with SAGM should be set at 14 days, with transfusion occurring within <24 
      hours after irradiation.
