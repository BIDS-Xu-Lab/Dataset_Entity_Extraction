        "abstract": "We have investigated in whole cells whether, at low oxygen concentrations ([O(2)]), endogenous nitric oxide (NO) modulates the redox state of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), and whether such an action has any signaling consequences. Using a polarographic-and-spectroscopic-coupled system, we monitored redox changes in the ETC cytochromes b(H), cc(1), and aa(3) during cellular respiration. The rate of O(2) consumption (VO(2)) remained constant until [O(2)] fell below 15 microM, whereas the onset of reduction of cytochromes aa(3), part of the terminal ETC enzyme cytochrome c oxidase, occurred at approximately 50 microM O(2). Incubation of the cells with an inhibitor of NO synthase lowered significantly (P < 0.05) the [O(2)] at which reduction of the cytochromes occurred. We also measured intracellular superoxide (O(2)(-)) production at different [O(2)] and found there was no increase in O(2)(-) generation in control cells, or those treated with the NO synthase inhibitor, when incubated at 21% O(2). However, after 30-min exposure of control cells to 3% O(2), an increase in O(2)(-) generation was observed, accompanied by translocation to the nucleus of the transcription factor NF-kappa B. Both of these responses were diminished by NO synthase inhibition. Our results suggest that endogenous NO, by enhancing the reduction of ETC cytochromes, contributes to a mechanism by which cells maintain their VO(2) at low [O(2)]. This, in turn, favors the release of O(2)(-), which initiates the transcriptional activation of NF-kappa B as an early signaling stress response.",

Structure-activity relationships at the dopamine transporter, for this series of compounds, have been derived and compared to those of cocaine and GBR 12909. These studies suggest that structurally diverse dopamine uptake inhibitors may access different binding domains on the dopamine transporter. The distinctive behavioral profile displayed in this series of compounds, as compared to cocaine and other dopamine uptake inhibitors, is of particular interest and is proposed to be relevant to the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of this class of tropane-based molecules.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTo assess the electromechanical properties of human knee articular cartilage with compression-induced streaming potentials for reliability among users and correlation with macroscopic and histological evaluation tools and sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) content.\n\n\nMETHODS\nStreaming potentials are induced in cartilage in response to loading when mobile positive ions in the interstitial fluid temporarily move away from negatively charged proteoglycans. Streaming potential integrals (SPIs) were measured with an indentation probe on femoral condyles of 10 human knee specimens according to a standardized location scheme. Interobserver reliability was measured using an interclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The learning curves of 3 observers were evaluated by regression analysis. At each SPI measurement location the degradation level of the tissue was determined by means of the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) score, Mankin score, and sGAG content.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe computed ICC was 0.77 (0.70-0.83) indicating good to excellent linear agreement of SPI values among the 3 users. A significant positive linear correlation of the learning index values was observed for 2 of the 3 users. Statistically significant negative correlations between SPI and both ICRS and Mankin scores were observed (r = 0.502, P < 0.001, and r = 0.255, P = 0.02, respectively). No correlation was observed between SPI and sGAG content (r = 0.004, P = 0.973).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSPI values may be used as a quantitative means of cartilage evaluation with sufficient reliability among users. Due to the significant learning curve, adequate training should be absolved before routine use of the technique.",

        "abstract": "Left ventricular hypertrophy and function were studied in 27 consecutive patients with chronic aortic valve disease before and 6.4 +/- 2.2 (S.D.) months after aortic valve replacement with Björk-Shiley prostheses. Four patients were excluded because of postoperative paravalvular regurgitation. Five patients had aortic stenosis (AS), seven patients AS plus insufficiency (AS-AI), and 11 patients aortic insufficiency (AI). Left ventricular muscle mass (LVMI), ejection fraction (EF), mean circumferential fiber shortening rate (VCF), mean normalized systolic ejection rate (MNSER), and peak systolic wall stress (PSWS) were determined angiographically. LVMI fell significantly after corrective surgery, whereas EF, VCF, and MNSER increased. PSWS decreased after the operation. Comparison of stress ventriculograms before and after surgery in six patients with predominant AS (isoproterenol infusion, 0.3 microgram per kilogram of body weight per minute) showed an increase of EF, VCF, and MNSER and a decrease of PSWS. We conclude that hypertrophy in chronic aortic valve disease regresses after aortic valve replacement, and thereby depressed cardiac function and reserve recover.",

To the best of our known, the strain owns the highest siderophore producing capacity among genus Burkholderia with 96.6% siderophore unit. Moreover, B. vietnamiensis YQ9 has good adaptability to different pH values, temperatures, NaCl, and Fe3+ concentrations. In addition, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of heavy metals and antibiotics were also tested. It was found that the MIC values of strain YQ9 to several major soil heavy metal pollutants, such as Pb2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+ reached 3000, 5000, 4500, and 1000 μmol·L-1, respectively. And YQ9 was sensitive to 4 of 8 test antibiotics, including rifampicin, kanamycin, doxycycline hyclate, and gentamicin (25, 25, 30, and 30 μg·mL-1, respectively). Strain YQ9 also owns the ability to produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase and dissolve phosphorus. The IAA production capacity was 6.93 mg·L-1, the ACC deaminase activity was 8.71 μmol α-KA·(h·mg)-1, and the phosphorus dissolving capacity of YQ9 was 104.05 mg·L-1. The traits were excellent, and the strain was qualified as a candidate for microbial reinforcement of phytoremediation in soil contaminated by heavy metals.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nCompared to the healthy population, the psychological impact of rheumatoid arthritis(RA) on patients' lives could dramatically lower their oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). Our goal is to analyze OHRQoL in RA patients and look into the role of disease activity, dental health index, and Temporomandibular disorders score in maintaining their oral health.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a cross-sectional comparative study, we compared a sample of 40 RA patients with 40 age- and gender-matched healthy controls in terms of oral health and OHRQoL. Temporomandibular disorders (TMD), number of decayed, filled, or missing teeth (DMFT), and Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP) were among the oral health factors studied (OHIP-14). This study also looked at the link between the RA disease activity score (DAS28) and oral health factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRA patients had a significantly higher mean (poorer OHRQol) than healthy controls in total oral function, total psychosocial impact, OHIP-14 sum score, OHIP-14 extent score, TMD score and the number of missed teeth (Mann-Whitney U test, P-value < 0.05). After adjustment for DMFT, only the oral function score of OHIP-14 had a significant correlation with disease activity (Mann-Whitney U test, P-value < 0.05). The TMD sum score significantly correlated with disease activity regardless of adjustment for DMFT (Spearman's Correlation test, P-value < 0.05 for both). The number of decayed teeth and missed teeth showed a positive correlation with increased disease activity (Coefficient = 0.239 and 0.245, P-value < 0.05 for both).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients with RA are less satisfied with their oral health than healthy controls. In RA patients, the number of missing teeth and temporomandibular disorders was substantially greater, and the number of missing teeth and temporomandibular diseases increased significantly with increased disease activity. Although OHRQoL was inversely connected with RA activity, after correcting for decaying, missing, and filled teeth, only the oral function score of OHIP-14 exhibited a slight connection to DAS28.",

This review aimed to describe current evidence regarding the association between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and impairment of glucose and lipid metabolism and also discusses potential public-health implications in light of the new DAA therapies and their availability at a global level. The excellent safety profile and efficacy of DAAs offer an exceptional opportunity to control the HCV pandemic at a global level and represent an opportunity for developing an operational research framework aimed at investigating the complex dynamics between host, pathogen and therapy that lead to metabolic damage in subjects with infectious diseases.",

In order to understand the mechanisms employed by NeuroAiD to bring about its neuroproliferative and neuroprotective effects, we investigated the impact of MLC901, a reformulated version of MLC601, on human neural progenitors undergoing neural differentiation at the molecular level by performing three independent microarray experiments. Functional annotations of the genes regulated by MLC901 that were associated with neurogenesis were found to be enriched. We also identified potential targets (FGF19, GALR2, MMP10, FGF3 and TDO2) of MLC901 that could promote neurogenesis and neuroprotection in the human brain. This work highlighted some interesting targets and offered some insights into the possible mechanism of action of MLC901.

        "abstract": "In the ascending colon of adult male rats, large accumulations of differentiated, mucous-type cells were observed which formed the deep one-half to one-third of the crypts almost exclusively. Mitotic activity was localized to the midcrypt, to columnar-type cells. The mucous-type cells were designated as \"deep crypt secretory\" (DCS), and their histological study was initiated. In the light microscope, the apical cytoplasm was distended with mucous vacuoles which stained differently from goblet cells after using periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), alcian blue, or a Masson stain. In electron-micrographs, a well-developed Golgi complex and rough edoplasmic reticulum in addition to a large number of electron-opaque vacuoles indicated active production of a glycoprotein. The midcrypt mitotic activity was further demonstrated by using the colchicine technique and 3H-thymidine radioautography. A gradual increase of mucus content and a decrease of nuclear and nucleolar size in the DCS cells from midcrypt to crypt base indicated that these cells originate in midcrypt and mature as they progress toward the crypt base. Cell counts showed that the number of cells constituting the crypts was about the same all along the colon, but the percentage of DCS cells varied: 33% in ascending and 21% in transverse colon. Only 5% and 8% deep-crypt mucous-type cells were found in descending colon and cecum, respectively; but these cells differed in appearance from the mature DCS cells. In conclusion, the presence of a large number of nonmitotic end cells with intense secretory activity has been ascertained for the deep crypts of the ascending colon. The exact relation of these cells to the vacuolated or other epithelial cell types remains for further study.",

        "abstract": "Tissue necrosis as a consequence of ischemia-reperfusion injury and oxidative damage is a leading cause of permanent disability and death worldwide. The complete mechanism by which cells undergo necrosis upon oxidative stress is not understood. In response to an oxidative insult, wild-type p53 has been implicated as a central regulatory component of the mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT), triggering necrosis. This process is associated with cellular stabilization and translocation of p53 into the mitochondrial matrix. Here, we probe the mechanism by which p53 activates the key mPT regulator cyclophilin D (CypD). We explore the involvement of Trap1, an Hsp90-related mitochondrial matrix protein and a member of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, and its ability to suppress mPT in a p53-dependent manner. Our study finds that catalytically active CypD causes strong aggregation of wild-type p53 protein (both full-length and isolated DNA-binding domain) into amyloid-type fibrils in vitro. The responsible CypD residues for this activity were mapped by NMR to the active site amino acids R55, F60, F113, and W121. The data also present a new proline isomerization assay for CypD by monitoring the aggregation of p53 as an indicator of CypD activity. Moreover, we find that the inhibition of Trap1 by the mitochondria-specific HSP90 ATPase antagonist Gamitrinib strongly sensitizes primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts to mPT and permeability transition pore opening in a p53- and CypD-dependent manner. We propose a mechanism by which the influx of unfolded p53 into the mitochondrial matrix in response to oxidative stress indirectly activates the normally inhibited CypD by displacing it from Trap1 complexes. This activates CypD's isomerase activity. Liberated CypD then isomerizes multiple proteins including p53 (causing p53 aggregation) and the structural components of the mPTP pore, inducing pore opening. This working model can now be tested in the future.",

The aim of this study was to ascertain whether it is possible to optimise outcome with the implantation of both an adjustable valve and a gravitational unit.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBetween July 2003 and July 2006, 42 patients underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery with a Codman Hakim programmable valve (Codman, Johnson & Johnson, Raynham, USA) and a Miethke ShuntAssistant (Miethke Gmbh, Potsdam, Germany). These patients were followed up for a period between 2 years (35 patients) and 4 years (18 patients) after surgery.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe systematic re-programming of the valves from 100 mmH(2)O to 70 mmH(2)O and then to 50 mmH(2)O after 3 months allowed the brain to adapt to the implanted valve without the complication of overdrainage. The responder rates were 86% after two years and 83% after four years. Overdrainage was seen in 3% of the cases, mechanical complications occurred in 6%.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur results indicate that the combination of a Codman Hakim programmable valve with a Miethke ShuntAssistant could improve outcomes in shunted iNPH. This finding has yet to be proven in a larger, prospective randomized trial.",

        "title": "Biomechanical loading as an alternative treatment for tremor: a review of two approaches.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTremor is the most common movement disorder and strongly increases in incidence and prevalence with aging. Although not life threatening, upper-limb tremors hamper the independence of 65% of people suffering from them affected persons, greatly impacting their quality of life. Current treatments include pharmacotherapy and surgery (thalamotomy and deep brain stimulation). However, these options are not sufficient for approximately 25% of patients. Therefore, further research and new therapeutic options are required to effectively manage pathological tremor.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis paper presents findings of two research projects in which two different wearable robots for tremor management were developed based on force loading and validated. The first consisted of a robotic exoskeleton that applied forces to tremulous limbs and consistently attenuated mild and severe tremors. The second was a neuroprosthesis based on transcutaneous neurostimulation. A total of 22 patients suffering from parkinsonian or essential tremor (ET) of different severities were recruited for experimental validation, and both systems were evaluated using standard tasks employed for neurological examination. The inclusion criterion was a postural and/or kinetic pathological upper-limb tremor resistant to medication.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results demonstrate that both approaches effectively suppressed tremor in most patients, although further research is required. The work presented here is based on clinical evidence from a small number of patients (n = 10 for robotic exoskeleton and n = 12 for the neuroprosthesis), but most had a positive response to the approaches. In summary, biomechanical loading is non-invasive and painless. It may be effective in patients who are insufficiently responsive (or have adverse reactions) to drugs or in whom surgery is contraindicated.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThis paper identifies and evaluates biomechanical loading approaches to tremor management and discusses their potential.",

        "abstract": "Gene duplication confers genetic redundancy that can facilitate subfunctionalization, the partitioning of ancestral functions between paralogs. We capitalize on a recent genome duplication in Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog) to interrogate possible functional differentiation between alloalleles of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates toxicity of dioxin-like compounds and plays a role in the physiology and development of the cardiovascular, hepatic, and immune systems in vertebrates. X. laevis has 2 AHR genes, AHR1α and AHR1β To test the hypothesis that the encoded proteins exhibit different molecular functions, we used TALENs in XLK-WG cells, generating mutant lines lacking functional versions of each AHR and measuring the transcriptional responsiveness of several target genes to the toxic xenobiotic 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and the candidate endogenous ligand 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ). Mutation of either AHR1α or AHR1β reduced TCDD induction of the canonical AHR target, Cytochrome P4501A6, by 75%, despite the much lower abundance of AHR1β in wild-type cells. More modestly induced target genes, encoding aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR), spectrin repeat-containing nuclear envelope protein 1 (SYNE-1), and gap junction protein gamma 1 (GJC1), were regulated solely by AHR1α. AHR1β was responsible for CYP1A6 induction by FICZ, while AHR1α mediated FICZ induction of AHRR We conclude that AHR1α and AHR1β have distinct transcriptional functions in response to specific agonists, even within a single cell type. Functional analysis of frog AHR paralogs advances the understanding of AHR evolution and as well as the use of frog models of developmental toxicology such as FETAX.",

Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum audouinii and Trichophyton schoenleinii acted as the major pathogens of superficial fungal diseases 100 years ago, but their frequency decreased dramatically since the middle of the twentieth century and they are limited to some less-developed countries nowadays; meanwhile, frequency of Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton interdigitale, Trichophyton tonsurans and Microsporum canis increased gradually, and these fungi have become the major species globally. Some other dermatophytes, i.e., Trichophyton violaceum, Trichophyton verrucosum and Microsporum ferrugineum, are mainly endemic in some parts of Africa, Asia and Europe. At present, T. rubrum is the leading pathogen for skin and nail fungal infections, whereas M. canis, T. tonsurans and T. violaceum present as the predominant dermatophytes involved in tinea capitis. Population mobility, changes in human lifestyle and advents of antifungal drugs will continually drive the dermatophyte evolution in the skin microenvironment.

As the lead professional, the midwife must use a high level of professional judgement, clinical reasoning and decision-making to enable choice while ensuring the safety and wellbeing of mother and infant. Delayed development of these cognitive skills is suggested by the continuing theory-practice gap, suboptimal practice and students requiring to conform to non-evidence-based practice. The purpose of this research was to explore midwifery students' understanding and experience of the development of cognitive skills. The research employed analysis of undergraduate midwifery programme documentation and a focus group discussion with student midwives from second and third year of the programme. Document analysis and thematic analysis of the interview data indicated a lack of emphasis on cognitive skill development and a sense that these skills improve naturally through exposure to clinical practice. The findings suggest a need to change our approach to learning in clinical practice and to conduct further research to improve understanding of mechanisms to support the development of cognitive skills.",

        "abstract": "Selective protein recognition is critical in molecular biology techniques such as Western blotting and ELISA. Successful detection of the target proteins in these methods relies on the specific interaction of the antibodies, which often bring a high production cost and require a long incubation time. Aptamers represent an alternative class of simple and affordable affinity reagents for protein recognition, and replacing antibodies with aptamers in Western blotting would potentially be more time- and cost-effective. In this work, multiple fluorescent DNA aptamers were isolated by in vitro selection to selectively label commonly used tag proteins including GST, MBP, and His-tag. The generated aptamers G1, M1, and H1 specifically bound to their cognate target proteins with nanomolar affinities, respectively. Compared with conventional antibody-based immunoblotting, such aptamer-based procedure gave a cleaner background and was able to selectively label target protein in a complex mixture. Lastly, the identified aptamers were also effective in recognition of different fusion proteins with the same tag, thus greatly expanding the scope of the potential applications of these aptamers. This work provided aptamers as useful molecular tools for selective protein recognition in Western blotting analysis.",

The ability to adequately nourish the human body to sustain the required level of competitive performance may be a key contributor to success in such events.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe energy expenditure of a male competitor in a single-handed, transatlantic race (Transat 2004) was assessed using the doubly-labelled water technique.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) during the race (13 days) was 14.5 MJ/day with a peak expenditure of 18.6 MJ during the most physically demanding 24-hour period.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThis mean TDEE was approximately 25% lower than that reported in a previous study (14.5 vs. 19.3 MJ/day) for a 13-day leg of a fully crewed offshore race. The difference in results was probably due to the fact that in the previous study, the crew operated in \"watches\" (work shifts), affording each crew member greater opportunity to eat, rest and sleep. Effective planning and efficient management of resources is essential to the success of the solo sailor. However, the extent to which maintenance of energy balance underpins competitive success remains to be established. To maintain energy balance during the race, a mean daily energy intake of 14.5 MJ/day was necessary for the subject in this study. However, this mean value for energy intake would have been inadequate to match the peak energy expended during the most physically demanding 24 hours of the race.",

        "abstract": "All methods proposed to date for mapping landmark configurations on a phylogenetic tree start from an alignment generated by methods that make no use of phylogenetic information, usually by superimposing all configurations against a consensus configuration. In order to properly interpret differences between landmark configurations along the tree as changes in shape, the metric chosen to define the ancestral assignments should also form the basis to superimpose the configurations. Thus, we present here a method that merges both steps, map and align, into a single procedure that (for the given tree) produces a multiple alignment and ancestral assignments such that the sum of the Euclidean distances between the corresponding landmarks along tree nodes is minimized. This approach is an extension of the method proposed by Catalano et al. (2010. Phylogenetic morphometrics (I): the use of landmark data in a phylogenetic framework. Cladistics. 26:539-549) for mapping landmark data with parsimony as optimality criterion. In the context of phylogenetics, this method allows maximizing the degree to which similarity in landmark positions can be accounted for by common ancestry. In the context of morphometrics, this approach guarantees (heuristics aside) that all the transformations inferred on the tree represent changes in shape. The performance of the method was evaluated on different data sets, indicating that the method produces marked improvements in tree score (up to 5% compared with generalized superimpositions, up to 11% compared with ordinary superimpositions). These empirical results stress the importance of incorporating the phylogenetic information into the alignment step.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT\nMedical schools are challenged to create academic environments that stimulate students to improve their study progress without compromising their well-being.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nThis prospective comparative cohort study investigated the effects of raising Year-1 standards on academic performance and on students' chronic psychological and biological stress levels.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a Dutch medical school, students within the last Bachelor's degree cohort (n = 410) exposed to the 40/60 (67%) credit Year-1 standard (67%-credit cohort) were compared with students within the first cohort (n = 413) exposed to a 60/60 (100%) credit standard (100%-credit cohort). Main outcome measures were Year-1 pass rate (academic performance), mean score on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS, psychological stress) and hair cortisol concentration (HCC, biological stress).\n\n\nRESULTS\nYear-1 pass rates were significantly higher in the 100%-credit cohort (odds ratio [OR] 4.65). Interestingly, there was a significant interaction effect (OR 0.46), indicating that raising the standard was more effective for male than for female students. PSS scores (n = 234 [response rate [RR]: 57%] and n = 244 [RR: 59%] in the 67%- and 100%-credit cohorts, respectively) were also significantly higher in the 100%-credit cohort (F(1,474)  = 15.08, P < .001). This applied specifically to female students in the 100%-credit cohort. Levels of HCC (n = 181 [RR: 44%] and n = 162 [RR: 39%] respectively) did not differ between cohorts, but were significantly higher in female students (F(1,332)  = 7.93, P < .01). In separate models including cohort and gender, both PSS score (OR 0.91) and HCC (OR 0.38) were significantly associated with Year-1 performance. Only students with both high PSS scores and high HCC values were significantly at risk of lower Year-1 pass rates (OR 0.27), particularly male students.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRaising the Year-1 performance standard increased academic performance, most notably in male students. However, it also increased levels of perceived stress, especially in female students. In particular, the combination of high levels of perceived stress and biological stress, as measured by long-term cortisol, was related to poor academic performance. The study suggests a relationship between raising performance standards and student well-being, with differential effects in male and female students.",

        "abstract": "Voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels play key roles in the excitability of skeletal muscle fibers. In this study we investigated the steady-state and kinetic properties of voltage-gated Na+ and K+ currents of slow and fast skeletal muscle fibers in zebrafish ranging in age from 1 day postfertilization (dpf) to 4-6 dpf. The inner white (fast) fibers possess an A-type inactivating K+ current that increases in peak current density and accelerates its rise and decay times during development. As the muscle matured, the V50s of activation and inactivation of the A-type current became more depolarized, and then hyperpolarized again in older animals. The activation kinetics of the delayed outward K+ current in red (slow) fibers accelerated within the first week of development. The tail currents of the outward K+ currents were too small to allow an accurate determination of the V50s of activation. Red fibers did not show any evidence of inward Na+ currents; however, white fibers expressed Na+ currents that increased their peak current density, accelerated their inactivation kinetics, and hyperpolarized their V50 of inactivation during development. The action potentials of white fibers exhibited significant changes in the threshold voltage and the half width. These findings indicate that there are significant differences in the ionic current profiles between the red and white fibers and that a number of changes occur in the steady-state and kinetic properties of Na+ and K+ currents of developing zebrafish skeletal muscle fibers, with the most dramatic changes occurring around the end of the first day following egg fertilization.",

        "abstract": "Due to chromatic aberration, blue images are defocused when the eye is focused to the middle of the visible spectrum, yet we normally are not aware of chromatic blur. The eye suffers from monochromatic aberrations which degrade the optical quality of all images projected on the retina. The combination of monochromatic and chromatic aberrations is not additive and these aberrations may interact to improve image quality. Using Adaptive Optics, we investigated the optical and visual effects of correcting monochromatic aberrations when viewing polychromatic grayscale, green, and blue images. Correcting the eye's monochromatic aberrations improved optical quality of the focused green images and degraded the optical quality of defocused blue images, particularly in eyes with higher amounts of monochromatic aberrations. Perceptual judgments of image quality tracked the optical findings, but the perceptual impact of the monochromatic aberrations correction was smaller than the optical predictions. The visual system appears to be adapted to the blur produced by the native monochromatic aberrations, and possibly to defocus in blue.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nCorneal allograft rejection in rats can be prevented by subconjunctival injections of liposomes containing dichloromethylene diphosphonate (clodronate-LIP), which selectively eliminate macrophages. In this study, the effect of clodronate-LIP treatment on cytokine mRNA levels in corneal allografts was examined.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAO rats received corneal grafts of PVG rats. Rats were either not treated or injected subconjunctivally with clodronate-LIP on the day of transplantation and on postoperative days (PODs) 2, 4, 6, and 8. RNA was isolated from the graft and rim of corneas at different times after transplantation and from normal controls. Interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, TNF-beta/lymphotoxin (LT), interferon (IFN)-gamma, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2) mRNA levels were analyzed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).\n\n\nRESULTS\nCorneal rejection, observed in all untreated rats by POD 12, was associated with increased mRNA levels of all cytokines investigated in grafts and rims. Clodronate-LIP treatment prevented allograft rejection and strongly decreased the levels of IL-1beta, IL-1RA, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-gamma, TNF-beta/LT, MCP-1, and MIP-2 mRNA in grafts and IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IFN-gamma mRNA in rims. Interleukin-12p40 mRNA levels were unaltered in clodronate-treated rats, except for a transient increase in grafts at POD 3. TNF-alpha mRNA levels were increased by clodronate-LIP in grafts and rims early after transplantation (PODs 3 and 7). Despite a normal appearance, long-term accepted corneal grafts (POD 100) contained mRNA for IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-alpha, MCP-1, and MIP-2.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nClodronate-liposome treatment markedly altered the mRNA levels of all cytokines investigated in corneal allografts. These results may explain in part the mechanism by which clodronate-LIP treatment prevents corneal allograft rejection.",

        "abstract": "Invasive plant species both threaten native biodiversity and are economically costly, but only a few naturalized species become pests. Here we report broad, quantitative support for two long-standing hypotheses that explain why only some naturalized species have large impacts. The enemy release hypothesis argues that invaders' impacts result from reduced natural enemy attack. The biotic resistance hypothesis argues that interactions with native species, including natural enemies, limit invaders' impacts. We tested these hypotheses for viruses and for rust, smut and powdery mildew fungi that infect 473 plant species naturalized to the United States from Europe. On average, 84% fewer fungi and 24% fewer virus species infect each plant species in its naturalized range than in its native range. In addition, invasive plant species that are more completely released from pathogens are more widely reported as harmful invaders of both agricultural and natural ecosystems. Together, these results strongly support the enemy release hypothesis. Among noxious agricultural weeds, species accumulating more pathogens in their naturalized range are less widely noxious, supporting the biotic resistance hypothesis. Our results indicate that invasive plants' impacts may be a function of both release from and accumulation of natural enemies, including pathogens.",

We tested associations of maternal 25(OH)D3 concentration with pregnancy and birth outcomes.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preterm delivery, caesarean section, fetal growth restriction (FGR) and small-for-gestational age (SGA), anthropometric birth outcomes including weight, length and head circumference (HC).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, 31.8% and 19.7% of women had vitamin D insufficiency [25(OH)D3 20-29.99 ng/ml] and deficiency [25(OH)D3 < 20 ng/ml], respectively. After adjustment, there was no association between maternal 25(OH)D3 concentration and risk of GDM or preterm delivery. Women with sufficient vitamin D [25(OH)D3 ≥ 30 ng/ml] had a decreased risk of caesarean section by obstructed labour compared with women with vitamin D deficiency [relative risk (RR) = 0.60, 95% CI 0.37, 0.97). Offspring of mothers with higher circulating 25(OH)D3 concentration tended to have smaller HC [coefficient (SE) per doubling concentration of 25(OH)D3, -0.10 (0.05), P = 0.038]. No significant associations were found for other birth outcomes.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study did not find any evidence of an association between vitamin D status in pregnancy and GDM, preterm delivery, FGR, SGA and anthropometric birth outcomes. Results suggest that sufficient circulating vitamin D concentration [25(OH)D3 ≥ 30 ng/ml] in pregnancy may reduce the risk of caesarean section by obstructed labour.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAnalogous to organ injury scales developed for trauma, a scoring system is needed for acute care surgery. The purpose of this study was to develop a disease severity score (DSS) for acute appendicitis, the most common surgical emergency.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA panel of acute care surgery experts reviewed the literature and developed a DSS for acute appendicitis as follows: grade 1, inflamed; Grade 2, gangrenous; Grade 3, perforated with localized free fluid; Grade 4, perforated with a regional abscess; and Grade 5, perforated with diffuse peritonitis. We applied the DSS to 1,000 consecutive patients undergoing appendectomy from 1999 to 2009 and examined its association with outcomes (mortality, length of hospital stay, incidence of in-hospital, and postdischarge complications). Of the 1,000 patients, 82 were excluded owing to negative or interval appendectomy or advanced end-stage renal disease.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong 918 eligible patients, the DSS distribution was Grade 1 at 62.4%, Grade 2 at 13.0%, Grade 3 at 18.7%, Grade 4 at 4.4%, and Grade 5 at 1.5%. Statistical analyses indicated a stepwise risk increase in adverse outcomes with higher DSS grades (c statistics ≥ 0.75 for all outcomes). Covariates (age, sex, and type of surgical access) did not add to the predictive power of DSS.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBased on this single-institution study, the proposed appendicitis DSS seems to be a useful tool. This DSS can inform future, national efforts, which can build on the knowledge provided by the present investigation. This DSS may be useful for comparing therapeutic modalities, planning resource use, improving programs, and adjusting reimbursement\n\n\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE\nEpidemiologic study, level III.",

Presently used physicochemical treatments, such as electrochemical oxidation, nanofiltration and reverse osmosis, are not feasible owing to high operating costs, incomplete removal of contaminants along with toxic by-products formation. Adsorption with the utilization of facile and efficient nanoparticulate adsorbents having distinctive properties of high surface area, excellent adsorption capacity, ability to undergo surface engineering and good regeneration displays great potential in this aspect along with the incorporation of nanotechnology for effective treatment. The application of such nanosorbents provides optimal performance under a wide range of physicochemical conditions, decreased secondary pollution with reduced mechanical stress along with excellent organic compound sequestration capacity, which in turn improves the quality of potable water in a sustainable way compared to current treatments.

        "abstract": "In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the G1 cyclins Cln1, Cln2 and Cln3 regulate entry into the cell cycle (Start) by activating the Cdc28 protein kinase. We find that Cln3 is a much rarer protein than Cln1 or Cln2 and has a much weaker associated histone H1 kinase activity. Unlike Cln1 and Cln2, Cln3 is not significantly cell cycle regulated, nor is it down-regulated by mating pheromone-induced G1 arrest. An artificial burst of CLN3 expression early in G1 phase accelerates Start and rapidly induces at least five other cyclin genes (CLN1, CLN2, HCS26, ORFD and CLB5) and the cell cycle-specific transcription factor SWI4. In similar experiments, CLN1 is less efficient than CLN3 at activating Start. Strikingly, expression of HCS26, ORFD and CLB5 is dependent on CLN3 in a cln1 cln2 strain, possibly explaining why CLN3 is essential in the absence of CLN1 and CLN2. To explain the potent ability of Cln3 to activate Start, despite its apparently weak biochemical activity, we propose that Cln3 may be an upstream activator of the G1 cyclins which directly catalyze Start. Given the large number of known cyclins, such cyclin cascades may be a common theme in cell cycle control.",

We evaluated complement deposition at 48 hours by flow cytometry after staining with the C3 anti-goat cy3 antibody. The inhibition of proliferation of porcine corneal cells by human sera was examined using the 3-[4,5-dimethy/thiazol-2,5-dephenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay over 24 to 72 hours. The amount of 51chromium (Cr)-release was estimated after a reaction between the porcine cells and human PBMCs for 4 hours. There was greater C3 deposition in keratocytes (60.2%) than in endothelial cells (26.9%; P = .05, Mann-Whitney U test). Both keratocytes and endothelial cells showed significant levels of proliferative inhibition over a period of 72 hours. The number of 51Cr-release cells on interleukin-2 addition was significantly higher among keratocytes (88.0%) than endothelial cells (51.4%) at a 1:100 target:effector ratio (P = .04, Mann-Whitney U test).

Hypersensitive site 2 (HS2, serving as a major enhancer of globin genes)-binding proteins may be involved in its natural open chromosomal environment formation. Previously we prepared monoclonal antibodies against HS2-binding nuclear proteins of terminal differentiated erythroid cells. By utilizing the monoclonal antibodies, we screened lambda-gt11 human fetal liver cDNA expression library and obtained one cDNA clone, which was named erythroid differentiation related gene (EDRF1, Genbank accession number AF040247), encompassing an entire open reading frame. We investigated the expression pattern of EDRF1 by RT-PCR technique. And a clue to the function of EDRF1 has been found from confirmation of high levels of EDRF1 mRNA in differentiated K562 and human fetal liver tissue. To illuminate the function of EDRF1 in K562 cells, sense and antisense EDRF1 constructs were prepared and transfected into K562 cells. alpha-globin mRNA was down-regulated and EpoR (erythropoietin receptor) mRNA expression was increased in antisense transfected cells. Cells transfected with sense construct grew more slowly than control cells suggested by [(3)H] thimidine incorporation experiments. Suppression of K562 proliferation was accompanied by increased spontaneous hemoglobin synthesis demonstrated by spectrometry. K562 cells transfected with sense construct exhibited reduced clongenicity compared with control cells in methycellulose culture. These data provided the evidence that EDRF1 can influence globin expression and hemoglobin synthesis in K562 cells and modulated self-renewal in K562 cells.",

        "abstract": "Plant metabolites are important traits for plant breeders seeking to improve nutrition and agronomic performance yet integrating selection for metabolomic traits can be limited by phenotyping expense and degree of genetic characterization, especially of uncommon metabolites. As such, developing generalizable genomic selection methods based on biochemical pathway biology for metabolites that are transferable across plant populations would benefit plant breeding programs. We tested genomic prediction accuracy for >600 metabolites measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in oat (Avena sativa L.) seed. Using a discovery germplasm panel, we conducted metabolite genome-wide association study (mGWAS) and selected loci to use in multikernel models that encompassed metabolome-wide mGWAS results or mGWAS from specific metabolite structures or biosynthetic pathways. Metabolite kernels developed from LC-MS metabolites in the discovery panel improved prediction accuracy of LC-MS metabolite traits in the validation panel consisting of more advanced breeding lines. No approach, however, improved prediction accuracy for GC-MS metabolites. We ranked model performance by metabolite and found that metabolites with similar polarity had consistent rankings of models. Overall, testing biological rationales for developing kernels for genomic prediction across populations contributes to developing frameworks for plant breeding for metabolite traits.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS\nLow folate intake may increase risk of colorectal cancer by altering gene-specific methylation in the colon. We determined whether supplementation with physiological doses of folate could alter methylation in the oestrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and mutL homolog 1 (MLH1) genes in colonic mucosa of subjects with colorectal adenoma.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects received either 400 µg/day folic acid (n = 15) or placebo (n = 14) for 10 weeks. Blood and colonic tissue samples were collected at baseline and after intervention to determine biomarkers of folate and vitamin B12 status, MTHFR C677T and MS A2756G genotypes, and ESR1 and MLH1 methylation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlthough serum and red cell folate increased (p < 0.001 vs. placebo) and plasma homocysteine decreased (p = 0018 vs. placebo) in the folic acid group, there were no significant changes in ESR1 (p = 0.649 vs. placebo) or MLH1 (p = 0.211 vs. placebo) methylation. There was a significant effect of gender on ESR1 methylation (p = 0.004) and significant gender and genotype (MTHFR C677T and MS A2756G) interactions (p = 0.04 and p = 0.014, respectively) that were independent of treatment group allocation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nShort-term folate supplementation in physiological doses decreases plasma homocysteine but has no effect on ESR1 and MLH1 methylation in colonic mucosa of individuals with adenoma. Further studies to investigate the interactions between gender, genotype and DNA methylation suggested in this study are warranted.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality throughout the world, and is clearly linked to viral infections. Mass vaccination programs against hepatitis B virus have reduced the incidence of HCC in Taiwanese children, and are likely to yield similar benefits elsewhere. In many countries, a definite increase in the incidence of HCC has been reported, largely attributable to the increasing incidence of hepatitis C virus infection. Although the major viral and environmental risk factors for the development of HCC have been determined, the oncogenic pathways leading to malignant transformation of liver cells have long remained obscure. HCC is also extremely difficult to manage. Although patients at risk can be identified and early detection of HCC is feasible, the current management of HCC is confusing due to the lack of well-designed, randomized clinical trials comparing various treatment modalities. New surgical techniques and postoperative therapies may improve the outcome in some resectable cancers; however, the vast majority of patients have unresectable tumors. Local ablation treatments may shrink or necrose tumors, but the clear benefit of such therapies remains to be seen. Further elucidation of the genetic and molecular features of HCC may lend insight that will lead to the development of innovative strategies to manage this cancer. In this article, the current understanding of HCC with respect to etiologic factors, genetic mechanisms responsible for hepatocarcinogenesis, diagnosis, therapy, and prevention are reviewed.",

        "abstract": "Flexible sensors are highly advantageous for integration in portable and wearable devices. In this work, we propose and validate a simple strategy to achieve whole wafer-size flexible SERS substrate via a one-step metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE). A pre-patterning Si wafer allows for PSi structures to form in tens of microns areas, and thus enables easy detachment of PSi film pieces from bulk Si substrates. The morphology, porosity, and pore size of PS films can be precisely controlled by varying the etchant concentration, which shows obvious effects on film integrity and wettability. The cracks and self-peeling of Psi films can be achieved by the drying conditions after MACE, enabling transfer of Psi films from Si wafer to any substrates, while maintaining their original properties and vertical alignment. After coating with a thin layer of silver (Ag), the rigid and flexible PSi films before and after transfer both show obvious surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect. Moreover, flexible PSi films SERS substrates have been demonstrated with high sensitivity (down to 2.6 × 10-9 g/cm2) for detection of methyl parathion (MPT) residues on a curved apple surface. Such a method provides us with quick and high throughput fabrication of nanostructured materials for sensing, catalysis, and electro-optical applications.",

        "abstract": "Cancer vaccination using tumor antigen-primed dendritic cells (DCs) was introduced in the clinic some 25 years ago, but the overall outcome has not lived up to initial expectations. In addition to the complexity of the immune response, there are many factors that determine the efficacy of DC therapy. These include accurate administration of DCs in the target tissue site without unwanted cell dispersion/backflow, sufficient numbers of tumor antigen-primed DCs homing to lymph nodes (LNs), and proper timing of immunoadjuvant administration. To address these uncertainties, proton (1H) and fluorine (19F) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tracking of ex vivo pre-labeled DCs can now be used to non-invasively determine the accuracy of therapeutic DC injection, initial DC dispersion, systemic DC distribution, and DC migration to and within LNs. Magnetovaccination is an alternative approach that tracks in vivo labeled DCs that simultaneously capture tumor antigen and MR contrast agent in situ, enabling an accurate quantification of antigen presentation to T cells in LNs. The ultimate clinical premise of MRI DC tracking would be to use changes in LN MRI signal as an early imaging biomarker to predict the efficacy of tumor vaccination and anti-tumor response long before treatment outcome becomes apparent, which may aid clinicians with interim treatment management.",

As compared with the control day, after the marathon, baseline FFA concentration (543 +/- 0.73 vs. 955 +/- 96 mumol L-1, P < 0.05), lipid oxidation rate (0.8 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.1 mg kg-1 min-1, P < 0.01) and energy expenditure (5.2 +/- 0.1 vs. 5.5 +/- 0.1 kJ min-1, P < 0.01) were elevated. Baseline serum leptin concentrations were similar on the control and postexercise days and increased during insulin infusion by 35-45% on both days (P < or = 0.01). Baseline serum leptin concentration correlated directly with serum insulin (r = 0.65, P < 0.05) and cortisol (r = 0.64, P < 0.05), and inversely with serum growth hormone concentration (r = -0.66, P < 0.05). In the postexercise study, the rise in energy expenditure during insulin clamp correlated with serum leptin concentration as determined before (r = 0.61, P < 0.05) or at the end of insulin infusion (r = 0.55, P < 0.05). Thus, in healthy individuals with normal body weight: (1) hyperinsulinaemia increases serum leptin concentrations; (2) a rise in energy expenditure correlates with serum leptin concentration.

With a sample of 505 young men living in the rural South of the United States, a dual mediation model was tested in which retrospective reports of involvement from biological fathers and social fathers were linked to young men's substance misuse and multiple sexual partnerships through men's relational schemas and future expectations. Results from structural equation modeling indicated that levels of involvement from biological fathers and social fathers predicted young men's relational schemas; only biological fathers' involvement predicted future expectations. In turn, future expectations predicted levels of substance misuse, and negative relational schemas predicted multiple sexual partnerships. Biological fathers' involvement evinced significant indirect associations with young men's substance misuse and multiple sexual partnerships through both schemas and expectations; social fathers' involvement exhibited an indirect association with multiple sexual partnerships through relational schemas. Findings highlight the unique influences of biological fathers and social fathers on multiple domains of African American young men's psychosocial development that subsequently render young men more or less likely to engage in risk behaviors.",

This study aimed to observe the effects of 1,1-dimethyl-4-diphenylacetoxypiperidinium iodide (4-DAMP; a selective M3 receptor antagonist) on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced AR guinea pigs, and to explore its potential mechanism of involvement.\n\n\nMethods\nAn AR model was established by inducing male guinea pigs (4-6 weeks of age) with OVA. AR guinea pigs were randomly divided into a model group, 0.6 mg/kg ipratropium bromide (IB) group, 0.12 and 0.6 mg/kg 4-DAMP group (n=18). The 0.6 mg/kg IB group, 0.12 and 0.6 mg/kg 4-DAMP group animals were treated with IB (0.6 mg/kg) and 4-DAMP (0.12 or 0.6 mg/kg) by intranasal instillation per nostril daily. Animals in the model group and normal group were treated with saline as control. The AR symptom scores were counted and nasal secretion weights were measured. Histopathological methods were used to observe nasal mucosa. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the levels of histamine and cytokines. Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were used to detect the expressions of mucin 5AC (MUC5AC), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).\n\n\nResults\nCompared with model group animals, the AR symptom scores and nasal secretion weights of animals treated with 4-DAMP were reduced significantly, goblet cell metaplasia was reversed, and eosinophil infiltration was visibly alleviated. The levels of histamine and cytokines in nasal lavage fluid (NLF) were decreased, and the protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of MUC5AC, MMP9, and EGFR were inhibited.\n\n\nConclusions\nTreatment with 4-DAMP has a certain effect on AR, especially for mucus hypersecretion, which provides a new idea for clinical treatment of AR.",

Ophthalmic and anthropometric examinations were undertaken on all participants at baseline, and a questionnaire was administered, including medical and ophthalmic history. Participants were retraced in 2013-2014 for a second examination. Vital status was recorded for all participants through information from community members. Cumulative incidence of mortality, and its relationship with baseline VI and types of eye disease was estimated. Inverse probability weighting was used to adjust for non-participation.\n\n\nPRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES\nCumulative incidence of mortality in relation to VI level at baseline.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the baseline sample, 2170 (50%) were re-examined at follow-up and 407 (10%) were known to have died (adjusted risk of 11.9% over 6 years). Compared to those with normal vision (visual acuity (VA) ≥6/12, risk=9.7%), the 6-year mortality risk was higher among people with VI (<6/18 to ≥6/60; risk=28.3%; risk ratio (RR) 1.75, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.40) or severe VI (SVI)/blindness (<6/60; risk=34.9%; RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.80). These associations remained after adjustment for non-communicable disease (NCD) risk factors (mortality: RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.15; SVI/blind: RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.68). Mortality risk was also associated with presence of diabetic retinopathy at baseline (RR 3.18, 95% CI 1.98 to 5.09), cataract (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.66) and presence of both cataract and VI (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.98).

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nI(Ks), the slow component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, underlies a strong beta-adrenergic regulation in the heart. Catecholamines, like isoproterenol, induce a strong increase in I(Ks). Recent work has pointed to an opposing biological effect of beta(1)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptors in the heart. However the role of these subtypes in the regulation of cardiac ion channel function is unknown.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe investigated the effects of beta(1)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptor modulation on I(Ks) in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes, using patch-clamp techniques.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSuperfusion with 100 nmol/l isoproterenol increased the step current amplitude by 81.3+/-8.0%. In contrast, after block of beta(1)- (1 micromol/l atenolol) and beta(2)-receptors (1 micromol/l ICI118,551), isoproterenol induced a reduction of the step current amplitude by 34.3+/-3.5%. The beta(3)-selective agonist BRL37344 significantly reduced the I(Ks) step current at +70 mV in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50): 5.01 nmol/l). In the presence of bupranolol (beta(1)-, beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist), the effect of BRL37344 was markedly attenuated, from 27.3+/-5.6% (100 nmol/l BRL37344 alone) to 4.0+/-1.3% (100 nmol/l BRL37344+1 micromol/l bupranolol). BRL37344 (100 micromol/) did not alter current amplitudes of KvLQT1/minK expressed in CHO cells or in Xenopus oocytes, excluding a direct effect of BRL37344 on the channel. 1 micromol/l BRL37344 mildly prolonged action potentials in guinea pig ventricle (APD(90):+7.8%)\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe have demonstrated a functional coupling between the beta(3)-adrenoceptor and ion channel function in the mammalian heart. Our findings point to a potential role for beta(3)-adrenoceptors in cardiac electrophysiology and pathophysiology.",

Four baboons, Papio cynocephalus, were chronically instrumented with electromagnetic flow detectors on the ascending aorta and common carotid artery. Cardiac output, peak aortic flow velocity and peak aortic flow acceleration are all depressed by Ketamine, 5 mg/kg i.m. Peak aortic flow acceleration and peak carotid flow acceleration were equally depressed. Thus, peak carotid flow acceleration is a useful indirect index of the left ventricular response to Ketamine in the baboon.",

        "title": "Growth hormone-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor as an essential element leading to MAP kinase activation and gene expression.",
        "abstract": "GH binding to its receptor, which belongs to the cytokine receptor superfamily, activates Janus kinase (JAK) 2 tyrosine kinase, thereby activating a number of intracellular key proteins such as STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) proteins and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, which finally lead to GH's biological actions including gene expression. In contrast to receptor tyrosine kinases, the signalling pathways leading to MAP kinase activation by GH are poorly understood but appear to involve Grb2 and Shc. We now show that GH stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its association with Grb2, and concomitantly stimulated MAP kinase activity in liver, a major target tissue. Expression of EGFR and its mutants into CHO-GH receptor (GHR) cells revealed that GH-induced full activation of MAP kinase and c-fos expression required tyrosine phosphorylation sites of EGFR but not its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Moreover, by also using dominant negative JAK2 and in vitro kinase assay, we demonstrated that tyrosine 1068 of EGFR was evidently one of the major phosphorylation and Grb2 binding sites stimulated by GH via JAK2. These data suggest that the role of EGFR in GH signalling is to be phosphorylated by JAK2, thereby providing docking sites for Grb2 and activating MAP kinases and gene expression. This novel cross talk pathway may provide the first example of the hormone and cytokine receptor superfamily transducing signals via associated nonreceptor tyrosine kinase by phosphorylating growth factor receptor and utilizing it as a docking protein independent of its receptor tyrosine kinase activity.",

        "abstract": "This manuscript describes the first detailed chemical investigation of endemic species Iris adriatica, including isolation and structure elucidation. Chemical analyses of the rhizome CH2Cl2/MeOH (2:1) extract revealed fourteen secondary metabolites, mainly isoflavonoids. Among isoflavonoids, two groups have been found: nigricin-type and tectorigenin-type. Dominant group of the isolated compounds has been nigricin-type isoflavones: nigricin, nigricin-4'-(1-O-β-D-glucopyranoside) and nigricin-4'-(1-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl (1-6)-β-D-glucopyranoside) with 2.5, 10 and 1% of the total extract, respectively. Irisxanthone - xanthone C-glucoside, β-sitosterol, benzophenone and one of its derivatives have also been found. Nigricin-type isoflavonoids and irisxanthone can be considered as possible chemotaxonomic markers for I. adriatica. 5,3',5'-Trimethoxy-6,7-methylenedioxyisoflavone-4'-(1-O-β-D-glucopyranoside) and benzophenone have been isolated from Iris species for the first time.",

        "abstract": "RATIONALE\nMutations in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-3 (VEGFR3 or FLT4) cause Milroy disease, an autosomal dominant condition that presents with congenital lymphedema. Mutations in VEGFR3 are identified in only 70% of patients with classic Milroy disease, suggesting genetic heterogeneity.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo investigate the underlying cause in patients with clinical signs resembling Milroy disease in whom sequencing of the coding region of VEGFR3 did not reveal any pathogenic variation.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nExome sequencing of 5 such patients was performed, and a novel frameshift variant, c.571_572insTT in VEGFC, a ligand for VEGFR3, was identified in 1 proband. The variant cosegregated with the affected status in the family. An assay to assess the biological function of VEGFC activity in vivo, by expressing human VEGFC in the zebrafish floorplate was established. Forced expression of wild-type human VEGFC in the floorplate of zebrafish embryos leads to excessive sprouting in neighboring vessels. However, when overexpressing the human c.571_572insTT variant in the floorplate, no sprouting of vessels was observed, indicating that the base changes have a marked effect on the activity of VEGFC.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe propose that the mutation in VEGFC is causative for the Milroy disease-like phenotype seen in this family. This is the first time a mutation in one of the ligands of VEGFR3 has been reported to cause primary lymphedema.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMost young children in the United States attend early care and education (ECE) programmes, where they consume the majority of daily calories. Best practices to support children's healthy eating include teachers sitting together with children, eating the same food, and appropriately supporting children in serving and feeding themselves. To understand how the COVID-19 pandemic changed mealtime practices in ECE, this study (1) describes what adaptations ECE directors and teachers made to mealtimes to include best practices, and (2) identifies common adaptations made to comply with COVID-19 infection control guidelines.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis cross-sectional, mixed-methods study utilized survey and interview questions based on the trust model and social cognitive theory. More than 7000 surveys were distributed to ECE directors and teachers in Florida. Surveys were completed by 759 directors and 431 teachers. Also, 29 follow-up interviews with teachers were completed. Participants were asked to describe their mealtimes before and during COVID-19. Descriptive statistics and frequencies were used to analyse survey data, and thematic analysis was applied to interview data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLess than 5% of survey respondents reported children serving themselves, a pre-COVID best practice. Interviews identified three common adaptations: (1) modification-best practices were incorporated into new routines, such as eating together but sitting farther away, (2) elimination-routines changed so that best practices were no longer possible, such as teachers wearing masks and standing during meals, and (3) minimal change-minimal changes due to COVID-19 occurred and consequently mealtime practices did not change.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCurrent recommendations do not allow children to self-serve, which previously was a key best practice. ECE centres that have successfully integrated COVID-19 modifications and maintained mealtime best practices-perhaps in a new form-can serve as examples for others. These findings are generalizable to ECE centres in Florida and could be compared with other states.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nNatural space is associated with reduced risk of, and narrower socioeconomic inequalities in, diseases that affect older populations, and some contributors to premature mortality in younger individuals. Burden of disease measures such as years of life lost (YLL) are influenced by premature poor health and death. We hypothesised some association between natural space and both rates of and inequalities in YLL might be present.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe outcome data were the YLL component from Scottish Burden of Disease 2016, provided at small-area level (datazone) for males and females under 65 years of age in Scotland, UK. Exposure variables were the percentages of land cover within each datazone defined as 'natural space' (NS), and 'natural space and private gardens' (NSG). Together with a measure of area income deprivation, these were fitted in a multilevel Poisson model accounting for intra-datazone level variation, and spatial autocorrelation between datazones.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAn increased percentage cover of NSG was associated with lower YLL in males (incident rate ratio (IRR) 0.993, 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.989 to 0.997) and females (IRR 0.993, CrI 0.987 to 0.998); each 10% increase of natural space cover was associated with a 7% decrease in the incidence rate. An increased amount of natural space within local areas was associated with reduced disparity in YLL between the most and least income deprived areas.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe health benefits of natural space also apply when indicators sensitive to health events at younger ages are used. An increased amount of natural space within local areas has the potential to reduce the disparity in YLL between the most and least income deprived areas-the 'equigenic' effect.",

China promotes telemedicine with great efforts, and its practices in the deployment of telemedicine platforms and delivery of services have become important references for the research and development in this field.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nOur work described in this paper focuses on a regional telemedicine platform that was built in 2014. We analyzed the system design scheme and remote consultations that were conducted via the system to understand the deployment and service delivery processes of a representative telemedicine platform in China.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe collected information on remote consultations conducted from 2015 to 2020 via the regional telemedicine platform that employs a centralized architectural system model. We used graphs and statistical methods to describe the changing trends of service volume of remote consultation, geographical and demographic distribution of patients, and waiting time and duration of consultations. The factors that affect consultation duration and patient referral were analyzed by multivariable linear regression models and binary logistic regression models, respectively. The attitudes toward telemedicine of 225 medical practitioners and 225 patients were collected using the snowball sampling method.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe regional telemedicine platform covers all levels of medical institutions and hospitals in all 18 cities of Henan Province as well as some interprovince hospitals. From 2015 to 2020, 103,957 remote medical consultations were conducted via the platform with an annual increasing rate of 0.64%. A total of 86.64% (90,069/103,957) of medical institutions (as clients) that applied for remote consultations were tier 1 or 2 and from less-developed regions; 65.65% (68,243/103,945) of patients who applied for remote consultations were aged over 50 years. The numbers of consultations were high for departments focusing in the treatment of chronic diseases such as neurology, respiratory medicine, and oncology. The invited experts were mainly experienced doctors with senior professional titles. Year of consultation, tier of hospital, consultation department, and necessity of patient referral were the main factors affecting the duration of consultations. In surveys, we found that 60.4% (136/225) of medical practitioners and 53.8% (121/225) of patients had high satisfaction and believed that telemedicine is of vital importance for the treatment of illness.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe development of telemedicine in China shows a growing trend and provides great benefits especially to medical institutions located in less developed regions and senior citizens who have less mobility. Cases of remote consultations are mainly for chronic diseases. At present, the importance and necessity of telemedicine are well recognized by both patients and medical practitioners. However, the waiting time needs to be further reduced to improve the efficiency of remote medical services.",

        "abstract": "Are surfaces' colours judged from weighted averages of the light that they reflect to the eyes and the colour contrast at their borders? To find out we asked subjects to set the colour and luminance of test disks to match reference disks, on various backgrounds, and analysed the variability in their settings. Most of the variability between repeated settings was in luminance. The standard deviations in the set colour were smallest when the disk and background were the same colour, irrespective of the colour itself. Matches were equally precise for greenish or reddish disks on a grey background, as for grey disks on a greenish or reddish background. The precision was less dependent on the colour contrast at the disks' borders when the backgrounds were more complex and when there was a large luminance contrast at the disks' borders. Subjects were less precise when different colours surrounded the two disks. These findings are consistent with the perceived colour at any position being a weighted average of the local cone excitation ratio and the change in the cone excitation ratio at the borders of the surface in question. However, the involved weights must be variable and depend systematically on parameters such as the luminance contrast at the surface's borders and other chromatic contrasts within the scene.",

This study bases on a dataset of 32 basidiocarps of the ectomycorrhizal Lactarius pubescens sampled in a former U mining area. Statistical analyses were combined with rare earth element (REE, La-Lu) patterns to study the element distribution within sporocarp compartments and between three different age classes. For this purpose, fruiting bodies were separated into stipe, pileus trama, pileipelles and lamellae, dried and digested with HNO3. While macronutrient (e.g. K, Mg, P, S) contents resemble those of a non-mining affected site, several elements (e.g. Co, Mn) were site-specifically taken up relative to elevated soil contents. With statistics, two main element distribution groups for L. pubescens were revealed: mainly essential (Cu, Mg, Mn, P, S, Zn, Cd, Co, Ni) and mainly non-essential elements (Al, Ca, Fe, Sr, U, REE). The highest REE contents were found in pileipelles and lamellae, corresponding to relatively small cell sizes. Stipes and pileus trama had low REE contents due to their function as transport systems. During growth, light REE (La-Nd) were strongly enriched in lamellae and pileipelles. Middle REE (Sm-Dy) enrichment was found both in soil and fungal biomass. Contents of nutrients decrease with age, while non-essential elements are enriched especially in pileipelles and lamellae. A weak positive Ce anomaly appeared in the bioavailable soil fraction and in the pileipelles of younger individuals. Substrate dependent uptake thus gets reduced with sporocarp senescence, possibly due to redistribution.",

        "abstract": "Maintaining ecological integrity necessitates a proactive approach of identifying and acquiring lands to conserve unfragmented landscapes, as well as evaluating existing mitigation strategies to increase connectivity in fragmented landscapes. The increased use of highway underpasses and overpasses to restore connectivity for wildlife species offers clear conservation benefits, yet also presents a unique opportunity to understand how weather conditions may impact movement of wildlife species. We used remote camera observations (19,480) from an existing wildlife highway underpass in Wyoming and daily meteorological observations to quantify weather conditions associated with autumn migration of mule deer in 2009 and 2010. We identified minimal daily temperature and snow depth as proximate cues associated with mule deer migration to winter range. These weather cues were consistent across does and bucks, but differed slightly by year. Additionally, extreme early season snow depth or cold temperature events appear to be associated with onset of migration. This information will assist wildlife managers and transportation officials as they plan future projects to maintain and enhance migration routes for mule deer.",

        "abstract": "STUDY DESIGN\nCase report and a review of the literature.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWe report the case of a young man with a short course of progressive cervical myelopathy (CM). Cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a stenosis of the cervical spinal canal at C4-C6 and an atypically enlarged intramedullary high intensity extending from C1-T1 (T2-weighted) with contrast enhancement at C4-C5 (T1-weighted). Neurologic and radiologic diagnosis therefore favored a tumor of the spinal cord.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA\nCM is a clinical diagnosis of mostly degenerative origin in older patients that features circumscribed high-intensity signals near the point of compression in T2-weighted MRI. Contrast enhancement in those high-intense areas is rarely described in the literature, and the differentiation from neoplastic and infective lesions might be very difficult in these cases.\n\n\nMETHODS\nRetrospective case study with follow-up examination and MRI-control 3 months after surgery.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe patient was decompressed and stabilized from dorsally, and a biopsy was taken. The exact diagnosis of a myelopathy and an exclusion of a neoplastic origin succeeded through histopathological examination. Three months after first surgery, the patient had improved significantly and underwent an additional anterior stabilization, while the MRI remained almost unchanged.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn case of a fast progressive CM with atypical radiographic appearance initial decompression with inspection of the spinal cord and a short-term clinical follow-up with an MRI control might be the procedure of choice, if a clear diagnosis for a causative treatment cannot be made. In still suspicious cases, a biopsy could be considered to exclude a neoplastic or inflammatory process.",

Although it is well known that many proteins were created from combinations of domains, most of the existing implementations of phylogenetic profiles do not consider this fact. Here, we introduce an extension that considers the multidomain nature of proteins and test the method against the known interaction data sets. Whereas earlier implementations associated one entire sequence with one protein phylogenetic profile (Single-Profile), our method instead breaks the sequence into a set of segments of predetermined size and constructs a separate profile for each segment (Multiple-Profile). The results show that the Multiple-Profile method performs as well as the Single-Profile method. However, the two methods share, surprisingly, a small fraction of their predictions, indicating that the Multiple-Profile method can detect known interactions missed by the Single-Profile method. Thus, the Multiple-Profile method can be used with other methods to determine functional relationships on a genome scale with wider coverage.",

To address this gap in food assistance for school-aged children, the Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer for Children (SEBTC) Demonstrations provided summer food assistance in the form of electronic benefits transfer cards to households with school-aged children certified for free or reduced-price meals during the school year.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOver 2011-2013, the SEBTC demonstrations were evaluated by using a random assignment design. Households were randomly assigned a monthly $60-per-child benefit, a monthly $30-per-child benefit, or no benefit, depending on the study year. Key outcomes included children's food security and consumption of foods and food groups related to a healthful diet (diet quality). At baseline (in the spring) and again in the summer, the evaluation surveyed ∼52 000 households over the course of the 3 years of the impact study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSEBTC reduced the prevalence of very low food security among children by one-third. It also had positive impacts on 6 of the 8 child nutrition outcomes measured (amounts of fruits and vegetables; whole grains; dairy foods; and added sugars).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSEBTC is a promising model to improve food security and the dietary quality of low-income school-aged children in the summer months.",

        "abstract": "Physical activity (PA) can improve health and quality of life (QOL) of healthy people. However, the association between PA and QOL among people with physical disability (PWPD) is inconclusive. This study was conducted to determine the relationships between factors including intensity of PA, activitiy in daily living (ADL), stress, and self-esteem that influences self-reported QOL among PWPD. The relationships were further explored using the in-depth interview method to find out whether the intensity of PA, stress, and self-esteem are related to QOL perception in PWPD. One hundred sixty PWPD aged 18-48 years who studied at a vocational school were enrolled. A mixed method case study was conducted: cross-sectional survey and in-depth interview. Five questionnaires, including the Barthel Index, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), and Physical Activity Scale for Individuals with Physical Disabilities (PASIPD) were distributed. QOL was measured using the WHOQOL_BREF. Multiple linear regression was used to determine factors for QOL prediction. For in-depth interview, ten persons from each group (poor-to-fair and good QOL) volunteered to explore further about life satisfaction related to physical disability. One hundred forty-six (91%) subjects completed all questionnaires. One hundred fourteen (77%) reported poor-to-fair QOL. QOL was explained by self-esteem and ADL (adjusted R² 34.7%, p < 0.001) after adjusted for age, stress, and PA. Although PA could not explain QOL in PWPD, good QOL reported high activities (28.40 ± 30.20 MET hour/day) compared to poor and fair QOL (17.94 ± 22.06 and 21.70 ± 17.75 MET hour/day). Those who had good QOL reported that they were proud to be independent and did not feel inferior. PA participation among people with disabilities should therefore be encouraged.",

        "abstract": "Acute exposure to triethyl lead chloride (7.88 mg/kg) enhanced the behavioral effects of both direct- and indirect-acting dopaminergic agonists. Rats treated with lead 1 week before testing exhibited an increased response to the motor stimulant effects of D-amphetamine and apomorphine. The dose-response curves for D-amphetamine (1.25, 2.0, 3.15 and 5.0 mg/kg)- and apomorphine (0.2, 0.5, 1.25 and 2.0 mg/kg)-induced hyperactivity were shifted to the left in the triethyl lead group. Finally, apomorphine (1 mg/kg) produced more stereotypy in rats pretreated with triethyl lead. This enhanced sensitivity to dopaminergic agonists was not due to altered pharmacokinetics of the challenge drugs, since the onset and duration of their behavioral effects were not affected by triethyl lead. Furthermore, the regional distribution and accumulation of D-[3H]amphetamine was not altered by triethyl lead. These data suggest that acute exposure to triethyl lead enhances the responsiveness of dopaminergic processes which contribute to locomotor activity. The involvement of brain dopamine in other aspects of organolead neurotoxicity is discussed.",

Recently, it has been shown that this principle may be more complex than originally anticipated.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA quantitative, cross-sectional survey design was used. The quality of social exchange and identification was scored by the involved registered nurses and nurse assistants; in-role and extra-role behaviour was rated by the head nurse.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe survey was administered to nurses and nurse assistants (n = 196) working in five Belgian nursing homes. Data were collected from February-March 2012. Pearson correlation analyses, t-test analyses and hierarchical regression were used to analyse the data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur results showed no relationship between perceived organizational support and leader-member exchange and in-role behaviour. A positive relationship was found between perceived organizational support and extra-role behaviour and a trend towards significance between leader-member exchange and extra-role behaviour. Organizational and professional identification moderated the relationship between perceived organizational support and extra-role behaviour.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study demonstrates the importance of social exchange to nurses and nurse assistants and therefore nursing administrators and leaders. When registered nurses and nurse assistants perceive high-quality social exchange, they are more likely to go the extra mile on behalf of the organization. Fostering social identification could enhance this.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPatients with schizophrenia display impaired cognitive functioning and increased sensitivity to psychomimetic drugs. The neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia posits that disruption of the developing brain predisposes neural networks to lasting structural and functional abnormalities resulting in the emergence of such symptoms in adulthood. Given the critical role of the glutamatergic system in early brain development, we investigated whether chronic prenatal exposure to the glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, induces schizophrenia-like behavioural and neurochemical changes in juvenile and adult rats.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPregnant Long-Evans rats were administered saline or MK-801 (0.1mg/kg; s.c.) at gestation day 7-19. Object recognition memory and cognitive flexibility were assessed in the male offspring using a novel object preference task and a maze-based set-shifting procedure, respectively. Locomotor-activating effects of acute amphetamine and MK-801 were also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAdult, but not juvenile, prenatally MK-801-treated rats failed to show novel object preference after a 90min delay, suggesting that object recognition memory may have been impaired. In addition, the set-shifting task revealed impaired acquisition of a new rule in adult prenatally MK-801-treated rats compared to controls. This deficit appeared to be driven by regression to the previously learned behaviour. There were no significant differences in drug-induced locomotor activity in juvenile offspring or in adult offspring following acute amphetamine challenges. Unexpectedly, MK-801-induced locomotor activity in adult prenatally MK-801-treated rats was lower compared to controls.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGlutamate transmission dysfunction during early development may modify behavioural parameters in adulthood, though these parameters do not appear to model deficits observed in schizophrenia.",

        "title": "[Modified biological behaviour of 99mTc-pertechnetate in man as a result of a preceeding administration of tin (tin effect) (author's transl)].",
        "abstract": "An increased image of blood-filled spaces (Plexus choriodeus, Sinus transversus) was observed in 99mTc-pertechnetate scintigraphy when it had been preceded by the administration of tin (e.g. of 99mTc-Sn-diphosphonate). We have called this behaviour the \"tin effect\". In vitro studies demonstrated binding of about 80% of the administered activity in the blood with a biological half-life of about 44 hr and an effective half-life of about 5.3 hr. 95% of the blood activity was bound to red cells and 5% to plasma. This resulted in an increased radiation dose to the bone marrow of about 530 mrad/mCi 99mTc-pertechnetate (following tin). The extent of the tin effect decreased with the length of the interval between tin and 99mTc-pertechnetate administration. Because of the tin effect 99mTc-DTPA or 99mTc-citrate should be used for brain scintigraphy if this has to be performed within the first 5 or 7 days following a bone scintigraphy with a tin-containing radiopharmaceutical. The \"tin effect\" might be taken advantages of when labelling red cells and imaging vascular spaces.",

        "abstract": "The inflammasome has an essential function in innate immune, responding to a wide variety of stimuli. Here we show that the lncRNA Neat1 promotes the activation of several inflammasomes. Neat1 associates with the NLRP3, NLRC4, and AIM2 inflammasomes in mouse macrophages to enhance their assembly and subsequent pro-caspase-1 processing. Neat1 also stabilizes the mature caspase-1 to promote interleukin-1β production and pyroptosis. Upon stimulation with inflammasome-activating signals, Neat1, which normally resides in the paraspeckles, disassociates from these nuclear bodies and translocates to the cytoplasm to modulate inflammasome activation using above mechanism. Neat1 is also up-regulated under hypoxic conditions in a HIF-2α-dependent manner, mediating the effect of hypoxia on inflammasomes. Moreover, in the mouse models of peritonitis and pneumonia, Neat1 deficiency significantly reduces inflammatory responses. These results reveal a previously unrecognized role of lncRNAs in innate immunity, and suggest that Neat1 is a common mediator for inflammasome stimuli.",

        "abstract": "A new method is described for the esterification of carboxyl groups in proteins by reaction of the lyophilized protein in vacuo with gaseous alcohol and HCI catalyst. Carboxyl groups are rapidly esterified with no protein degradation. 13C-Methyl or 13C-ethyl esters of the alpha-, gamma- and delta-carboxyl groups could be distinguished by the distinct chemical shifts of their resonances. Within the class of gamma- or delta-esters, the chemical shifts have little variation; however, the chemical shift of a C-terminal esterified alpha-carboxyl group shows a strong dependence on the nature of the C-terminal amino acid and sequence. Iodomethane reacts with deprotonated carboxyl groups in lyophilized proteins to form methyl esters, but unlike the reaction with gaseous methanol/HCI, it does not selectively methylate carboxyl groups. The procedure permits the cost-effective incorporation of isotopic labels and provides a new approach using 13C-NMR spectroscopy for determining the number of different C-termini present in a protein preparation.",

It constitutes a pejorative factor with an increased risk of permanent colostomy and proctectomy and is associated with a major deterioration in quality of life. Secondary anal lesions in Crohn's disease are fistulas and abscesses. They are difficult to treat and often recurrent. A multidisciplinary medico-surgical management in several stages is essential. The classic sequence is based on a first phase of drainage of fistulas and abscesses, a second phase of medical treatment based primarily on anti-TNF alpha and finally a third phase of surgical closure of the fistula tract(s). Conventional closure techniques such as biologic glue, plug, advancement flap and intersphincteric ligation of the fistula tract have limited effectiveness, are not always feasible, require technical skills and some have an impact on anal continence. In recent years, we have witnessed a real enthusiasm generated by the arrival of cell therapy. This has not spared proctology since adipose-derived allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have had Marketing Authorisation and have been reimbursed in France since 2020 in the treatment of complex anal fistulas in Crohn's disease after failure of at least one biologic therapy. This new treatment offers an additional alternative in patients often in a situation of therapeutic impasse. Preliminary results in real life are satisfactory with a good safety profile. However, it will be necessary to confirm these results in the longer term and to work to determine the profile of the patients who could benefit the most from this expensive therapy.",

        "abstract": "Conventional wisdom suggests that for small data sets having substantial skew, one should attempt to determine the correct distributional form, if possible, and apply statistical methods appropriate for that distribution. Transformations such as the log or square root are often used. If an appropriate distributional form cannot be determined, a distribution-free procedure such as a rank transformation or a randomization test procedure can be used. To better appreciate the effect of such alternatives on both the type I error and power of detecting differences between treatment groups, simulation studies were conducted for responses having specific gamma G(r, theta) and log-normal ln(M, V) distributions. The gamma and log-normal distributions were selected so that they had the same first two moments. A simple two group design was assumed. The reference group always had an average disease level mu = 3.0 (mu = r theta for gamma, mu = M for log-normal), and the treatment group always had means whose reductions ranged from 0 per cent to 50 per cent. The effect of distributional type and the degree of skewness was investigated by varying the population parameter values. Six statistical test procedures were compared for the gamma distributions. All test procedures were robust relative to the type I error. The UMP test based on a ratio of sample means produced the greatest power for all combinations of n, r and RT. The power losses associated with the randomization test, the t-test on original scale, and the t-test on the square root scale were very small, (3 per cent to 6 per cent in absolute value) for n = 10 and 15, and less than 2 per cent for group sizes of 25 or more. The power loss associated with the t-test on the log scale was much larger, ranging from 5 per cent to 10 per cent smaller power than the t-test on original scale. The Wilcoxon rank test produced similar results to that of the LOG t-test for small samples. The power for the shifted LOG (X+c) test increased monotonically to the asymptotic value of the ORIG t-test. The same five test procedures based on differences in sample means were then compared for the corresponding log-normal distributions. The UMP test, that is, LOG(X), produced the highest power. There was very little power lost for the SQRT t-test. The loss in power varied between 2 per cent and 5 per cent for the RANK test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The autoimmune disease might be involved in its aetiology, but this remains to be confirmed. Recently epidemiological studies of AIH in Asia have been broadly conducted, revealing characteristics and management of AIH patients in Asia. In East Asia, most AIH patients are type 1, and type 2 AIH is very rare. However, type 2 AIH in South Asia is as frequent as in Europe and the USA. HLA-DR4 is associated with the characteristics of type 1 AIH in East Asia, whereas HLA-DR3 occurs in AIH patients from South Asia. AIH prevalence worldwide is increasing, and several studies have reported a prevalence of 19.44, 22.80 and 12.99 per 100 000 people in Europe, the USA and Asia respectively. A meta-analysis of studies on AIH showed similar annual incidence rates for all regions, with 1.31, 1.37 and 1.00 per 100 000 people in Asia, Europe and the USA respectively. The increase in the rates could be attributable to the increased awareness of disease concepts and diagnosis. In South Asia, most cases were diagnosed as AIH only after having progressed to cirrhosis, which may cause a higher mortality rate in South Asia than in East Asia. Therefore, the early diagnosis and treatment of AIH patients can improve the current situation in Asia.",

The use of optogenetics on the outer cell surface to interrogate how cells receive stimuli from their environment, however, has so far not reached its full potential. Here we demonstrate the development of an optogenetically regulated membrane receptor-ligand pair exemplified by the optically responsive interaction of an integrin receptor with the extracellular matrix. The system is based on an integrin engineered with a phytochrome-interacting factor domain (OptoIntegrin) and a red light-switchable phytochrome B-functionalized matrix (OptoMatrix). This optogenetic receptor-ligand pair enables light-inducible and -reversible cell-matrix interaction, as well as the controlled activation of downstream mechanosensory signalling pathways. Pioneering the application of optogenetic switches in the extracellular environment of cells, this OptoMatrix-OptoIntegrin system may serve as a blueprint for rendering matrix-receptor interactions amendable to precise control with light.",

However, the commercial utilisation of Bt crops greatly highlights biosafety issues worldwide. Therefore, assessing the risks caused by genetically modified crops prior to their commercial cultivation is a critical issue to be addressed. In agricultural biotechnology, the goal of safety assessment is not just to identify the safety of a genetically modified (GM) plant, rather to demonstrate its impact on the ecosystem. Various experimental studies have been made worldwide during the last 20 years to investigate the risks and fears associated with non-target organisms (NTOs). The NTOs include beneficial insects, natural pest controllers, rhizobacteria, growth promoting microbes, pollinators, soil dwellers, aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates, mammals and humans. To highlight all the possible risks associated with different GM events, information has been gathered from a total of 76 articles, regarding non-target plant and soil inhabiting organisms, and summarised in the form of the current review article. No significant harmful impact has been reported in any case study related to approved GM events, although critical risk assessments are still needed before commercialisation of these crops. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.",

S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) inhibitor can regulate the synthesis and release of NO in vivo and has a protective effect on CIRI. Therefore, early administration of GSNOR to CA-CPR patients could be the main treatment method to improve the prognosis of those patients. A large number of studies have been done to improve the prognosis of CA-CPR in recent years. In order to provide reference for further research on the treatment and brain protection of CIRI after CA-CPR, the article reviewed the main mechanisms of brain injury after CA-CPR, the protective effect and mechanism of NO on cerebral I/R injury, the production and regulation of NO, in vivo, and the protective effect of GSNOR inhibitors on CIRI, especially the research progress of GSNOR inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "We conducted a survey to determine how two professional sectors in Belgium, horticulture professionals and nature reserve managers (those directly involved in conservation), view the issues associated with invasive plant species. We developed and utilized a questionnaire that addressed the themes of awareness, concept and use of language, availability of information, impacts and, finally, control and available solutions. Using co-inertia analyses, we tested to what extent the perception of invasive alien species (IAS) was dependent upon the perception of Nature in general. Only forty-two percent of respondent horticulture professionals and eighty-two percent of nature reserve managers had a general knowledge of IAS. Many individuals in both target groups nonetheless had an accurate understanding of the scientific issues. Our results therefore suggest that the manner in which individuals within the two groups view, or perceive, the IAS issue was more the result of lack of information than simply biased perceptions of target groups. Though IAS perceptions by the two groups diverged, they were on par with how they viewed Nature in general. The descriptions of IAS by participants converged with the ideas and concepts frequently found in the scientific literature. Both managers and horticulture professionals expressed a strong willingness to participate in programs designed to prevent the spread of, and damage caused by, IAS. Despite this, the continued commercial availability of many invasive species highlighted the necessity to use both mandatory and voluntary approaches to reduce their re-introduction and spread. The results of this study provide stakeholders and conservation managers with practical information on which communication and management strategies can be based.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIn 2014, a composite pack containing mifepristone-buccal misoprostol, indicated for use to 63 days gestation replaced the existing regimen for early medical abortion (EMA) in Australia.\n\n\nAIMS\nTo provide updated efficacy and safety information for the use of mifepristone-buccal misoprostol for EMA in Australia, and assess the effect of patient age and gestational age on efficacy.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nObservational cohort study of 15 008 women attending one of 16 Marie Stopes International clinics in Australia for an EMA (gestational age ≤ 63 days) between 1 March 2013 and 30 September 2015. Administration of 200 mg oral mifepristone in-clinic was followed 24-48 h later by 800 μg buccal misoprostol self-administered at home. Method success was defined as complete abortion not requiring surgical intervention.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFollow-up information was available for 87.14% (13 078/15 008) of women. Likelihood of follow-up was significantly lower for women from rural or remote locations (adjusted odds ratio, 0.47; P < 0.001). Medical abortion was successful in 95.16% (12 445/13 078) of women with follow-up. Higher patient and gestational ages were associated (P < 0.001) with a slight increase in method failure. There were 674 serious adverse events (5.15%), mainly due to method failure. Infection (15; 0.11%) and haemorrhage (17; 0.13%) were rare. One death was recorded (<0.01%); however, an association between EMA and cause of death, necrotising pneumonia, was not established.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMifepristone-buccal misoprostol is an effective and safe alternative to surgical termination of pregnancy up to 63 days gestation.",

        "abstract": "Denosumab is an anti-bone resorptive drug consisting of complete human monoclonal antibodies that targets receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL), which is responsible for osteoclast formation. The drug has been adapted for bone diseases, such as osteoporosis and bone metastasis related to cancer, but is not used for alveolar bone destruction related to periodontitis. In the present study, we aimed to clarify whether denosumab prevents bone destruction associated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced calvaria inflammation and experimental periodontitis in model mice. Denosumab does not bind to mouse RANKL, thus we used anti-mouse monoclonal RANKL antibodies. We also examined the inhibitory effects toward bone destruction of another anti-bone resorptive drug zoledronate, a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate. Local administration of anti- RANKL antibodies into the calvaria area inhibited LPS-induced osteoclast formation and bone destruction, while zoledronate inhibited bone destruction but not osteoclast formation due to its different action mechanism. In periodontitis model mice, in which the second molars were ligated with a silk suture to induce inflammation, intraperitoneal administration of anti-RANKL antibodies significantly inhibited alveolar bone destruction and tooth root exposure. On the other hand, zoledronate only weakly repressed alveolar bone destruction and failed to inhibit root exposure. These results suggest that denosumab is a promising candidate to prevent alveolar bone destruction associated with periodontitis.",

Thus, many system- and algorithm-wise challenges remain to be addressed to have operational, battery-powered wireless smart-camera networks. We present a wireless embedded smart-camera system for cooperative object tracking and detection of composite events spanning multiple camera views. Each camera is a CITRIC mote consisting of a camera board and wireless mote. Lightweight and robust foreground detection and tracking algorithms are implemented on the camera boards. Cameras exchange small-sized data wirelessly in a peer-to-peer manner. Instead of transferring or saving every frame or trajectory, events of interest are detected. Simpler events are combined in a time sequence to define semantically higher-level events. Event complexity can be increased by increasing the number of primitives and/or number of camera views they span. Examples of consistently tracking objects across different cameras, updating location of occluded/lost objects from other cameras, and detecting composite events spanning two or three camera views, are presented. All the processing is performed on camera boards. Operating current plots of smart cameras, obtained when performing different tasks, are also presented. Power consumption is analyzed based upon these measurements.",

        "abstract": "Many microbial pathogens subvert proteoglycans for their adhesion to host tissues, invasion of host cells, infection of neighbouring cells, dissemination into the systemic circulation, and evasion of host defence mechanisms. Where studied, specific virulence factors mediate these proteoglycan-pathogen interactions, which are thus thought to affect the onset, progression and outcome of infection. Proteoglycans are composites of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains attached covalently to specific core proteins. Proteoglycans are expressed ubiquitously on the cell surface, in intracellular compartments, and in the extracellular matrix. GAGs mediate the majority of ligand-binding activities of proteoglycans, and many microbial pathogens elaborate cell-surface and secreted factors that interact with GAGs. Some pathogens also modulate the expression and function of proteoglycans through known virulence factors. Several GAG-binding pathogens can no longer attach to and invade host cells whose GAG expression has been reduced by mutagenesis or enzymatic treatment. Furthermore, GAG antagonists have been shown to inhibit microbial attachment and host cell entry in vitro and reduce virulence in vivo. Together, these observations underscore the biological significance of proteoglycan-pathogen interactions in infectious diseases.",

        "abstract": "The fans' importance in sports is acknowledged by the term 'the 12th man', a figurative extra player for the home team. Sport teams are indeed more successful when they play in front of their fans than when they play away. The supposed mechanism behind this phenomenon, termed Home Advantage (HA), is that fans' support spurs home players to better performance and biases referees, which in turn determines the outcome. The inference about the importance of fans' support is, however, indirect as there is normally a 12th man of this kind, even if it is an opponent's. The current pandemic, which forced sporting activities to take place behind closed doors, provides the necessary control condition. Here we employ a novel conceptual HA model on a sample of over 4000 soccer matches from 12 European leagues, some played in front of spectators and some in empty stadia, to demonstrate that fans are indeed responsible for the HA. However, the absence of fans reduces the HA by a third, as the home team's performance suffers and the officials' bias disappears. The current pandemic reveals that the figurative 12th man is no mere fan hyperbole, but is in fact the most important player in the home team.",

Despite extensive characterization, the molecular mechanism underlying the recognition and response to L-Trp by the TnaC-ribosome complex remains unknown. Here, we use a combined biochemical and structural approach to characterize a TnaC variant (R23F) with greatly enhanced sensitivity for L-Trp. We show that the TnaC-ribosome complex captures a single L-Trp molecule to undergo termination arrest and that nascent TnaC prevents the catalytic GGQ loop of release factor 2 from adopting an active conformation at the peptidyl transferase center. Importantly, the L-Trp binding site is not altered by the R23F mutation, suggesting that the relative rates of L-Trp binding and peptidyl-tRNA cleavage determine the tryptophan sensitivity of each variant. Thus, our study reveals a strategy whereby a nascent peptide assists the ribosome in detecting a small metabolite.",

        "abstract": "Photoacoustic (PA) imaging has emerged as a promising bio-imaging technique due to its non-invasive visualization of lesions at great penetration depths. Fluorescence (FL) imaging in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) achieves a higher imaging resolution and lower background signals compared to NIR-I. However, the single imaging method possesses its own disadvantages. Thus, we have demonstrated ZIF-8-IR820-MnPc-HA nanoparticles (ZIMH NPs) that can achieve visualization and localization of tumors in mice models with the help of a dual-modality PA/NIR-II FL imaging performance. Meanwhile, these excellent nanoparticles also induce the efficient generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) upon 808 nm laser illumination, and display excellent photodynamic therapy efficacy in cells, further indicating their potential application for in vivo PDT. In ZIMH NPs, hyaluronic acid (HA) impressively acts as a \"sponge\", enhancing the generation of 1O2 and facilitating the cellular therapeutic effects. We believe that ZIF-8-IR820-MnPc-HA NPs present a brand-new strategy for the exploration of efficient PDT photosensitizers with dual-modality imaging performance for use in various biomedical applications.",

Among the 73 suspected episodes VAP was confirmed by quantitative bronchoalveolar lavage cultures in 32 and refuted in 41. Respective median \"before\" procalcitonin levels were 1.89 ng/ml (interquartile range 0.18-6.01) and 2.14 (0.76-5.75) in patients with and without VAP, but their respective median day-1 procalcitonin levels did not differ: 1.07 ng/ml (0.39-6.57) vs. 1.40 (0.67-3.39). On day 1 a 0.5 ng/ml procalcitonin threshold had 72% sensitivity but only 24% specificity for diagnosing VAP. Between \"before\" and day 1, procalcitonin increased in 41% and 15% of patients with and without VAP, respectively. Thus a procalcitonin rise on day 1, compared to its \"before\" level, had 41% sensitivity and 85% specificity for diagnosing VAP, with respective positive and negative predictive values of 68% and 65%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCrude values and procalcitonin rise had poor diagnostic value for VAP in this particular setting and thus should not be used to initiate antibiotics when VAP is clinically suspected.",

        "abstract": "COVID-19 being a public health emergency of international concern has emerged in most African countries including Niger. Niger, a landlocked country, is tasked with controlling the pandemic. However, of the big challenges the country faced is the fragility of healthcare system which posed limitations to the fight against the virus. The virus overwhelmed the fragile healthcare system which led to inaccessibility of quality healthcare to the citizens coupled with issues of flooding and economic recession that happened during the pandemic. The healthcare sectored has further been crippled by exposure and infection of the already insufficient healthcare workers. In addition to this, there was the burden of NTDs and other communicable and non-communicable diseases that subverted the country in the depths of difficulties. As per the predictions of World Bank, the poverty curve is likely to escalate due to the outrageous impacts of COVID-19. Adding on to this, the occurrence of natural disasters such as flooding has further stretched the country. It's no coincidence that the country would confront plethora of challenges amidst the second wave. Therefore, timely decision and necessary interventions are needed to strengthen the country's fight against the pandemic. However, this is only feasible when Nigerien government, international allies and other wealthy nations work closely to ensure that the challenges faced by the healthcare system are tackled.",

        "abstract": "A single L-type pyruvate kinase (PK) gene seems to exist per haploid genome. It is expressed in the liver, kidney and small intestine in the form of three mRNA species of 2, 2.2 and 3.2 X 10(3) bases (kb). All three species are polyadenylated and translatable into the same L-type subunit. Primer extension experiments demonstrate that all three PK mRNAs have the same 5' ends. Nuclease S1 protection experiments with various cDNA and 3' genomic probes indicate that the different mRNA species only differ by the length of their 3' noncoding region. The mechanism responsible for the production of the three transcripts seems to be the use of alternative unusual polyadenylation sites. Run-on assays with specific probes recognizing only the 3.2-kb or all three mRNA species show that the transcription proceeds across the gene with similar rate. This means that the process involved in generation of the three transcripts is a posttranscriptional event, probably due to different sites of endonucleolytic cleavage of primary transcripts extending 3' from the gene region encoding the mature mRNAs. The ratio between the different PK mRNA species is, to a certain extent, tissue-specific and changes with development. The role of an 'identifier sequence' located in the 3' noncoding sequence of the 3.2-kb species in such a tissue-specific use of alternative polyadenylation sites is discussed.",

Malware events compromise system integrity and patient privacy which could lead to delays in treatment, loss of patient data, inability to provide care, and increase in patient harm. In addition, these attacks may also compromise private and personal information for those targeted.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nNurses represent a large portion of frontline healthcare workers and are uniquely positioned to help prevent cyber-attacks. Nursing curriculum should include education about the risks to patient safety from cybercrime and the nurse's role in preventing cybercrime.

        "abstract": "The int-2 gene, which encodes a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, was discovered as a protooncogene transcriptionally activated following proviral insertion into adjacent chromosomal DNA. Analyses of the synthesis and processing of the int-2 protein, using an SV40-based vector to express cloned cDNA, showed four major products in the size range 27.5-31.5 kd that were associated with the secretory pathway. Further experiments using a cell-free translation system programmed with int-2 cRNA revealed a larger N-terminally extended protein. Site-directed mutagenesis of possible initiation codons confirmed that the first in-frame AUG codon would specify the start of a protein that includes a signal peptide for transport into the endoplasmic reticulum. However, protein synthesis also initiates at an upstream CUG codon to yield a polypeptide extended at the N-terminus by 29 amino acids. Immunofluorescent staining showed that a substantial proportion of the CUG-initiated protein resides in the cell nucleus, while a truncated int-2, lacking both the N-terminal extension and the signal peptide, was exclusively nuclear. These observations suggest that a nuclear localisation signal occurs in the body of the int-2 molecule, but is only accessible to the nuclear transport system if entry to the secretory pathway is compromised. Thus, the choice of initiation codon changes the subcellular fate of the int-2 protein and provides the potential for a duality of function through alternative transport pathways.",

        "abstract": "The process of cell division in mammalian cells is orchestrated by cell-cycle-dependent oscillations of cyclin protein levels. Cyclin levels are controlled by redundant transcriptional, post-translational and degradation feedback loops. How each of these separate loops contributes to the regulation of the key cell cycle events and to the connection between the G1-S transition and the subsequent mitotic events is under investigation. Here, we present an integrated computational model of the mammalian cell cycle based on the sequential activation of cyclins. We validate the model against experimental data on liver cells (hepatocytes), which undergo one or two rounds of synchronous circadian-clock gated cell divisions during liver regeneration, after partial hepatectomy (PH). The model exhibits bandpass filter properties that allow the system to ignore strong but transient, or sustained but weak damages after PH. Bifurcation analysis of the model suggests two different threshold mechanisms for the progression of the cell through mitosis. These results are coherent with the notion that the mitotic exit in mammalian cells is bistable, and suggests that Cdc20 homologue 1 (Cdh1) is an important regulator of mitosis. Regulation by Cdh1 also explains the observed G2/M phase prolongation after hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulation during S phase.",

        "abstract": "Herpesvirus nucleocapsids assemble in the nucleus and must cross the nuclear membrane for final assembly and maturation to form infectious progeny virions in the cytoplasm. It has been proposed that nucleocapsids enter the perinuclear space by budding through the inner nuclear membrane, and these enveloped nucleocapsids then fuse with the outer nuclear membrane to enter the cytoplasm. Little is known about the mechanism(s) for nuclear egress of herpesvirus nucleocapsids and, in particular, which, if any, cellular proteins are involved in the nuclear egress pathway. UL12 is an alkaline nuclease encoded by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and has been suggested to be involved in viral DNA maturation and nuclear egress of nucleocapsids. Using a live-cell imaging system to study cells infected by a recombinant HSV-1 expressing UL12 fused to a fluorescent protein, we observed the previously unreported nucleolar localization of UL12 in live infected cells and, using coimmunoprecipitation analyses, showed that UL12 formed a complex with nucleolin, a nucleolus marker, in infected cells. Knockdown of nucleolin in HSV-1-infected cells reduced capsid accumulation, as well as the amount of viral DNA resistant to staphylococcal nuclease in the cytoplasm, which represented encapsidated viral DNA, but had little effect on these viral components in the nucleus. These results indicated that nucleolin is a cellular factor required for efficient nuclear egress of HSV-1 nucleocapsids in infected cells.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nPrevious dosimetry protocols allowed calibrations of proton beamline dose monitors to be performed in plastic phantoms. Nevertheless, dose determinations were referenced to absorbed dose-to-muscle or absorbed dose-to-water. The IAEA Code of Practice TRS 398 recommended that dose calibrations be performed with ionization chambers only in water phantoms because plastic-to-water dose conversion factors were not available with sufficient accuracy at the time of its writing. These factors are necessary, however, to evaluate the difference in doses delivered to patients if switching from calibration in plastic to a protocol that only allows calibration in water.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis work measured polystyrene-to-water dose conversion factors for this purpose. Uncertainties in the results due to temperature, geometry, and chamber effects were minimized by using special experimental set-up procedures. The measurements were validated by Monte Carlo simulations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt the peak of non-range-modulated beams, measured polystyrene-to-water factors ranged from 1.015 to 1.024 for beams with ranges from 36 to 315 mm. For beams with the same ranges and medium sized modulations, the factors ranged from 1.005 to 1.019. The measured results were used to generate tables of polystyrene-to-water dose conversion factors.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe dose conversion factors can be used at clinical proton facilities to support beamline and patient specific dose per monitor unit calibrations performed in polystyrene phantoms.",

We estimated historical PFOA serum levels via a job-exposure matrix based on over 2000 serum measurements. Non-occupational exposure from drinking water was also estimated. Lifetime serum cumulative dose (combining occupational and non-occupational exposure) was our exposure metric. We studied 17 disease outcomes with more than 20 validated cases.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe median measured serum level was 113 ng/mL in 2005 (n=1881), compared with 4 ng/mL in the US. Ulcerative colitis (10-year lag) showed a significant trend (p≤0.05) with increasing dose (quartile rate ratios (RRs)=1.00, 3.00, 3.26, 6.57, n=28, p for trend=0.05), similar to earlier findings in the community study. Rheumatoid arthritis (no lag) showed a positive trend in a categorical trend test (RRs=1.00, 2.11, 4.08, 4.45, n=23, p for trend=0.04). Positive non-significant trends were also observed for prostate cancer, non-hepatitis liver disease and male hypothyroidism, which have been implicated in other studies. A significant negative trend was found for bladder cancer and asthma with medication. No marked trends were seen for high cholesterol, which had been seen in the community study.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUlcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis were positively linked to PFOA exposure among workers. Data were limited by small numbers, under-representation of hard-to-trace decedents and few low-exposed referents.",

        "abstract": "The object of this study was to look at, on the one hand, the demands made on the pregnant woman's heart and, on the other hand, the effects on fetal heart rate resulting from moderate exercise with a definite rhythm performed by pregnant women. Ten primiparous pregnant women who had normal pregnancies took part in this study in the third and eighth months of the pregnancies. These women were compared with 20 control women who were not pregnant but whose mean age, height and weight were similar to those in the study before their pregnancies started. The maternal heart rate was monitored continuously and the fetal heart rate was recorded telemetrically when the women were carrying 5 kg in each hand with the arms held upright. We will discuss the results that were obtained in the 5 women who followed the course from the beginning to the end of the pregnancy for the sake of this study. The mean heart rate at rest was considerably higher in the pregnant women than in the controls at rest and standing. The heart rate was much higher during the exercise in the pregnant women than in the controls at rest and standing. The heart rate was much higher during the exercise in the pregnant women than in the controls. These changes in heart rate were essentially the same between the 3rd and the 8th month of the pregnancy. The fetal heart rate did not change significantly during nor after the exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus has been implicated as a frequent cause of acute sporadic hepatitis among Egyptian children. Moreover, an extraordinarily high seroprevalence rate was previously reported in a semiurban Nile Delta population. A conspicuous feature of hepatitis E is the high morbidity and mortality it can cause among infected pregnant women. We therefore evaluated the prevalence of HEV antibodies in adolescent females using a solid-phase enzyme linked immunoassay based on two recombinant hepatitis E virus antigens. A high prevalence rate (38.9%) was found in 95 apparently healthy adolescent females. The mean age of the study subjects was 21.81 +/- 2.5 (SD) range 16-25 years. Eighty (84.2%) subjects resided in Alexandria, while 15 (15.8%) came from semiurban villages of Alexandria Governorate. An increased prevalence was noted with age, as anti-HEV antibodies were detected in 32.1% and 41.8% of study participants in the second and third decades of life, respectively. Similarly, those illiterate or having received less than primary education exhibited a higher HEV prevalence than those with higher education (46.3% vs 29.3%). The majority of subjects having serological evidence of HEV infection denied previous history of jaundice which shows that HEV infection was subclinical in those cases. Ten (55.6%) pregnant females participating in the study, as well as 48 (62.3%) non pregnant females lacked serological evidence of HEV infection; i.e., 60.01% (10 + 48 out of 95) of women in the childbearing age may be susceptible to infection. This report suggests that HEV is endemic in Alexandria, Egypt; the epidemiologic risk factors associated with HEV infection need further exploration.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nWe investigated whether childhood social isolation was associated with retinal neural layer changes in adulthood, and whether this association was independent of other childhood or adulthood risk factors, including adult social isolation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nParticipants were members of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, a longitudinal population-based birth cohort from Aotearoa New Zealand (n = 1037), born 1972-1973 and followed until age 45, with 94% of the living cohort still participating. Social isolation was recorded prospectively at ages 5, 7, 9, and 11, from teacher and parent report. Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) thicknesses were measured via optical coherence tomography (OCT) at age 45.\n\n\nRESULTS\nChildhood social isolation was associated with thinner average RNFL (B = -0.739, p = .02), nasal RNFL (B = -1.118, p = .005) and inferior RNFL (B = -1.524, p = .007), although only nasal RNFL remained significant after adjustment. These associations were not fully explained by other psychosocial or physical health risk factors in childhood or adulthood, nor were they mediated by adult loneliness or social support.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nChildhood social isolation was an independent predictor of RNFL thickness in middle age. Highlighting prospective links between childhood psychosocial adversity and retinal neuronal measures will help to inform future research into the utility of retinal neuronal thickness as a biomarker for neurodegeneration.",

The following study was conducted to investigate the effect of short-term repeated fasting (4 consecutive days, every 2 weeks) before wound creation on skin wound healing. Mice were used for macroscopic study (n = 40) and hydroxyproline analysis (n = 10). Mice were also used for microscopic study (n = 36) and were divided equally into a fasting group and a control group. The results revealed that there were significant differences in epithelialization, contraction, healing, amount of collagen, and hydroxyproline between the control and fasting groups (P < 0.05). Based on the results, it can be argued that caloric restriction preceding the wound-healing period has the potential to accelerate the healing process. ﻿.",

        "abstract": "Modeling and understanding protein-ligand interactions is one of the most important goals in computational drug discovery. To this end, proteochemometrics uses structural and chemical descriptors from several proteins and several ligands to induce interaction-models. Here, we present a new and generalized approach in which proteins varying greatly in terms of sequence and structure are represented by a library of local substructures. Using linear regression and rule-based learning, we combine such local substructures with chemical descriptors from the ligands to model binding affinity for a training set of hydrolase and lyase enzymes. We evaluate the predictive performance of these models using cross validation and sets of unseen ligand with unknown three-dimensional structure. The models are shown to generalize by outperforming models using descriptors from only proteins or only ligands, or models using global structure similarities rather than local similarities. Thus, we demonstrate that this approach is capable of describing dependencies between local structural properties and ligands in otherwise dissimilar protein structures. These dependencies are often, but not always, associated with local substructures that are in contact with the ligands. Finally, we show that strongly bound enzyme-ligand complexes require the presence of particular local substructures, while weakly bound complexes may be described by the absence of certain properties. The results demonstrate that the alignment-independent approach using local substructures is capable of describing protein-ligand interaction for largely different proteins and hence opens up for proteochemometrics-analysis of the interaction-space of entire proteomes. Current approaches are limited to families of closely related proteins. families of closely related proteins.",

The reaction mechanism of GpdQ has been proposed to involve a nucleophilic attack by a terminally bound hydroxide molecule. The hydroxide species bridging the two metal ions is suggested to activate the nucleophile, thus favoring a sequential rather than a processive mechanism of action. Here, the hydrolysis of the two ester bonds in the substrate bis(para-nitrophenyl) phosphate (bpNPP) is probed using (31)P NMR. The kinetic rates measured compare well with those determined spectrophotometrically. Furthermore, the data indicate that the diester bonds are cleaved in two separate (non-processive) reactions, indicating that only a single nucleophile (the terminal hydroxide molecule) is likely to be employed as a nucleophile for GpdQ.",

        "abstract": "The effect of wood kraft pulp (KP) feed on dietary digestibility, ruminal fluid pH, rumen fermentation characteristics, and milk production performance in lactating dairy cows was examined. Four lactating dairy cows were used for the feeding experiment by the cross-over design. The control group and KP group were set up as treatments. The control group was fed total mixed ration (TMR) (40% roughage and 60% concentrate) and the KP group was fed TMR containing 12% KP that replaced half of the rolled corn in the control diet. The dry matter intake, digestibility of the feed components, and milk yield were not significantly different between control group and KP group. The number of times that the ruminal fluid pH was below 6.1 tended to decrease in the KP group compared to the control group (p < 0.10). The acetic acid ratio in the ruminal fluid of the KP group increased compared to the control group (p < 0.05) and the propionic acid ratio in the ruminal fluid of the KP group decreased compared to the control group (p < 0.05). The acetate:propionate acid ratio was increased in the KP group compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Lipopolysaccharide levels in the ruminal fluid of the KP group tended to decrease compared to the control group (p < 0.10). Based on these results, it was indicated that the use of KP feed for lactating dairy cows induced the same rumen fermentation characteristics as those in cows given a large amount of roughage without depressing milk productivity. Therefore, KP could be a valuable feed resource substitute for grains, which would also reduce the risk for subacute rumen acidosis.",

        "abstract": "Lassa fever is a hemorrhagic disease caused by Lassa fever virus (LV). Although the precise host defense mechanism(s) that affords protection against LV is not completely understood, cellular immunity mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) plays a pivotal role in controlling viral replication and LV infection. To date, there have been no reports mapping major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-binding CTL epitopes for LV. Using computer-assisted algorithms, we identified five HLA-A2.1-binding peptides of LV glycoprotein (GP) and two peptides from LV nucleoprotein (NP). Synthesized peptides were examined for their ability to bind to MHC class I molecules using a flow cytometric assay that measures peptide stabilization of class I. Three of the LV-GP peptides tested (LLGTFTWTL, SLYKGVYEL, and YLISIFLHL) stabilized HLA-A2. The LV-NP peptides tested failed to stabilize this HLA-A2. We then investigated the ability of the HLA-A2-binding LV-GP peptides to generate peptide-specific CTLs in HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice. Functional assays used to confirm CTL activation included gamma interferon enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays and intracellular cytokine staining of CD8+ T cells from peptide-primed mice. CTL assays were also performed to verify the cytolytic activity of peptide-pulsed target cells. Each of the LV-GP peptides induced CTL responses in HLA-A2-transgenic mice. MHC class I tetramers prepared using one LV-GP peptide that showed the highest cytolytic index (LLGTFTWTL) confirmed that peptide-binding CD8+ T cells were present in pooled lymphocytes harvested from peptide-primed mice. These findings provide direct evidence for the existence of LV-derived GP epitopes that may be useful in the development of protective immunogens for this hemorrhagic virus.",

Data on chronology of complications and certain cardiac risk categories were collected and analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was early termination of endoscopic procedures for a major cardiopulmonary complication in 2 of 135 patients (1.5%). The complications occurred on hospital day 0 postMI. Performance of endoscopic procedures on the day of the MI was found to be a risk factor for a procedure-related complication (P=0.02). ST segment elevation myocardial infarction was seen in 19 patients (16.0%), severely depressed ejection fraction in 30 patients (22.2%), and troponin-I peak greater than 1.6 ng/mL in 96 patients (71.0%). No statistically significant increased risk of endoscopy was found in these subsets of patients (P=0.99).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEndoscopic procedures can be safely performed early post-MI without imparting a significant cardiopulmonary risk. Timing of endoscopy increases risk of complications, but evidence of significant recent cardiac damage as demonstrated by ST segment elevation, depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, or troponin-I peak greater than 1.6 ng/mL does not increase risk of cardiopulmonary complication.",

        "title": "Integrative Medicine in Preventive Medicine Education: Competency and Curriculum Development for Preventive Medicine and Other Specialty Residency Programs.",
        "abstract": "During 2012, the USDHHS's Health Resources and Services Administration funded 12 accredited preventive medicine residencies to incorporate an evidence-based integrative medicine curriculum into their training programs. It also funded a national coordinating center at the American College of Preventive Medicine, known as the Integrative Medicine in Preventive Medicine Education (IMPriME) Center, to provide technical assistance to the 12 grantees. To help with this task, the IMPriME Center established a multidisciplinary steering committee, versed in integrative medicine, whose primary aim was to develop integrative medicine core competencies for incorporation into preventive medicine graduate medical education training. The competency development process was informed by central integrative medicine definitions and principles, preventive medicine's dual role in clinical and population-based prevention, and the burgeoning evidence base of integrative medicine. The steering committee considered an interdisciplinary integrative medicine contextual framework guided by several themes related to workforce development and population health. A list of nine competencies, mapped to the six general domains of competence approved by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education, was operationalized through an iterative exercise with the 12 grantees in a process that included mapping each site's competency and curriculum products to the core competencies. The competencies, along with central curricular components informed by grantees' work presented elsewhere in this supplement, are outlined as a roadmap for residency programs aiming to incorporate integrative medicine content into their curricula. This set of competencies adds to the larger efforts of the IMPriME initiative to facilitate and enhance further curriculum development and implementation by not only the current grantees but other stakeholders in graduate medical education around integrative medicine training.",

        "abstract": "Microevolutionary studies often find that complex quantitative characters are highly evolvable and adapted to the local environment, while macroevolutionary studies often show evidence of strong phylogenetic effects and stasis. In this contribution, we show how phylogenetic comparative methods can be used to test hypotheses that may help resolve this paradox. As a test case, we studied the interplay between adaptation and phylogenetic inertia on the thermobiology of 32 species of Liolaemus (Squamata: Liolaemidae), a genus of South American lizards living under diverse climatic conditions. Despite a strong phylogenetic effect in the preferred (selected) body temperature, we found clear evidence that this variable is adapted to local temperature and climate. After controlling for adaptation to the thermal environment, little influence of phylogeny was left. This indicates that the phylogenetic effect was not caused by a lag or slowness in adaptation but primarily by the distribution of the thermal environments on the phylogeny. This can be due to thermal niche tracking. In contrast, we found little or no evidence for adaptation to the thermal environment in either cooling or heating rates, critical thermal minimum, or body size.",

        "abstract": "In this article we report that the distribution of serotonin in the lobster nervous system parallels the distribution of octopamine and that the same tissues that contain endogenous serotonin can synthesize it from tryptophan. Octopamine and serotonin are highly concentrated in a neurosecretory region of the second thoracic roots in association with a group of neurosecretory cells. The roots possess separate high-affinity uptake systems for both serotonin and tryptophan. Radioactive serotonin, accumulated in tissues during incubations with either tritiated serotonin or tritiated tryptophan, can be released, in a calcium-dependent manner, by depolarization with potassium. A detailed morphological examination of the second thoracic roots shows four distinct categories of nerve endings in the vicinity of the neurosecretory cells. Octopamine is synthesized in one of these types of endings and serotonin in another. The high-affinity uptake systems for serotonin and tryptophan are found only in association with the endings that make serotonin. These endings and all the biochemical parameters of serotonin metabolism in the roots are selectively destroyed by previous injection of animals with the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine.",

        "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and internet gaming disorder (IGD), which are similar in that both involve repetitive behaviors and related with cognitive dysfunctions, frequently begin in early adolescence, which is a critical period for learning. Although the deterioration in cognitive functioning caused by these conditions may have adverse effects on information processing, such as text reading, there has been no comprehensive research on the objective indicators of altered reading patterns in these patients. Therefore, we evaluated eye-movement patterns during text reading in patients with OCD or IGD. In total, 20 patients with OCD, 28 patients with IGD and 24 healthy controls (HCs) participated in the reading task using an eye tracker. We compared the fixation durations (FDs), saccade amplitudes and eye-movement regressions of the three groups during reading. We explored relationships between the parameters reflecting altered reading patterns and those reflecting the severity of clinical symptoms. The average FDs and forward saccade amplitudes did not differ significantly among the groups. There were more eye-movement regressions in patients with OCD than in patients with IGD and HCs. No correlation was found between altered eye-movement patterns during reading and the severity of clinical symptoms in any of the patient groups. The significantly increased number of regressions (NRs) in the OCD group during reading may reflect these patients' difficulties with inferential information processing, whereas the reading pattern in the IGD group is relatively intact. These findings suggest that patients with OCD and patients with IGD have different eye-movement patterns during reading reflecting distinct cognitive impairments in the two patient groups.",

This study aimed to determine the types of post-transplant malignancy, incidence, and related factors in renal transplant recipients referred to Razi Hospital in Rasht, Iran.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 549 kidney transplant recipients between 1998 and 2018. Patient-, transplant-, and medication-related factors and pathology reports were recorded in the check list. Chi-square, T-test and Logistic Regression were used to investigate the effect of variables. Malignancy-person-year incidence rate was calculated using survival tables and Kaplan-Mayer analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\n43 (7.8%) recipients had malignancies. The most common site of malignancy was the skin (53.5%). Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC) was the most common cancer (32.6%) followed by Kaposi sarcoma (20.9%). The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of post-transplant malignancies in renal transplant recipients was 26.9 times the malignancies in Guilan province and 21.7 times the malignancies in Iran. Cox proportional hazard models identified older age at the time of transplantation and history of azathioprine consumption seems to be associated with risk for post-transplant malignancy.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe most common malignancies in these people were non-melanoma skin cancer, Kaposi sarcoma and then GI malignancies. According to the information obtained in this study, regular periodic examinations of kidney transplant recipients for early detection of malignancy is important.",

        "abstract": "Streptococcus pyogenes strains can be divided into two classes, one capable and the other incapable of producing H2O2 (M. Saito, S. Ohga, M. Endoh, H. Nakayama, Y. Mizunoe, T. Hara, and S. Yoshida, Microbiology 147:2469-2477, 2001). In the present study, this dichotomy was shown to parallel the presence or absence of H2O2-producing lactate oxidase activity in permeabilized cells. Both lactate oxidase activity and H2O2 production under aerobic conditions were detectable only after glucose in the medium was exhausted. Thus, the glucose-repressible lactate oxidase is likely responsible for H2O2 production in S. pyogenes. Of the other two potential H2O2-producing enzymes of this bacterium, NADH and alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase, only the former exhibited low but significant activity in either class of strains. This activity was independent of the growth phase, suggesting that the protein may serve in vivo as a subunit of the H2O2-scavenging enzyme NAD(P)H-linked alkylhydroperoxide reductase. The activity of lactate oxidase was associated with the membrane while that of NADH oxidase was in the soluble fraction, findings consistent with their respective physiological roles, i.e., the production and scavenging of H2O2. Analyses of fermentation end products revealed that the concentration of lactate initially increased with time and decreased on glucose exhaustion, while that of acetate increased during the culture. These results suggest that the lactate oxidase activity of H2O2-producing cells oxidizes lactate to pyruvate, which is in turn converted to acetate. This latter process proceeds presumably via acetyl coenzyme A and acetyl phosphate with formation of extra ATP.",

        "abstract": "The search for diagnostic biomarkers for pulmonary embolism (PE) has mainly been focused on blood samples. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a possible source for biomarkers specific for chronic lung diseases and cancer, yet no previous studies have investigated the potential of EBC for diagnosis of PE. The protein content in the EBC is very low, and efficient condensing of the EBC is important in order to obtain high quality samples for protein analysis. We investigated if advanced proteomic techniques in a porcine model of acute intermediate-high-risk PE was feasible using two different condensing temperatures for EBC collection. Seven pigs were anaesthetized and intubated. EBC was collected one hour after intubation. Two autologous emboli were induced through the right external jugular vein. Two hours after the emboli were administered, EBC was collected again. Condensing temperature was either -21 °C or -80 °C. Nano liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS) was used to identify and quantify proteins of the EBC. A condensing temperature of -80 °C significantly increased the EBC volume compared with -21 °C (1.78 ± 0.25 ml vs 0.71 ± 0.12 ml) while the protein concentration in the EBC was unaltered. The mean protein concentration in the EBCs was 5.85 ± 0.93µg ml-1, unaltered after PE. In total, 254 proteins were identified in the EBCs. Identified proteins included proteins of the cytoplasm, nucleus, plasma membrane and extracellular region. The protein composition did not differ according to condensing temperature. The EBC from pigs with acute intermediate-high-risk PE contained sufficient amounts of protein for analysis by nLC-MS/MS. The proteins were from relevant cellular compartments, indicating that EBC is a possible source for biomarkers for acute PE.",

Attached cells were stained and the ratio of GGT-positive/GGT-negative cells (GGT-ratio) was determined. The initial GGT-ratio was 10.4 +/- 4.7% and an increased ratio was taken as a sign of toxicity that resulted in a selection of GGT-positive cells. In a first series of experiments it was shown that hydroquinone and menadione increase the GGT-ratio, while diquat, sodium selenite, diethyl maleate or phorone do not. However, diethyl maleate in combination with diquat increased the GGT-ratio. Hydrogen peroxide (5 mM) increased the GGT-ratio as effectively as hydroquinone (0.3 mM). Lower concentrations of H2O2 (0.05 mM) increased the GGT-ratio in GSH-depleted cells. The changes induced by hydroquinone and H2O2 in low concentration were reversible. In another series of experiments, plates coated with antibodies against beta 1-integrin were used. An increase in the GGT-ratio was obtained with anti beta 1-integrin, but not with broad spectrum anti-rat hepatocyte or anti-rat beta 2-microglobulin antibodies as substrata. These data suggested an involvement of the beta 1-integrin in the selection. Taken together, these data indicate that GGT-positive hepatocytes are protected against GSH depletion and oxidative stress that may result in reversible receptor alterations.",

        "abstract": "A convenient method is described for the intracistronic mapping of genetic sites responsible for electrophoretic variation of a specific protein in Drosophila melanogaster. A number of wild-type isoalleles of the rosy locus have been isolated which are associated with the production of electrophoretically distinguishable xanthine dehydrogenases. Large-scale recombination experiments were carried out involving null enzyme mutants induced on electrophoretically distinct wild-type isoalleles, the genetic basis for which is followed as a nonselective marker in the cross. Additionally, a large-scale recombination experiment was carried out involving null enzyme rosy mutants induced on the same wild-type isoallele. Examination of the electrophoretic character of crossover and convertant products recovered from the latter experiment revealed that all exhibited the same parental electrophoretic character. In addition to documenting the stability of the xanthine dehydrogenase electrophoretic character, this observation argues against a special mutagenesis hypothesis to explain conversions resulting from allele recombination studies.",

Photoredox catalysis has offered an alternative method toward ketone-olefin coupling reactions, although most methods are limited in scope to easily reducible aromatic carbonyl compounds. Herein, we describe a mild, metal-free ketone-olefin coupling reaction using an excited-state acridine radical super reductant as a photoredox catalyst.

        "abstract": "Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are an attractive model organism for a variety of scientific studies, including host-microbe interactions. The organism is particularly useful for the study of aquatic microbes that can colonize vertebrate hosts, including Vibrio cholerae, an intestinal pathogen. V. cholerae must colonize the intestine of an exposed host for pathogenicity to occur. While numerous studies have explored various aspects of the pathogenic effects of V. cholerae on zebrafish and other model organisms, few, if any, have examined how a V. cholerae infection alters the resident intestinal microbiome and the role of the type six secretion system (T6SS) in that process. In this study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was utilized to investigate how strains of V. cholerae both with and without the T6SS alter the aforementioned microbial profiles following an infection. V. cholerae infection induced significant changes in the zebrafish intestinal microbiome, and while not necessary for colonization, the T6SS was important for inducing mucin secretion, a marker for diarrhea. Additional salient differences to the microbiome were observed based on the presence or absence of the T6SS in the V. cholerae utilized for challenging the zebrafish hosts. We conclude that V. cholerae significantly modulates the zebrafish intestinal microbiome to enable colonization and that the T6SS is important for pathogenesis induced by the examined V. cholerae strains. Furthermore, the presence or absence of T6SS differentially and significantly affected the composition and structure of the intestinal microbiome, with an increased abundance of other Vibrio bacteria observed in the absence of V. cholerae T6SS.",

        "abstract": "The interaction of 4,6-dinitrobenzo[d]isoxazole-3-carbonitrile (5a) with methoxide ion has been kinetically investigated in methanol and a 20:80 (v/v) MeOH-Me2SO mixture. In methanol, stopped-flow experiments have revealed that a monomethoxyl sigma-adduct (5a-Me) is first formed, resulting from a fast MeO- addition at the unsubstituted 7-carbon. Rate and equilibrium constants for this sigma-complexation process could be determined, allowing a ranking of 5a within the pKa scale established for Meisenheimer electrophiles in methanol. With a pKa value of 13.50, the electrophilicity of 5a falls in the range of 1,3,6,8-tetranitronaphthalene, 2,4-dinitrothiophene or 4-nitrobenzofuroxan. This corresponds to a two-pKa units increase in electrophilicity from that of TNB, the common reference in sigma-complex chemistry but it is notably below that of so-called superelectrophilic molecules like 4,6-dinitrobenzofuroxan. In addition to its ease of sigma-complexation, 5a is found to undergo a slow but thermodynamically favourable addition of MeO- to the cyano group bonded to the isoxazole ring, leading to a complete conversion of the adduct 5a-Me into a dinitroimidate 6. The reactivity of 6 could be kinetically assessed. Going to 80% Me2SO still afforded initially the adduct 5a-Me but this anionic species undergoes addition of a second molecule of MeO- to the CN group, giving a dianion whose structure is unprecedented in the literature. Combining the above results with synthetic observations showing that 5a can readily contribute to S(N)Ar reactions under appropriate experimental conditions emphasizes the multifaceted electrophilic reactivity of this electron-deficient heterocycle.",

Since then, resection has been performed on 18 patients. In seven of these patients resection proved impractical because of the extension of a neoplasm into the portal vein or liver, therefore palliative decompression was performed. In 11 patients (61%) tumor resection, followed by reconstruction of the biliary tree, was performed successfully. All the resected tumors were adenocarcinomas of the proximal bile ducts. Four patients had simple hepatic duct resection. In two patients duct resection was associated with right lobectomy, in three patients with left lobectomy, in one patient with segmentectomy, and in one patient with excision of the right branch of the hepatic artery. There were two postoperative deaths. The mean survival time for the remaining nine patients is 521 days. Five patients were alive in August 1978, at intervals ranging from 175 to 1180 days after resection. These results contrast favorably with those obtained between 1968 and 1973, during which period nine patients had palliative decompression, with three postoperative deaths and a mean survival time of 164 days for the remaining six patients.",

The objective of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of HCR versus percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) drug-eluting stenting in left main treatment.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA series of 198 consecutive patients with left main stenosis have been treated. HCR, was performed in 77 patients (G1) whereas 121 patients (G2) received PCI on left main. An adjusted analysis using inverse probability weighting (IPW) was performed. Primary outcomes include: 30-day mortality, postoperative acute myocardial infarction, 18 months' MACCEs: cardiac death, stroke, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), repeated target vessel revascularization (TVR).\n\n\nRESULTS\nSYNTAX score was 29.5 ± 6.9 in G1 and 29.1 ± 6.5 in G2 (P = 0.529). In G2, three patients (2.7%) died because of cardiogenic shock; no deaths occurred in G1 (P = 0.603). No major complications were reported in G1 and there was no mortality at 18 months' follow-up in both groups. Survival freedom from MACCEs at 18 months' follow-up was significantly higher in G1 (G1: 93.3 ± 4.6% versus G2: 72.3 ± 6.3; P = 0.001) mostly because of the higher freedom from TVR (G1: 93.3 ± 4.6% versus G2: 75.5 ± 5.6; P = 0.002). At Cox regression analysis, PCI was an independent predictor of MACCEs and TVR (hazard ratio 3.9, CI 1.36-9.6; P = 0.027).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPCI in patients with left main and multivessel disease is a viable strategy, with a good outcome. HCR, demonstrated a lower incidence of cardiac adverse events such as AMI and TVR. Future comparative studies will be helpful to identify the optimal patient population for HCR.",

        "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a principal driver for most oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCCs), where it is strongly associated with improved survival. HPV is much less frequently detected in squamous cell carcinomas arising in nonoropharyngeal sites (non-OPSCCs), and its pathogenic role and prognostic value in these tumors is unclear. We evaluated the clinicopathologic features of 52 non-OPSCCs considered HPV-positive based upon p16 immunohistochemistry and direct HPV detection using RNA in situ hybridization (ISH), DNA ISH, or real-time DNA polymerase chain reaction. The HPV-positive non-OPSCCs were from the larynx (n=27), oral cavity (n=21), and hypopharynx (n=4). While most cases (n=34, 65%) showed classic histologic features of HPV-positive OPSCC, including endophytic growth, minimal keratinization, and hyperchromatic nuclei without koilocytic changes, a subset (n=13, 25%) were characterized by exophytic growth, exuberant surface hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis, marked nuclear pleomorphism, and prominent koilocytic atypia. These antithetical features were highly reminiscent of the warty variant of HPV-positive squamous cell carcinoma described in anogenital sites. Compared with tumors without warty features, the warty tumors presented at lower stage and were not associated with lymph node metastasis, local recurrence, or distant spread (4 y disease-free survival of 100% vs. 66%, P=0.069). The presence of transcriptionally active HPV as detected by RNA ISH suggests a pathogenic role for HPV in these nonoropharyngeal sites. While most HPV-positive non-OPSCCs are morphologically similar to their tonsillar counterparts, this study highlights a previously unrecognized warty variant that may be associated with a highly favorable clinical outcome.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the asymmetric effects of economic growth, energy use, and financial development, on carbon dioxide emissions in Saudi Arabia, from 1971 to 2014, using the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model. Prior to the application of the model, the integration proprieties of the variables were examined employing the recently RALS-LM (Residual Augmented Least squares-Lagrange Multiplier) unit root test, with two endogenous structural breaks. The main finding is that there exists an asymmetric cointegration relationship among the variables. In the long-run, both positive and negative shocks in economic growth rise emissions, but the effect of positive shocks is larger. In addition, both positive shocks in energy consumption and negative shocks in financial development surge CO2 emissions. In the short-run, the increasing economic growth is being made at the expense of the polluted environment. In contrast, any decrease in the economic growth would contribute to the improvement of environmental quality. Furthermore, positive shocks on energy consumption surges CO2 emissions and positive shocks in financial development reduces emissions. The asymmetric causality test of Hatemi-J (2012) suggests that economic growth (positive shocks) causes carbon dioxide emissions. At the same time, CO2 emissions (positive shocks) cause energy consumption. However, no significant causal relationship is found between financial development and CO2 emissions. In light of these findings, some policy implications are recommended.",

Heparin effect on the activated partial thromboplastin time also was assessed in the same specimens. The XaI and LLHPT assays had comparable precision and provided linear results over a wide range of heparin concentrations. Both assays slightly underestimated the total amount of heparin added to the specimens. The most rapid test was the whole blood LLHPT assay; this test therefore may be useful for bedside monitoring of heparin. A significant disadvantage of the LLHPT assay was the large sample size required to perform it.

Further, curcumin prevented surgery-induced anti-oxidant enzyme activity. Curcumin also increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-positive area and expression of pAkt in the brain, suggesting that curcumin activated BDNF signaling in aged mice. Furthermore, curcumin neutralized cholinergic dysfunction involving choline acetyltransferase expression induced by surgery. These results strongly suggested that curcumin prevented cognitive impairments via multiple targets, possibly by increasing the activity of anti-oxidant enzymes, activation of BDNF signaling, and neutralization of cholinergic dysfunction, concurrently.

In this study, nitrated human fibrinogen, a potential oxidative stress biomarker for several pathologies, was chosen as the target. To improve the sensitivity and overcome the interference caused by the complexity of human biofluids, we developed three sandwich strategies using various combinations of primary antibody and secondary antibody. All three strategies demonstrated high sensitivity and selectivity towards nitrated forms of fibrinogen in buffer, but their performances were dramatically reduced when tested with human plasma and serum samples. Systematically optimizations were carried out to investigate the effects of numerous factors, including sampling, coating, blocking, and immunoreactions. Our final optimization results indicate that two of these strategies retain sufficient sensitivity and selectivity for use as assays in human physiological samples. Specifically, detection limits reached the pM level and the linear response ranges were up to nM level with a correlation coefficient>0.99. To our best knowledge, this is the first example of using an electrochemical immunoassay for a nitrated biomarker in a physiological fluid. This novel approach provides a rapid, sensitive, selective, cost efficient and robust bioassay for detection of oxidative stress in pathology and for clinical applications. Moreover, the sandwich strategies developed in this paper can be readily used to establish effective methods targeting other nitration biomarkers.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in the Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 (PMP22) leads to Charcot Marie Tooth type 1A (CMT1A, a subtype of CMT1) disease which is the most common inherited neuropathy of peripheral nervous system. In the present study, we used series of in silico prediction methods to screen and identify the most deleterious non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) in PMP22 gene. Out of 48 nsSNPs, five nsSNPs (L16P, L19P, T23R, W28R, and L147R) associated with PMP22 were predicted to be highly deleterious and destabilizing the protein. To explore the possible structure-function relationship, we employed abinitio modeling strategy using the CABS-fold server to predict the three-dimensional structure models in the absence of crystallized structures in PMP22 protein. We used Cytoscape 3.4.0 plugin Integrated Complex Traits Networks interface (iCTNet) to identify the probable drug-gene interactions in PMP22 gene. A total of 22 chemical compounds yielded from the aforementioned tool was subjected to Molinspiration and OSIRIS program to screen and identify the potent drug molecules for further analysis. Five chemical compounds with excellent bioavailability and drug relevant property were selected for molecular docking simulation study. We modeled five mutant structures at their corresponding positions and performed molecular docking simulation analysis using AutoDock Tools (ADT) version 1.5.6 and ArgusLab 4.0.1 tools to analyze their interaction patterns and binding efficacy. Based on the results obtained from the computational study, we predict that estradiol could be a potential drug of choice for treating patients with CMT1A which needs larger attention from biologists in the near future.

        "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with premature atherothrombotic complications. Hyperhomocysteinemia is considered a cardiovascular risk factor. Increased vascular stiffness may increase cardiovascular mortality. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a noninvasive method of analyzing vascular stiffness in the assessment of atherosclerosis. The objective of this study was to identify the relationship between plasma homocysteine levels and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) measurement in SLE. Plasma homocysteine, baPWV, ankle-brachial index, blood pressure, C3, C4, anticardiolipin antibody (aCL), and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies were determined in a total of 58 female patients with SLE. The control group comprised 32 age-matched healthy females. In addition, all patients were further classified into subgroups according to the presence of aCL (SLE/aCL+, n=27 vs SLE/aCL-, n=31) to determine the effect of aCL on the tested variables. The mean values for plasma homocysteine and baPWV were 13.19 mumol/l and 1,482 cm/s, respectively. Plasma homocysteine levels were significantly elevated in SLE patients when compared with the healthy controls. SLE patients with aCL had a significantly higher plasma homocysteine level than those without aCL. A significant positive correlation between plasma homocysteine and baPWV was found in patients with SLE (r=0.335, P=0.028, n=58). Plasma homocysteine also significantly correlated with right baPWV in all SLE patients (r=0.371, P=0.014, n=58) and in the SLE/aCL+ group (r=0.523, P=0.031, n=27). These findings indicate a possible link between plasma homocysteine and baPWV in SLE. In conclusion, SLE patients had an increased level of plasma homocysteine, and this phenomenon appeared to be related to vascular stiffness.",

The most common cause of such ischemic changes of the anterior segment is the removal of too many rectus muscles in one operation. Twenty dog eyes and eight monkey eyes were subjected to the disinsertion and detachment of various combinations of extraocular muscles. They were sacrificed at intervals from 30 to 90 days. During the observation period, they were observed for gross and slit lamp changes. The enucleated eyes were studied microscopically for signs of ischemic and necrotic changes. Two patients who were studied, observed, and treated for anterior segment ischemia following muscle surgery are described. The changes which occur after muscle surgery are extensive and include corneal edema, cataract, chemosis, corneal changes, decreases in intraocular pressure, decreases in outflow or glaucoma and frank necrosis. The variables which lead to this reaction is described in detail. Also, some unanswered queries, such as the duration of the reaction and the time interval of the reaction after multiple muscle surgeries, are discussed.",

Non-stent-based local drug delivery by a drug-coated balloon (DCB) has been investigated, as it leaves no metallic mesh. A DCB consists of a semicompliant balloon coated with antiproliferative agents encapsulated in a polymer matrix, which is released into the wall after inflation and contact with the intima. DCB have demonstrated effectiveness in treating in-stent restenosis. Clinical studies using DCB in de novo coronary artery disease have shown mixed results, with a major benefit in small-vessel disease. Differences in study results are not only due to variations in DCB technology but also to disparity in procedural approach, \"leave nothing behind\" or \"combination therapy,\" and vessel size.

        "abstract": "BnPGIPs interacted with Sclerotinia sclerotiorum PGs to improve rapeseed SSR resistance at different levels; the BnPGIP-overexpression lines did not affect plant morphology or seed quality traits. Plant polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) play a crucial role in plant defence against phytopathogenic fungi by inhibiting fungal polygalacturonase (PG) activity. We overexpressed BnPGIP2, BnPGIP5, and BnPGIP10 genes in an inbred line 7492 of rapeseed (Brassica napus). Compared with 7492WT, the overexpression of BnPGIP2 lines significantly increased Sclerotinia sclerotiorum resistance in both seedlings and adult plants. BnPGIP5 overexpression lines exhibited decreased S. sclerotiorum disease symptoms in seedlings only, whereas BnPGIP10 overexpression lines did not improve Sclerotinia resistance for seedlings or adult plants. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of S. sclerotiorum PG1, SsPG3, SsPG5, and SsPG6 genes in overexpressing BnPGIP lines showed that these pathogenic genes in the Sclerotinia resistance transgenic lines exhibited low expression in stem tissues. Split-luciferase complementation experiments confirmed the following: BnPGIP2 interacts with SsPG1 and SsPG6 but not with SsPG3 or SsPG5; BnPGIP5 interacts with SsPG3 and SsPG6 but not with SsPG1 or SsPG5; and BnPGIP10 interacts with SsPG1 but not SsPG3, SsPG5, or SsPG6. Leaf crude protein extracts from BnPGIP2 and BnPGIP5 transgenic lines displayed high inhibitory activity against the SsPG crude protein. BnPGIP-overexpression lines with Sclerotinia resistance displayed a lower accumulation of H2O2 and higher expression of the H2O2-removing gene BnAPX (ascorbate peroxidase) than 7492WT, as well as elevated expression of defence response genes including jasmonic acid/ethylene and salicylic acid pathways after S. sclerotiorum infection. The plants overexpressing BnPGIP exhibited no difference in either agronomic traits or grain yield from 7492WT. This study provides potential target genes for developing S. sclerotiorum resistance in rapeseed.",

Sometimes health assessments are included, usually by quantitative risk assessments which are subject to the limits of scientific knowledge and bedevilled by data limitations. The goal must be to add health to the process, yet the relevant features to include are complex. Impacts are non-specific and they interact and have spatial and temporal characteristics. To integrate environment into population health, there is a need for a physical environment-health database and inter-sectorial policy and action.

[Phys. Rev. Lett., 2008, 101, 233401]. The frequencies of the a-type series, which evolves from the end-over-end rotation of the dimer, decrease from N = 1 to 3, then increase smoothly to at least N = 9. This turnaround indicates a rapid evolution of the solvation character from classical to quantum. The b-type series, which evolves from the free molecule rotation of CO, increases from N = 0 to 6 and then decreases to at least N = 10. This is consistent with an initially increasing anisotropy of the helium environment, followed by a tendency of the solvation shell to become more isotropic. The shift of the vibrational frequency of CO as determined from the infrared [A. R. W. McKellar, J. Chem. Phys., 2004, 121, 6868; ibid., 2006, 125, 164328] and microwave data reveals an approximately linear decrease from N = 1 to at least 9. If the linear shift were to continue until completion of the first solvation shell (N approximately 14), the estimated helium nanodroplet shift will be well undershot [K. von Haeften, S. Rudolph, I. Simanovski, M. Havenith, R. E. Zillich and K. B. Whaley, Phys. Rev. B: Condens. Matter Mater. Phys., 2006, 73, 054502]. In this case, there must be an upturn in the vibrational shift beyond N = 14, which is not predicted by theory [T. Skrbić, S. Moroni and S. Baroni, J. Phys. Chem. A, 2007, 111, 7640]. By extrapolating the a-type series to N = 14 (assuming a linear vibrational shift), we estimate the rotational constant, B, of CO in the helium nanodroplet to be approximately 74% of its gas phase value. This is in reasonable agreement with simulations (76% at N = 14), which predict the limiting value to be approximately reached upon completion of the first solvation shell (73% at N = 100) [T. Skrbić, S. Moroni and S. Baroni, J. Phys. Chem. A, 2007, 111, 7640]. However, this value is significantly larger than that inferred from helium nanodroplet experiments (63%).",

The efficacy of new techniques for the treatment of oropharyngeal dysphagia have been examined in various populations. Exercise programs have been showing increased efficacy in particular patient groups.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nArticles in this past year have focused largely on identifying new procedures for assessment of oropharyngeal swallowing and defining treatment effects. Relatively little work has examined nutritional management in patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia. Most studies that have investigated nutritional management do not carefully define the patient's medical diagnosis or specific swallowing disorders. Similarly, those that study oropharyngeal dysphagia do not relate these data to nutritional management of these patients.",

Although activation of TRPV1 cation channels by capsaicin may reduce lipid storage and the formation of atherosclerotic lesions, a clinical use for capsaicin has been limited by its chronic toxicity. Here we show that coupling of copper sulfide (CuS) nanoparticles to antibodies targeting TRPV1 act as a photothermal switch for TRPV1 signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) using near-infrared light. Upon irradiation, local increases of temperature open thermo-sensitive TRPV1 channels and cause Ca2+ influx. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ activates autophagy and impedes foam cell formation in VSMCs treated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein. In vivo, CuS-TRPV1 allows photoacoustic imaging of the cardiac vasculature and reduces lipid storage and plaque formation in ApoE-/- mice fed a high-fat diet, with no obvious long-term toxicity. Together, this suggests CuS-TRPV1 may represent a therapeutic tool to locally and temporally attenuate atherosclerosis.",

        "title": "Reversible acetylation of PGC-1: connecting energy sensors and effectors to guarantee metabolic flexibility.",
        "abstract": "Organisms adapt their metabolism to meet ever changing environmental conditions. This metabolic adaptation involves at a cellular level the fine tuning of mitochondrial function, which is mainly under the control of the transcriptional co-activator proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator (PGC)-1alpha. Changes in PGC-1alpha activity coordinate a transcriptional response, which boosts mitochondrial activity in times of energy needs and attenuates it when energy demands are low. Reversible acetylation has emerged as a key way to alter PGC-1alpha activity. Although it is well established that PGC-1alpha is deacetylated and activated by Sirt1 and acetylated and inhibited by GCN5, less is known regarding how these enzymes themselves are regulated. Recently, it became clear that the energy sensor, AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) translates the effects of energy stress into altered Sirt1 activity by regulating the intracellular level of its co-substrate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)(+). Conversely, the enzyme ATP citrate lyase (ACL), relates energy balance to GCN5, through the control of the nuclear production of acetyl-CoA, the substrate for GCN5's acetyltransferase activity. We review here how these metabolic signaling pathways, affecting GCN5 and Sirt1 activity, allow the reversible acetylation-deacetylation of PGC-1alpha and the adaptation of mitochondrial energy homeostasis to energy levels.",

        "title": "Effects of cocaine intoxication on the threshold for stun gun induction of ventricular fibrillation.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nThis study sought to assess cocaine's effects on Taser-induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) threshold in a pig model.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nStun guns are increasingly used by law enforcement officials to restrain violent subjects, who are frequently intoxicated with cocaine and other drugs of abuse. The interaction of cocaine and the stun gun on VF induction is unknown.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe tested five adult pigs using a custom device built to deliver multiples of standard neuromuscular incapacitating (NMI) discharge that matched the waveform of a commercially available electrical stun gun (Taser X-26, Taser International, Scottsdale, Arizona). The NMI discharges were applied in a step-up and step-down fashion at 5 body locations. End points included determination of maximum safe multiple, minimum VF-inducing multiple, and ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) before and after cocaine infusion.\n\n\nRESULTS\nStandard NMI discharges (x1) did not cause VF at any of the 5 locations before or after cocaine infusion. The maximum safe multiple, minimum VF-inducing multiple, and VFT of NMI application increased with increasing electrode distance from the heart. There was a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in these values at each position after cocaine infusion, suggesting decreased cardiac vulnerability for VF. Cocaine increased the required strength of NMI discharge that caused 2:1 or 3:1 ventricular capture ratios at all of the positions. No significant changes in creatine kinase-MB and troponin-I were seen.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCocaine increased the VFT of NMI discharges at all dart locations tested and reduced cardiac vulnerability to VF. The application of cocaine increased the safety margin by 50% to 100% above the baseline safety margin.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the relationship between the physical office environment and the psychological well-being of office workers. The results indicate that adverse environmental conditions, especially poor air quality, noise, ergonomic conditions, and lack of privacy, may effect worker satisfaction and mental health. The data also provide substantial evidence that worker assessments of the physical environment are distinct from their assessments of general working conditions, such as work load, decision-making latitude and relationships with other people at work. Stated another way, people who reported problems with the physical environment could not simply be characterized as dissatisfied workers exhibiting a tendency to 'complain' about every aspect of their working conditions. Taken together, these findings lend support to the position that the stress people experience at work may be due to a combination of factors, including the physical conditions under which they labor. Both theoretical and practical considerations arise from these data, including the need for work site based health promotion and stress reduction programs to consider both the physical and psychological design of jobs.",

The method proposed in this paper is based on two basic requirements for a meaningful alignment. First, each sequence or segment of a sequence is characterized by a multivariate physicochemical profile. Second, the alignment is performed by considering all the sequences simultaneously, and the algorithm detects those regions that form a set of similar profiles. In order to test the structural meaning of the alignment obtained from the sequences, quantitative comparisons are performed with structurally conserved regions (SCR) determined from the X-ray structures of three serine proteases. Results suggest that the limits of the SCR may be predicted from the similarities between the physicochemical profiles of the sequences. The procedures are not completely automated. The final step requires a visual screening of alternative pathways in order to determine an optimal alignment.",

Analysis of these compounds in environmental samples has to be very sensitive and selective so that their concentrations corresponding to the low environmental target values can also be detected. Generally, analysis of a complex matrix leads to high interferences during the different process steps; clean-up procedures are recommended to overcome this problem. For the past many years, solid phase extraction by employing imprinted materials has been extensively used for many organic substances that are used for pre-concentration and clean-up purposes with excellent results. Here, we present three different imprinted polymers prepared via bulk, precipitation, and emulsion polymerization methods that use similar compositions. The synthesized polymer particles were characterized morphologically by employing scanning electron microscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis. Binding properties were calculated using the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm. Depending on the properties of the materials, different analytical applications for complex matrices are proposed. These applications are mainly used on tributyltin and its degradation products for environmental analysis.",

        "abstract": "The controversy over the creation of admixed human-nonhuman embryos, and specifically of what have been termed \"cybrids,\" involves a range of ethical and political issues. It is not reducible to a single question. This paper focuses on one question raised by that controversy, whether creating admixed human-nonhuman entities is \"an offense against human dignity. \"In the last decade there has been sustained criticism of the use of the concept of human dignity within bioethics. The concept has been criticized as \"vague\" and \"useless.\" Nevertheless, the concept continues to be invoked in bioethical discussion and in international instruments. This paper defends a concept of human dignity that is coherent but that is wider than contemporary post-Kantian approaches. \"Human dignity\" is best regarded as having a set of analogically related meanings, more than one of which is relevant to the field of bioethics. A more subtle understanding of the concept of human dignity can help identify what is ethically problematic in human-nonhuman combinations and so shed light on one aspect of the admixed embryo debate.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPaediatric studies have shown serum N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide levels to be a valuable tool in the surveillance of myocardial function and an early biomarker for rejection in transplant patients. The correlation between low mean right atrial pressure and increased inferior vena cava collapsibility index is well studied in adults. Our study aims to assess correlation between non-invasive measurements (serum N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide, inferior vena cava dimensions collapsibility, tricuspid regurgitation, and left ventricular remodelling index to invasive mean right atrial pressure in paediatric heart transplant patients).\n\n\nMETHODS\nA single centre, retrospective chart review of the paediatric transplant patients from 0 to 21 years of age was performed between 2015 and 2017. Thirty-nine patients had complete data which includes cardiac catheterisation, transthoracic echocardiogram, and serum N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide levels done within a two weeks of interval.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA higher inferior vena cava collapsibility index correlated with a lower mean right atrial pressure (r = -0.21, p = 0.04) and a larger inferior vena cava diameter in expiration indexed to body surface area (IVCmax/BSA0.5) correlated with a higher mean right atrial pressure (r = 0.29, p = 0.01). There was a correlation between elevated N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide and inferior vena cava collapsibility index (r = -0.38, p = 0.0001), IVCmax/BSA0.5 (r = 0.25, p = 0.0002), and mean right atrial pressure (r = 0.6, p = 0.0001).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSerum N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide levels correlated to non-invasive measurements (inferior vena cava collapsibility index and IVCmax/BSA0.5) and to the invasive mean right atrial pressure. Non-invasive (IVC-CI IVCmax/BSA0.5) correlates with elevated mean right atrial pressure in this population. Together, these may serve as a reliable surveillance tool in assessing right heart filling pressures and cardiac function within the paediatric heart transplant patient.",

        "abstract": "Melatonin is produced in the dark by the pineal gland and is a key regulator of circadian and seasonal rhythms. A low melatonin level has been reported in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but the underlying cause of this deficit was unknown. The ASMT gene, encoding the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis, is located on the pseudo-autosomal region 1 of the sex chromosomes, deleted in several individuals with ASD. In this study, we sequenced all ASMT exons and promoters in individuals with ASD (n=250) and compared the allelic frequencies with controls (n=255). Non-conservative variations of ASMT were identified, including a splicing mutation present in two families with ASD, but not in controls. Two polymorphisms located in the promoter (rs4446909 and rs5989681) were more frequent in ASD compared to controls (P=0.0006) and were associated with a dramatic decrease in ASMT transcripts in blood cell lines (P=2 x 10(-10)). Biochemical analyses performed on blood platelets and/or cultured cells revealed a highly significant decrease in ASMT activity (P=2 x 10(-12)) and melatonin level (P=3 x 10(-11)) in individuals with ASD. These results indicate that a low melatonin level, caused by a primary deficit in ASMT activity, is a risk factor for ASD. They also support ASMT as a susceptibility gene for ASD and highlight the crucial role of melatonin in human cognition and behavior.",

To recognize subclinical renal dysfunction, a battery of new, non-invasive tests was applied in comparison to established ones. The study on cadmium exposed subjects, performed within the framework of a collaborative European research project, exemplifies the concept of target selectivity within a nephron. One hundred seventy-two subjects were classified according to urinary cadmium excretion as controls (< 1.5 micrograms/g creatinine), or subjects with moderate or high cadmium body burden (1.5 to 5 micrograms/g creatinine, > 5 micrograms/g creatinine). Twenty-six urinary analytes (such as serum derived proteins, tubular enzymes, eicosanoids) and four plasma markers, related to the function or integrity of specific nephron segments, were investigated in a cross-sectional study. The group with the moderate cadmium body burden showed alterations of proximal tubular integrity, that is, increased excretion of tubular brush-border antigens. The group with higher cadmium body burden revealed an involvement of the whole nephron. The most prominent quantitative changes were found for the glomerular markers high molecular weight proteins, and thromboxane B2 and for the proximal tubular markers retinol binding protein, alpha 1-microglobulin, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, and the intestinal alkaline phosphatase. A diagnostic approach to screen for nephrotoxicity due to environmental hazards like cadmium should include proximal tubular markers (alpha 1-microglobulin and tubular enzymes, that is, intestinal alkaline phosphatase) but the measurement of glomerular markers is also advisable.",

        "abstract": "The development of a gay or lesbian identity (often referred to as the coming out process) has been widely studied in adults; however, few studies have examined the process in gay adolescents. Even among these studies, little research has investigated the effects of race or family values on the coming out process. A small sample of African-American, Hispanic/Latino, Asian/Eurasian, and Caucasian gay male adolescents participated in this survey study. Coming out was operationalized in three stages: sensitization; awareness with confusion, denial, guilt, and shame; and acceptance. The majority of respondents reported feeling different from other boys as children. The average age of first crush on another boy was 12.7 years; average age for realizing they were gay was 12.5 years. Most respondents reported feeling confused during their first awareness that they were gay. Denial of identity was a coping strategy for about half the sample. Traditional family values played a greater role in predicting coming out experiences than did race. Families were categorized as having high or low traditional values based upon (1) the importance of religion, (2) emphasis on marriage, (3) emphasis on having children, and (4) whether a non-English language was spoken in the home. Families with a strong emphasis on traditional values were perceived as less accepting of homosexuality than were the low traditional families. Those who work with adolescents need to be aware that some will recognize their sexual orientation as gay, lesbian, or bisexual during this time of their lives. These youth need support in the coming out process because they may encounter stigmatization and disapproval not only from the larger society, but also from their families, peers, and sometimes the gay community itself.",

However, the role of absorption in real metals has not been thoroughly considered. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that absorption leads to diminishing values of Purcell factor. We also suggest that using emitting organic compounds such as CBP (4,4-Bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1-biphenyl) can lead to a moderate increase of about an order of magnitude in the Purcell factor. Defining the experimentally measured Purcell factor as a ratio between the excited state lifetimes in bare CBP and in periodic structure, this increase in the fabricated periodic structure is demonstrated through a 4-8 times decrease in excited state radiative lifetime compared to a bare organic material in a wide emission spectrum.",

        "abstract": "We propose a multivariate theory for the pathogenesis of nasal polyps. Turbulent flow of air in the lateral wall of the nose or viral-bacterial-host interactions produce an inflammatory change in the mucosa of the lateral wall of the nose. Ulceration and prolapse of the submucosa with reepithelialization and new gland formation may then follow. The structural cells of the nasal polyp, including epithelial cells and fibroblasts, have the ability to produce messenger RNA for granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor and other cytokines. Stimulation of such an effector capability by structural cell-derived cytokines would undoubtedly represent a major amplification pathway of the inflammatory response in nasal polyps. Allergy may be one mechanism for the development of this cascade of events. This microenvironmental structural inflammatory response in the nasal polyp, in turn, can affect the bioelectric integrity of the Na+ and Cl- channels at the luminal surface of the respiratory epithelial cell. The change in the Na+ absorption, which has been demonstrated in our studies, may result in an increased movement of water into the cell and into the interstitial fluid. The resultant edema can lead to growth and enlargement of the nasal polyp. Finally, the rapid recurrence of nasal polyps despite adequate surgery may reflect some intrinsic phenotypic characteristic of nasal epithelial cells in the lateral wall of the nose, which is likely to be under genetic control.",

        "title": "The Synergistic Effect of Dietary Acid Load Levels and Cigarette Smoking Status on the Risk of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in Healthy, Middle-Aged Korean Men.",
        "abstract": "We investigated whether cigarette smoking and dietary acid load (DAL) are associated with a risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in healthy, middle-aged Korean men. Healthy men without diagnosed chronic disease (aged 40-64 years) from the KNHANES-VI (2013-2015) were included in the analysis (n = 774) and were subdivided by smoking status and DAL levels, as estimated using the quartile of net endogenous acid production (NEAP). The current smokers tended to have a higher risk of COPD than the never-smokers before and after adjustment. When divided by the DAL quartile, the Q4 group tended to have a higher risk of COPD than the Q1 group. Additionally, the current smokers with lower (Q2), modest (Q3), and the highest NEAP scores (Q4) showed risks of COPD that were more than fourfold higher than those of the never-smokers with the lowest NEAP scores (Q1). The ex-smokers with higher NEAP scores (Q3 and Q4) showed risks of COPD that were more than fourfold higher than those of the Q1 group. Interestingly, the risk of COPD was also more than sixfold higher in the never-smokers with the highest NEAP scores compared to that in the Q1 group. The NEAP scores and smoking status synergistically increased the risk of COPD in healthy, middle-aged Korean men. This suggests that DAL levels are an important factor in the prevention and management of COPD.",

        "title": "Pulmonary artery occlusion and lung collapse depletes rabbit lung adenosine triphosphate.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAlthough the bronchial circulation has traditionally been thought to provide adequate blood flow for the lung when the pulmonary artery is obstructed, recent studies have demonstrated that pulmonary artery occlusion results in lung injury. We hypothesized that after pulmonary artery occlusion, aerobic lung metabolic function is altered. We studied the changes in the concentration of adenine nucleotides as markers of injury in the intact rabbit lung after pulmonary artery occlusion in the presence and absence of pneumothorax.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA thoracotomy was performed on the rabbits, and on occlusive microvascular clamp was placed on the left pulmonary artery. The rabbit lungs were studied after 24 h of in vivo left pulmonary artery occlusion (n = 5), 24 h of left pulmonary artery occlusion with the lung collapsed by pneumothorax (n = 6), or 24 h of lung collapse alone (n = 5).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAdenosine triphosphate concentrations of the occluded left lung decreased dramatically at 24 h in the group with pulmonary artery occlusion and collapse (adenosine triphosphate concentration 196 +/- 32 ng/g for the left lung and 1,479 +/- 197 ng/g for the right lung; P < 0.001). There were no differences between the lungs in the rabbits undergoing occlusion alone or collapse alone.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAfter pulmonary artery occlusion or lung collapse, adenine nucleotides are preserved if ventilation is continued. The increased permeability of rabbit lungs after 24 h of left pulmonary artery occlusion alone cannot be explained on the basis of depletion of high-energy phosphates. In the absence of ventilation due to lung collapse, pulmonary artery occlusion results in decreased adenosine triphosphate concentrations, demonstrating that the residual circulations (bronchial and pulmonary venous flow) are inadequate to support normal lung aerobic metabolism.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nNumerous proposed surgical techniques have had minimal success in managing greater trochanter overgrowth secondary to retarded growth of the femoral capital epiphysis. For reconstruction of residual hip deformities, a novel type of proximal femur L-osteotomy was performed with satisfactory results. Although the clinical outcome was good, the biomechanical characteristics of the femur after such an osteotomy have not been clearly elucidated. Therefore, this study presents a three dimensional finite element analysis designed to understand the mechanical characteristics of the femur after the L-osteotomy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA patient with left hip dysplasia was recruited as the study model for L-osteotomy. The normal right hip was used as a reference for performing the corrective surgery. Four FEA models were constructed using different numbers of fixation screws but the same osteotomy lengths together with four FEA models with the same number of fixation screws but different osteotomy lengths. The von Mises stress distributions and femoral head displacements were analyzed and compared.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results revealed the following: 1). The fixation devices (plate and screws) sustained most of the external loading, and the peak value of von Mises stress on the fixation screws decreased with an increasing number of screws. 2). Additional screws are more beneficial on the proximal segment than on the distal segment for improving the stability of the postoperative femur. 3). The extent of osteotomy should be limited because local stress might be concentrated in the femoral neck region with increasing length of the L-osteotomy.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAdditional screw placement on the proximal segment improves stability in the postoperative femur. The cobra-type plate with additional screw holes in the proximal area might improve the effectiveness of L-osteotomies.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we investigated the enhancement of the electro-optic response by introducing electron-rich heteroatoms as additional donors into the donor or bridge of a conventional second-order nonlinear optical chromophore. A series of chromophores C2-C4 based on the same tricyanofuran acceptor (TCF) but with different heteroatoms in the alkylamino phenyl donor (C2 or C3) or thiophene bridge (C4) have been synthesized and systematically investigated. Density functional theory calculations suggested that chromophores C2-C4 had a smaller energy gap and larger first-order hyperpolarizability (β) than traditional chromophore C1 due to the additional heteroatoms. Single crystal structure analyses and optimized configurations indicate that the rationally introduced heteroatom group would bring larger β and weaker intermolecular interactions which were beneficial for translating molecular β into macro-electro-optic activity in electric field poled films. The electro-optic coefficient of poled films containing 25 wt% of these new chromophores doped in amorphous poly-carbonate afforded values of 83 and 91 pm V(-1) at 1310 nm for chromophores C3 and C4, respectively, which are two times higher than that of the traditional chromophore C1 (39 pm V(-1)). High r33 values indicated that introducing heteroatoms to the donor and bridge of a conventional molecular structure can efficiently improve the electron-donating ability, which improves the β. The long-chain on the donor or bridge part, acting as the isolation group, may reduce inter-molecular electrostatic interactions, thus enhancing the macroscopic EO activity. These results, together with good solubility and compatibility with the polymer, show the new chromophore's potential application in electro-optic devices.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nPeripheral polyneuropathy (PPN) can occur in diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, and after bariatric surgery (BS). We decided to evaluate PPN prevalence before (PreBS-PPN) and after BS (PostBS-PPN) and to look for variables that may be independently associated with both.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this cross-sectional study, we evaluated 1467 participants with obesity and without DM before and 10.4 ± 6.8 months after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG). The Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire were used to define the presence of PPN and the Metabolic Equivalent Task (MET) spent per week, respectively. Using Poisson regression models with a robust estimator, the prevalence of PreBS-PPN and PostBS-PPN was analyzed as dependent variables.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPrevalence of PostBS-PPN (10.5%) was lower than PreBS-PPN (20.4%, p < 0.001), with a prevalence of 12.7% post-RYGB and 8.4% post-SG (p = 0.072). In the univariate analysis, PreBS-PPN was associated with post-menopausal status (PMS), older age, and taller height. In twelve regression models, we found an independent association of PreBS-PPN with older age, PMS, and taller height. PostBS-PPN prevalence was associated with a higher fasting glycemia and stature, and a lower MET on univariate analysis, and with higher fasting glycemia, stature and RYGB in four multivariate regression models.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPPN occurs frequently in subjects with obesity without DM and is lower after BS. SG is not likely to be harmful in the development of neuropathy. Studies of PPN incidence and persistence after BS should clarify these factors.",

        "abstract": "Continuous and non-invasive measurement of intracranial pressure (ICP) in traumatic brain injury (TBI) is important to recognize increased ICP (IICP), which can reduce treatment delays. The purpose of this study was to develop an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based prediction model for IICP in a porcine TBI model. Thirty swine were anaesthetized and underwent IICP by inflating a Foley catheter in the intracranial space. Single-channel EEG data were collected every 6 min in 10 mmHg increments in the ICP from baseline to 50 mmHg. We developed EEG-based models to predict the IICP (equal or over 25 mmHg) using four algorithms: logistic regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). We assessed the performance of each model based on the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values. The accuracy of each prediction model for IICP was 0.773 for SVM, 0.749 for NB, 0.746 for RF, and 0.706 for LR. The AUC of each model was 0.860 for SVM, 0.824 for NB, 0.802 for RF, and 0.748 for LR. We developed a machine learning prediction model for IICP using single-channel EEG signals in a swine TBI experimental model. The SVM model showed good predictive power with the highest AUC value.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nThe main objective of this study was to describe geriatric recommendations based on a geriatric assessment (GA) and to evaluate the implementation of these recommendations.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nA two-step approach of screening followed by a GA was implemented in nine hospitals in Belgium. Patients ≥ 70 years were included at diagnosis or at disease progression/relapse. Concrete geriatric recommendations were systematically documented and reported to the treating physicians and consisted of referrals to professional health care workers. Patient charts were reviewed after one month to verify which geriatric recommendations have been performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFrom August 2011 to July 2012, 1550 patients were included for analysis. The median age was 77 (range: 70-97) and 57.0% were female. A solid tumour was diagnosed in 91.4% and a haematological malignancy in 8.6%. Geriatric screening with the G8 identified 63.6% of the patients for GA (n=986). A median of two geriatric recommendations (range: 1-6) were given for 76.2% (95%CI: 73.4-78.8) of the evaluable patients (n=710). A median of one geriatric recommendation (range: 1-5) was performed in 52.1% (95%CI: 48.4-55.8) of the evaluable patients (n=689). In general, 460 or 35.3% (95%CI: 32.8-38.0) of all the geriatric recommendations were performed. Geriatric recommendations most frequently consisted of referrals to the dietician (60.4%), social worker (40.3%), and psychologist (28.9%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis implementation study provides insight into GA-based recommendations/interventions in daily oncology practice. Geriatric recommendations were given in about three-fourths of patients. About one-third of all geriatric recommendations were performed in approximately half of these patients.",

Whereas DCK/VLO neurons are involved in eye movement control via their climbing fiber projection to the cerebellar flocculus, PO neurons control limb and digit movements via their climbing fiber projection to the lateral cerebellar hemisphere. In vitro patch recordings from DCK/VLO neurons revealed that low threshold calcium currents, Ih currents, and subthreshold oscillations are lacking in this subset of IO neurons. The recordings of activity in DCK neurons obtained by using voltage-sensitive dye imaging showed that activity is not limited to a single neuron, but rather that clusters of DCK neurons can be active in unison. These electrophysiological results show that the DCK/VLO neurons have unique properties that set them apart from the neurons in the PO nucleus. This finding indicates that motor control, from the perspective of the olivocerebellar system, is fundamentally different for the oculomotor and the somatomotor systems.",

However, most people, particularly the elderly, experience micronutrient deficiencies. This study aimed to establish reference intervals (RIs) for vitamins A and E in Chinese elderly people using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 356 apparently healthy individuals aged ≥64 years who underwent health checkups were randomly selected for the study. Vitamin A and E levels were measured using LC-MS/MS. The effect of sex on vitamin A and E levels was evaluated, and RIs were established using a parametric method.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFemales showed significantly higher levels of vitamin E than males (p < 0.05). However, no significant sex-specific difference was observed with vitamin A levels. The RI for vitamin A in the elderly was 0.283-0.730 mg/L. For vitamin E, the RIs were 4.39-15.63, 4.51-16.14, and 4.41-14.67 mg/L for the total, female, and male participants, respectively. In multiple linear regression, alanine aminotransferase, glutamyl transpeptidase, urea, glucose, and uric acid levels increased with increasing vitamin A levels (p < 0.05), and total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased with increasing vitamin E levels (p < 0.05). Direct bilirubin levels decreased with increasing vitamin E levels (p < 0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study established RIs for vitamins A and E in Chinese elderly individuals using an LC-MS/MS method.

        "abstract": "Social phobics exhibit an attentional bias for threat in probe detection paradigms. Attention training, whereby probes always replace non-threat in a display presenting both threat and non-threat, reduces attentional bias for threat and social anxiety. However, it remains unclear whether therapeutic benefits result from learning to disengage attention from threat or learning to orient attention towards non-threat. In this experiment, social phobics were randomly assigned to one of four training conditions: (1) disengagement from threat, (2) engagement towards non-threat, (3) disengagement from threat and re-engagement towards non-threat, and (4) a control condition. Effects were examined on subjective and behavioral responses to a subsequent stressor. Data revealed that training to disengage from threat reduces behavioral indices of anxiety. Engagement towards non-threat faces did not have effects in itself. These results support that the difficulty in disengaging attention from threat is a critical process in maintenance of the disorder.",

        "abstract": "The zinc finger transcription factors Mxr1p and Rop are key regulators of methanol metabolism in the methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, while Trm1p and Trm2p regulate methanol metabolism in Candida boidinii. Here, we demonstrate that Trm1p is essential for the expression of genes of methanol utilization (mut) pathway in P. pastoris as well. Expression of AOXI and other genes of mut pathway is severely compromised in P. pastoris ΔTrm1 strain resulting in impaired growth on media containing methanol as the sole source of carbon. Trm1p localizes to the nucleus of cells cultured on glucose or methanol. The zinc finger domain of Mxr1p but not Trm1p binds to AOXI promoter sequences in vitro, indicating that these two positive regulators act by different mechanisms. We conclude that both Trm1p and Mxr1p are essential for the expression of genes of mut pathway in P. pastoris and the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of mut pathway may be similar in P. pastoris and C. boidinii.",

        "title": "Identification of Symptomatic Carotid Artery Plaque: A Three-Item Scale Combined Angiography With Optical Coherence Tomography.",
        "abstract": "Introduction: Symptomatic carotid disease conveys a high risk of recurrent stroke. Plaque morphology and specific plaque characteristics are associated with the risk of stroke. This study aimed to evaluate the detailed plaque features by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and develop a simple scale combining clinical indicators, digital subtraction angiography (DSA), and OCT imaging markers to identify symptomatic carotid plaque. Methods: Carotid plaques from consecutive patients who underwent carotid OCT imaging between June 2017 and June 2021 were evaluated. Clinical characteristics, DSA, and OCT data were compared between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. Logistic regression was performed to identify the factors associated with symptomatic carotid plaque and to develop a scale. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the performance of the scale. Results: A total of 90 carotid plaques from 90 patients were included (symptomatic 35.6%, asymptomatic 64.4%). Three main factors were found to be associated with symptomatic carotid plaque: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) <0.925 mmol/L (OR, 4.708; 95% CI, 1.640 to 13.517; P = 0.004), irregular plaque (OR, 4.017; 95% CI, 1.250 to 12.910; P = 0.020), and white thrombus (OR, 4.594; 95% CI, 1.141 to 18.487; P = 0.032). The corresponding score of three items produced a scale with good discrimination (AUC, 0.768; 95% CI, 0.665 to 0.871). The optimal cutoff value of the scale was 1.5 points with 59.4% sensitivity and 84.5% specificity. Conclusion: The three-item scale comprising HDL-C <0.925 mmol/L, angiographical irregular plaque, and white thrombus detected by OCT may provide information to identify symptomatic carotid plaque. Further large-scale studies are required to validate whether the symptomatic carotid plaque scale is clinically valuable in recognizing carotid atherosclerosis in the early stages.",

        "abstract": "The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in tissue engineering has been extensively investigated. The greater the proliferation of this cellular group, the greater the regenerative and healing capacity of the tissue to which they belong. In this context, photobiomodulation (PBM) is an efficient technique in proliferation of distinct cell types. However, its parameters and mode of action are still unclear and require further investigation. This study aimed to evaluate the PBM action with different energies in MSCs of adipose tissue (hASCs). We used hASCs, seeded in 24-well plates, with 3 × 104 cells per well, in culture media. We used a total of four experimental groups, one with hASCs and simulated PBM and three other groups, which received PBM irradiation at 24, 48, and 72 h, with a 660-nm laser and power of 40 mW and energy of 0.56, 1.96, and 5.04 J. We performed analyses of MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromidefor) and trypan blue to evaluate cell proliferation and viability, 1 h after PBM irradiation. Software Graph PadPrism 7.0 was used. Intergroup comparisons were performed with ANOVA two-way and we used the Tukey post hoc test. Mitochondrial activity evaluated by MTT revealed the statistical difference in the first 24 h for group with more high energy when compared to control group; and in the 72 h for two irradiated groups when compared to the control group. The trypan blue test showed significant differences at the end of the experiment for two irradiated groups LG1 (4.52 × 104 ± 0.2) and LG2 (4.85 × 104 ± 0.8), when compared to the control group (1.87 × 104 ± 0.7). Both tests failed to be statistically different at the end of the experiment for groups LG1 and LG2 and observed a reduction in cellular mitochondrial growth and activity for group LG3. We conclude that PBM with energy close to 0.56 and 1.96 J promote proliferation of hASCs, and higher energy, such as 5.04 J, can be harmful.",

        "abstract": "Although cardiac transplantation offers prolonged survival and improved quality of life to patients with end-stage heart failure, many patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy do not undergo this procedure. Possible barriers to cardiac transplantation were examined among 138 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy from five hospitals in Washington, DC. Patients underwent follow-up for approximately 5 years. The patients or a close family member were interviewed at baseline about socioeconomic factors and medical history. The patients or their next-of-kin were recontacted at 1-year intervals to determine patients' vital status and to obtain information about cardiac transplantation. Overall, the cumulative survival at 12 and 60 months was 75.8% and 37.3%, respectively. Only 3.6% (5 of 138) of the patients underwent cardiac transplantation, and 19 (13.8%) patients had been placed on a waiting list for a heart transplant. Black race and nonmarried status were inversely associated with cardiac transplantation. Factors associated with not having been placed on a waiting list included older age, lower income, and lack of private health insurance. Black race was found to be significantly, but inversely associated with cardiac transplantation while older age was inversely associated with having been placed on a waiting list after adjusting for sex, race, education, and private insurance. These findings suggest that black patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy are less likely to undergo cardiac transplantation.",

        "abstract": "Visible-light driven photocatalysts are of great importance in wastewater treatment. In this work, fluorine and nitrogen co-doped titanium dioxide/silica nanocomposite (F-N-TiO2/SiO2) was synthetized using a sol-gel approach. The as-developed nanocomposite was well characterized using different techniques. In particular, an anatase structure with high surface area (345.69 m2/g) and a band gap of 2.97 eV were observed for the as-synthesized nanocomposite, which makes it a potential candidate for photocatalytic applications under visible light. A systematic density functional theory calculation was performed to get more insight into the effect of dopant atoms on the band gap of TiO2 nanoparticles. To enhance the reusability of the photocatalyst in semi-pilot scale, the as-developed nanocomposite was immobilized onto the glass beads by coupling dip-coating and heat attachment methods. A semi-pilot scale custom-designed fixed-bed photoreactor was used to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the as-developed nanocomposite under both visible and solar irradiations. A mixture of three azo dyes (i.e., basic red 29, basic blue 41 and basic yellow 51) was used as the model industrial wastewater. The analysis of the wastewater showed that the complete removal of the pollutants under visible light and sunlight can occurred at pH of 3 and flow rate of 280 mL/min. The durability results demonstrated the successful degradation of the pollutants for five cycles. The results of this study show how careful controlling the operational parameters as well as using a highly photocatalytic nanomaterial can lead to successful decontamination of organic water pollutants. This approach might open up new windows to the future applications of photocatalytic nanomaterials for wastewater treatment.",

        "abstract": "The effect of the endophytic Cupriavidus taiwanensis KKU2500-3 on the Cd toxicity of KDML105 rice seedlings was investigated in a 10 μM CdCl2 hydroponic system. As demonstrated after bacterial inoculation of germinating rice seeds, KKU2500-3 colonized all rice plant parts. In RB (Rice + KKU2500-3) and RBC (Rice + KKU2500-3+Cd), KKU2500-3 effectively colonized and was detected at a markedly higher number in the root surface and interior than in shoots and leaves. The activities of antioxidant enzymes ascorbate peroxidase (APOX), glutathione reductase (GR), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the proline content in inoculated rice were higher in roots and aboveground tissues. RBC exhibited a higher reduced-to-oxidized glutathione ratio in roots and leaves (3-55%) but a lower malondialdehyde content (8-78%). Phytochelatins (PCs) were detected in all rice tissues, but their levels in RBC were 13-70% lower than those in RC (Rice + Cd), demonstrating that the induction of PCs in rice was unrelated to KKU2500-3. The Cd levels in roots and shoots were lower in RBC than RC, and the root-to-shoot Cd translocation factor was 0.6-62.2% lower. At 30 DAT, the Cd levels in RBC roots and shoots were 30.2% and 73.7% lower, respectively, than those in RC. Colonized KKU2500-3 activated GR and increased the proline content to overcome rice Cd toxicity. These effects may trap Cd in plant cells and reduce its translocation. Hence, KKU2500-3 synergistically interacts with rice to detoxify Cd at early growth stages, and KDML105 rice grains with low Cd accumulation could be produced if this interaction is maintained until late growth stages.",

So far, it has not yet been well investigated whether specific psychiatric features (anxious traits, personality disorder, or somatization) may play a role in the BMS pathogenesis or whether some BMS symptoms, or BMS itself, may cause secondary psychiatric symptoms.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between pain, depression, and anxiety in BMS and healthy patients in order to hypothesize a possible underlying pathogenetic model.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFifty-three patients with BMS and 51 healthy volunteers matched for sex and age were enrolled. All patients underwent a physical examination, laboratory screening tests, and psychiatric assessment with the following instruments: Visual Analog Scale, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y 1-2 (STAI Y1-Y2), and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R).\n\n\nRESULTS\nBMS patients and healthy volunteers showed a statistically significant difference in psychiatric features: Regression analysis showed that pain is affected by depression (R = 0.373; R(2) corrected = 0.123; F = 8.563; P < .005), and depression is affected by anxiety (R = 0.512; R(2) corrected = 0.248; F = 18.519; P < .001). BMS patients have statistically significant higher scores of anxiety (STAI Y1, P = .026 and STAI Y2, P = .046) and depression (P < .001), and higher SCL-90-R scores on somatization (P = .036) and hostility dimensions (P = .028) than the control group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe may hypothesize that anxiety could determine a secondary demoralization in BMS patients (depression) and depressive symptoms could contribute to pain, accordingly. Therefore, pain could be a somatic feature of depression. Our findings provide an example of a possible pathogenetic model for BMS.",

        "abstract": "Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are promising candidates for high-energy storage devices due to high theoretical capacities of both the sulfur cathode and lithium (Li) metal anode. Considerable efforts have been devoted to improving sulfur cathodes. However, issues associated with Li anodes, such as low Coulombic efficiency (CE) and growth of Li dendrites, remain unsolved due to unstable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) and lead to poor capacity retention and a short cycling life of Li-S batteries. In this work, we demonstrate a facile and effective approach to fabricate a flexible and robust hybrid SEI layer through co-deposition of aromatic-based organosulfides and inorganic Li salts using poly(sulfur-random-1,3-diisopropenylbenzene) as an additive in an electrolyte. The aromatic-based organic components with planar backbone conformation and π-π interaction in the SEI layers can improve the toughness and flexibility to promote stable and high efficient Li deposition/dissolution. The as-formed durable SEI layer can inhibit dendritic Li growth, enhance Li deposition/dissolution CE (99.1% over 420 cycles), and in turn enable Li-S batteries with good cycling stability (1000 cycles) and slow capacity decay. This work demonstrates a route to address the issues associated with Li metal anodes and promote the development of high-energy rechargeable Li metal batteries.",

Serum uric acid (SUA) were measured and rest 12-lead electrocardiogram was performed. Multiple logistic regression models were used to explore risk factors for AF in very elderly. Finally, 1038 participants were included in analysis and the mean age of the study participants were 83.6 ± 3.4 years (age range 80-100 years). The mean SUA level was 350.1 ± 84.5 µmol/L. The estimated prevalence of AF was 5.3%, and there was no significant sex difference (5.8% for men and 4.8% for women, p = 0.401). Multiple logistic regression found that participants with hyperuricemia (SUA >416 µmol/L in men and >357 µmol/L in women) had a higher risk (odds ratio: 2.080, 95% confidence interval: 1.103-4.202, P = 0.007) of suffering AF in very elderly Chinese.

        "abstract": "To clarify the efficacy of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for adult ALL in first remission we retrospectively studied long-term outcomes of adult ALL patients of age between 15 and 44 years who were treated in our institute from 1980 to 1990. In this period thirteen patients with HLA compatible donors were offered allogeneic BMT during the first remission, while 16 patients without HLA-compatible donor were treated with maintenance chemotherapy (Cancer Chemoth Pharmacology 33:359-365, 1994). Patient and disease characteristics (age, leukocyte count at presentation, immunophenotype, Ph1 chromosome, and duration to first remission) in the two groups were not significantly different (chi-square test p > 0.1). As causes of treatment failure, relapse was 90% for chemotherapy while relapse and therapy-related death were 67% and 33%, respectively, for transplantation. The leukemia-free survival (LFS) rates at 10 years were 52 +/- 13% for transplantation and 30 +/- 11% for chemotherapy (P > 0.2, g-Wilcoxon, Logrank). The 10-year-LFS rates of Ph1-negative patients of 15 to 29 year-old were 67 +/- 15% for transplantation (n = 9) and 62 +/- 15% for chemotherapy (n = 8) (P > 0.9). Although the present data are derived from a non randomized retrospective study and a relatively small number of patients, this study revealed no superiority of BMT over chemotherapy for the prolongation of first remission in adult ALL, especially, in a standard risk group such as young patients without Ph1 chromosome.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nMicrocalcification is strongly correlated with papillary thyroid cancer. It is not clear whether macrocalcification is associated with malignancy. In this study, we aimed to assess the result of fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNAB) of thyroid nodules with macrocalcifications.\n\n\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS\nWe retrospectively evaluated 269 patients (907 nodules). Macrocalcifications were classified as eggshell and parenchymal macrocalcification. FNAB results were divided into four groups: benign, malignant, suspicious for malignancy, and non-diagnostic.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 79.9% female and 20.1% male and mean age was 56.9 years. Macrocalcification was detected in 46.3% nodules and 53.7% nodules had no macrocalcification. Parenchymal and eggshell macrocalcification were observed in 40.5% and 5.8% nodules, respectively. Cytologically, malignant and suspicious for malignancy rates were higher in nodules with macrocalcification compared to nodules without macrocalcification (p = 0.004 and p = 0.003, respectively). Benign and non-diagnostic cytology results were similar in two groups (p > 0.05). Nodules with eggshell calcification had higher rate of suspicious for malignancy and nodules with parenchymal macrocalcification had higher rates of malignant and suspicious for malignancy compared to those without macrocalcification (p = 0.01, p = 0.003 and p = 0.007, respectively).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur findings suggest that macrocalcifications are not always benign and are not associated with increased nondiagnostic FNAB results. Macrocalcification, particularly the parenchymal type should be taken into consideration.",

        "abstract": "Burns of the upper gastrointestinal tract, caused by acids, alkalis, drugs or heat may lead to stenoses, some of them severe, to perforations, to inanition and to the patient's death. The type of damage differs among the various groups of noxious agents. First aid at home is almost non existent. On admission every effort must be made to identify the ingested material. Parenteral fluids and antibiotics are used and in some patients nutritional support will be required. The extent of the damage must be evaluated endoscopically. Strictures, caused by intramuscular collagen formation, could possibly be prevented by steroid therapy. If stenoses occur, these must be cautiously dilated. A late complication of oesophageal burns is carcinoma. There appears to be a relation between this grave complication and the use of very hot beverages in certain countries where oesophageal cancer is common. Upper gastrointestinal burns are similar to skin burns, however, their dangers may be greater as they occur in a pipe-like structure and very close to vital viscera.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies identified cyclase-associated proteins (CAPs) as important regulators of actin dynamics that control assembly and disassembly of actin filaments (F-actin). While these studies significantly advanced our knowledge of their molecular functions, the physiological relevance of CAPs largely remained elusive. Gene targeting in mice implicated CAP2 in heart physiology and skeletal muscle development. Heart defects in CAP2 mutant mice were associated with altered activity of serum response factor (SRF), a transcription factor involved in multiple biological processes including heart function, but also skeletal muscle development. By exploiting mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from CAP2 mutant mice, we aimed at deciphering the CAP2-dependent mechanism relevant for SRF activity. Reporter assays and mRNA quantification by qPCR revealed reduced SRF-dependent gene expression in mutant MEFs. Reduced SRF activity in CAP2 mutant MEFs was associated with altered actin turnover, a shift in the actin equilibrium towards monomeric actin (G-actin) as well as and reduced nuclear levels of myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A), a transcriptional SRF coactivator that is shuttled out of the nucleus and, hence, inhibited upon G-actin binding. Moreover, pharmacological actin manipulation with jasplakinolide restored MRTF-A distribution in mutant MEFs. Our data are in line with a model in which CAP2 controls the MRTF-SRF pathway in an actin-dependent manner. While MRTF-A localization and SRF activity was impaired under basal conditions, serum stimulation induced nuclear MRTF-A translocation and SRF activity in mutant MEFs similar to controls. In summary, our data revealed that in MEFs CAP2 controls basal MRTF-A localization and SRF activity, while it was dispensable for serum-induced nuclear MRTF-A translocation and SRF stimulation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThere are few treatment options for mild-to-moderate anal incontinence with isolated internal anal sphincter defects or anal incontinence without muscle damage. Less-invasive techniques are generally favored.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo compare the results between the use of an anal bulking agent with polyacrylate-polyalcohol copolymer particles and endoanal electrical stimulation with biofeedback in patients with mild or moderate anal incontinence.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThis was a prospective parallel-group, single-institution, randomized clinical trial.\n\n\nSETTINGS\nThis study was conducted in an ambulatory setting at the Colorectal Physiology Service of the Hospital das Clinicas, Medical School, University of Sao Paulo.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nThis study included patients who had anal incontinence for >6 months with isolated internal anal sphincter muscle damage or absence of anatomical defects in the anorectal sphincter complex.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nAnal bulking agent and endoanal electrical stimulation with biofeedback.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe primary outcome measure was the Cleveland Clinic Florida Fecal Incontinence Score, and the secondary outcome measures included quality of life, recommended procedures, and anorectal manometry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were no significant between-group differences in mean age, sex, BMI, stool consistency, and Cleveland Clinic Florida Fecal Incontinence Score (p = 0.20) at baseline. After 12 months, the Cleveland Clinic Florida Fecal Incontinence Score was found to be significantly improved in patients treated with the bulking agent compared to those treated with electrical stimulation (mean, 6.2 vs 9.2; p = 0.002), though the anorectal manometry parameters did not change significantly. The mean anal Cleveland Clinic Florida Fecal Incontinence Score declined by 4.2 points in the bulking agent group compared to a decline of 0.8 in the electrical stimulation group (mean difference in decline: 3.4 points; 95% CI, 1.2-5.5). Quality-of life evaluation showed similar results between groups comparing baseline parameters with 12-month follow-up.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS\nThe short follow-up period of 1 year, atypical method of biofeedback, and unmatched baseline in some of the quality-of-life scales between the 2 groups limited this study.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with mild or moderate anal incontinence, the Cleveland Clinic Florida Fecal Incontinence Score significantly improved in the bulking agent with polyacrylate-polyalcohol copolymer group compared with the endoanal electrical stimulation with biofeedback group.

Previous data suggested that nerves from the WLD(S) are relatively resistant to proteolytic degradation. We investigated the time-course of neurofilament degradation in response to addition of the calcium-activated protease m-calpain, comparing nerves from WLD(S) and wild-type mice. During 10 min of in vitro proteolysis, neurofilaments from the WLD(S) were consistently slower to degrade than were neurofilaments from wild-type mice. Direct comparisons were performed on Western blots, with statistically significant differences in neurofilament immunoreactivity at 2, 4, and 6 min of reaction time (p < 0.01). These findings suggest that the mutation leading to the WLD(S) phenotype may affect the proteolytic interaction between calpain and neurofilaments.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo estimate the potential of daily average emergence of Aedes albopictus adult females. Since this species is very close to Aedes aegypti, although it has not been implicated in the spread of dengue in Brazil.\n\n\nMETHODS\nObservations were carried out fortnightly and incessantly in Pedrinhas, in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, between 1996 and 2000. Breeding productivity was measured using the emergence index (E). Two large reservoirs of more than 10 liters of water were used, and their permanent character was assured by replacing water every time its level was low. The other reservoirs were six pots, initially filled out with a liter of distilled water. The water content was constantly replaced after every collection, regardless of rainfall. The associations with climatic factors were calculated using the correlation index of Pearson.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe emergence (E) in the uncovered reservoir was 66.5, much higher than the one found at the covered water tank, which was 12.2. The permanent character of both breeding settings was assured by water replacement when there was a decrease in the water levels. There was no significant association between rainfall and temperature variations. It was observed in some of the six pots an association between rainfall and the emergence index, with a lesser productivity in the months with lower rainfalls. That period, June to November, would be the most propitious time to perform the mechanical removal of the containers.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe differences in productivity of the two permanent reservoirs could be explained, at least in part, to the existence of organic matter that allows larval growth. Regarding the temporary containers, it seems that the best time for cleaning up would be during the dry months. Having organic matter in the water of breeding settings could enable the isolation of these two mosquito populations, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) gene, located on chromosome X, is believed to be implicated in blood pressure regulation. However the few studies that have examined this association have yielded mixed results. The objective of this study was to assess the association between tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 gene with blood pressure and blood pressure change in adolescents.\n\n\nMETHODS\nParticipants in the Nicotine Dependence in Teens (NDIT) cohort study with blood or saliva samples and at least 3 blood pressure measurements over 5 years were included in the analytic sample (n = 555). Linear growth curve models stratified on sex and ethnicity were used to assess the association between four tag SNPs in the ACE2 gene and systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and blood pressure change.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn males of European descent, rs2074192 and rs233575 were significantly associated with SBP and DBP, and rs2158083 was associated with SBP. In French Canadian males, rs233575 and rs2158083 were significantly associated with DBP. Among females of European descent, rs2074192, rs233575, and rs2158083 were significantly associated with change in SBP over 5 years.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis is the first study to assess the association between the ACE2 gene with blood pressure and blood pressure change in a cohort of adolescents. Results indicate that several ACE2 gene SNPs are associated with blood pressure or blood pressure change in persons of European descent. However the therapeutic potential of these SNPs should be explored.",

        "abstract": "The antibody HMB45 is used to diagnose lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a hyperproliferative disorder of lung smooth muscle cells with mutations in both alleles of either TSC1 or TSC2. A subset of these tumor cells expresses the melanoma-associated antigens gp100 and melanoma antigen recognized by T cells (MART-1). To explore the feasibility of targeting tumors in lymphangioleiomyomatosis by melanoma immunotherapy, we therefore assessed melanoma target antigen expression and existing immune infiltration of affected tissue compared with normal lung and melanoma as well as the susceptibility of cultured lymphangioleiomyomatosis cells to melanoma reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vitro. Tumors expressed tyrosinase-related proteins 1 and 2 but not tyrosinase, in addition to gp100 and MART-1, and were densely infiltrated by macrophages, but not dendritic cells or T cell subsets. Although CD8(+) lymphocytes were sparse compared with melanoma, cells cultured from lymphangioleiomyomatosis tissue were susceptible to cytotoxic, gp100 reactive, and major histocompatibility complex class I restricted CD8(+) T cells in functional assays. Responder T cells selectively clustered and secreted interferon-gamma in response to HLA-matched melanocytes and cultured lymphangioleiomyomatosis cells. This reactivity exceeded that based on detectable gp100 expression; thus, tumor cells in lymphangioleiomyomatosis may process melanosomal antigens different from melanocytic cells. Therefore, boosting immune responses to gp100 in lymphangioleiomyomatosis may offer a highly desirable treatment option for this condition.",

        "abstract": "In patients with end-stage left ventricular (LV) heart failure who receive LV assist device (LVAD) implantation, right ventricular (RV) failure represents a possible critical complication that heavily affects morbidity and mortality. Several clinical, laboratory, hemodynamic, and echocardiographic variables have been found to be associated with RV failure occurrence after surgery. Different models and risk scores have been proposed, with poor results. No accordance has ever been reached about RV pre-operative evaluation, and time has come to introduce a standardized systematic protocol for LVAD suitability assessment according to RV function. We analyzed imaging parameters associated with LVAD implantation-related RV failure, in order to identify the minimum number for pre-operative reliable prediction of post-operative RV failure. A few echocardiographic parameters have been identified as the most reliable, or promising, and reproducible tools in this field: free-wall RV longitudinal strain, RV fractional area change, RV sphericity index, and RV ejection fraction with 3D-echocardiography. We propose the Systematic LVAD Implant Eligibility with Non-invasive Assessment protocol-the SIENA protocol-as a new and simple way of pre-operative evaluation of patients candidates to LVAD implantation.",

        "abstract": "Simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPK) recipients have longer survival compared to type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) cadaveric kidney recipients. However, DM1 living-related kidney transplant (KTX-LR) recipients have the same mortality as SPK recipients. It is unknown whether cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors pretransplant are similar between the two groups, SPK and DM1 KTX-LR. We analyzed pretransplant characteristics of SPK recipients (n = 39) and DM1 KTX-LR/living unrelated (LUR) recipients (KTX-LR/LUR, n = 20). In individuals who had multiple transplants, only pretransplant data from the first transplant was used. As all characteristics of KTX-LR/LUR recipients were the same, they were grouped for comparison with SPK. Pretransplant blood pressure (BP), body mass index, (BMI), hemoglobin A1c (A1c), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), triglycerides (TG), serum creatinine, type and duration of dialysis, and duration of diabetes were compared between the two groups. Mean age at time of transplantation was 41 +/- 1 years (mean +/- SEM) for SPK versus 39 +/- 2 years for KTX-LR/LUR (P = NS). Pretransplant BP, BMI, duration of diabetes, TC, HDL, LDL, TG, and lipid agent use were not different between the groups. Pretransplant A1c was 7.8 +/- 0.3% for SPK recipients and 8.3 +/- 0.5% for KTX-LR/LUR recipients (P = NS). Pretransplant serum creatinine was higher in KTX-LR/LUR compared to SPK (7.9 +/- 0.6 mg/dL versus 5.4 +/- 0.5 mg/dL; P =.01). Except for serum creatinine, there were no significant differences in traditional CVD risk factors pretransplant. However, factors posttransplant in addition to better glucose control with SPK may still be different between SPK and KTX-LR/LUR groups.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nOlder adults worldwide are at a greater risk of suicide than other age groups. There is a scarcity of prospective studies exploring risk factors for suicide in older people and their discriminative ability to identify future suicide.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe examined a prospective cohort of senior Taipei City residents between 2005 and 2009 (N=101,764). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to determine significant risk factors and to construct a predictive score. The accuracy of the derived score in the prediction was tested by Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMale sex (Hazard Ratio [HR]=3.41, p<0.001), lower education (HR=3.31, p<0.001) and lower income (HR=2.52, p=0.01) were associated with an increased risk of suicide, as well as depressed mood (HR=1.44, p=0.02; per unit increase in a 4-point scale) and insomnia (HR=1.30, p=0.03; per unit increase in a 4-point scale). The derived prediction score yielded a sensitivity of 0.63 a specificity of 0.73 and an area under curve of 0.73. Removing depressed mood from the prediction model did not significantly alter suicide predictability (P=0.11).\n\n\nLIMITATIONS\nThe dataset examined did not contain information regarding to important risk factors such as substance misuse and prescribed medications and the measures of mental health were relatively limited.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPrediction of suicide based on factors recorded in a routine health screen of elderly people was unsatisfactory; the strongest predictors were factors that cannot be easily altered. Further understanding of how the socioeconomic condition of seniors contributes to suicide may provide valuable insights for intervention targeting this growing population-at-risk.",

This study was performed to assess whether co-transfection of the p16(INK4a) and p53 genes could inhibit K562 cell proliferation.\n\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS\np16(INK4a) and p53 genes were co-transfected into K562 cells with liposome, and the expression of the transfected genes was detected by Western-immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. The effect of the p16(INK4a) and p53 transfected cell culture was quantified by trypan blue staining, and the number of recovered viable cells was assessed every day after transfection. Cells were analyzed for expression of annexin V in order to detect apoptosis. Differentiation of transfected K562 cells was measured by the benzidine oxidation test, and the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter co-transfection, there were 23% and 28% p53 and p16(INK4a) positive cells respectively. Co-transfection with p16(INK4a) and p53 genes significantly inhibited cell proliferation when compared to transfection with either p16(INK4a) or p53 gene. The percentage of cells expressing the apoptosis-related cell surface antigen annexin V was significantly higher in p53 and p16(INK4a) transfected cells than in p53 or p16(INK4a) transfected cells (6.24+/-0.37% vs 4.88+/- 0.17%, p<0.05 and vs 2.78+/-0.26%, p<0.05, respectively). p16(INK4a) and p53 co-transfection significantly increased the number of cells in G1 phase and decreased that in S phase.\n\n\nINTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS\nExpression of wild-type p16(INK4a) and p53 genes in K562 cells results in reduced proliferation and apoptosis. Introduction of exogenous p16(INK4a) and p53 genes into K562 cells might contribute to the clinical treatment of leukemia.",

Furthermore, our group has determined a correlation between delayed wound healing and elevations in inflammatory mediators in combat casualties. Therefore, we sought to determine the effect of blood transfusion on wound healing and inflammatory mediator release in combat casualties.\n\n\nMETHODS\nProspective data were collected on 20 severely injured combat casualties sustaining extremity wounds. Patients were admitted to the National Naval Medical Center during a 13-month period from January 2007 to January 2008. Data variables included age, gender, Glasgow coma score (GCS), mechanism of injury, and transfusion history. Injury severity was assessed using the Injury Severity Score (ISS). Serum was collected initially and before each surgical wound debridement and analyzed using a panel of 21 cytokines and chemokines. The association between blood transfusion and wound healing, incidence of perioperative infection, intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate, and ICU and hospital length of stay was assessed. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe study cohort had a mean age of 22 +/- 1, a mean ISS of 15.8 +/- 2.6, and a mean GCS 13.9 +/- 0.6; all were men and suffered penetrating injuries (90% improvised explosive device [IED] and 10% gunshot wound [GSW]). The cohort was divided into two groups. Patients receiving <or=4 units of blood initially (group 1, n = 11) were compared with patients who received >4 units of blood initially (group 2, n = 9). There was no significant difference in age, ISS, GCS, or mortality between the two groups. However, group 2 patients had significant impairment in wound healing rate (54% vs. 9%, p < 0.05), higher ICU admission rate (78% vs. 9%, p < 0.01), perioperative infection rate (89% vs. 27%, p < 0.01), and a longer hospital length of stay (49.9 +/- 12.8 vs. 23.8 +/- 2.9, p < 0.05) compared with group 1 patients. In addition, there was a significant correlation between the initial mean serum cytokine/chemokine level of interleukin (IL)-10, IL-8, interferon inducible protein (IP)-10, IL-6, and IL-12p40 and the number of units of blood transfused (p < 0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAllogeneic blood transfusions in combat casualties were associated with impaired wound healing, increased perioperative infection rate, and resource utilization. In addition, the extent of blood transfusion was associated with significant differences in inflammatory chemokine and cytokine release.",

        "abstract": "AIMS\nTo evaluate the utility of umbilical pyloromyotomy for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) compared to published series promoting laparoscopy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEighty-six babies with IHPS had pyloromyotomy using an umbilical skin fold incision. Operating times, post-operative hospital stay and cosmetic appearance of the umbilical wound were studied. Data extracted from recent series promoting laparoscopy were identified using a MEDLINE search strategy and used for comparative analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean operating time for umbilical pyloromyotomy was 30 min (range 15-50 min). All patients went home at an average period of 58 h (range 48-72 h) following surgery. The umbilical scar was barely visible in the post-operative period. Laparoscopic pyloromyotomy operating times ranging from 18-41 min (mean overall 30 min) are recorded in the literature. Post-operative stay following laparoscopy has been variable (23-91 h), where reported. In contrast with umbilical pyloromyotomy, \"pox\" marks observed following port insertions for laparoscopy can give an unsightly scar.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study has found that umbilical pyloromyotomy can be performed with minimal morbidity and equivalent operating times to laparoscopy. The shorter hospital stay reported in some series promoting laparoscopy must be balanced against local practice influencing hospital stay, the financial implications of offering a laparoscopic service, the skills needed for laparoscopy, and the short learning curve required by paediatric surgical trainees to become proficient at umbilical pyloromyotomy. The cosmesis of the umbilical incision is excellent. These findings suggest that umbilical pyloromyotomy is a reliable alternative to laparoscopy.",

        "abstract": "STUDY DESIGN\nImmunohistochemical assessment of apoptotic markers in human cases of compressive myelopathy due to neoplastic compression.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo characterize the role of apoptosis in neoplastic compressive myelopathy in human postmortem tissue with extramedullary tumor involvement.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA\nNeoplasms, whether primary or metastatic, may lead to compression of the spinal cord and development of a compressive myelopathy syndrome. Apoptotic processes of cell death are thought to contribute to cell death in chronic compressive myelopathy because of degenerative spondylosis, but this has not previously been described in neoplastic compression.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSix postmortem cases of human neoplastic compressive myelopathy were assessed for apoptosis using a panel of immunohistochemical markers including Fas, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), caspase-3 and 9, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL).\n\n\nRESULTS\nApoptosis was maximal at the site of tumor compression. Glial cells, predominantly oligodendrocytes, were immunopositive for DNA-PKcs, PARP, AIF, and TUNEL. Axons were immunopositive for caspase 3, DNA-PKcs, and AIF. Neurons were immunopositive for DNA-PKcs, PARP, AIF, and TUNEL.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe current study demonstrates that apoptosis plays a role in human neoplastic compressive myelopathy. Necrosis dominates the severe end of the spectrum of compression. The prominent oligodendroglial involvement is suggestive that apoptosis may be important in the ongoing remodeling of white matter due to sustained compression.\n\n\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE\n4.",

        "abstract": "Modifying the polymeric carbon nitride (CN) with organic molecules is a promising strategy to enhance the photocatalytic activity. However, most previously reported works show that interchain embedding and edge grafting of the organic molecule can hardly be achieved simultaneously. Herein, we successfully synthesized organic molecule bifunctionalized CN (MBCN) through copolymerization of melon and sulfanilamide at a purposely elevated temperature of 550 °C. In MBCN, the edge grafted and interchain embedded benzene rings act as the electron-donating group and charge-transfer channel, respectively, rendering efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production. The optimal MBCN exhibits a significantly improved non-sacrificial photocatalytic H2O2 generation rate (54.0 μmol g-1 h-1) from pure water, which is 10.4 times that of pristine CN. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results reveal that the enhanced H2O2 production activity of MBCN is mainly attributed to the improved photogenerated charge separation/transfer and decreased formation energy barrier (∆G) from ·O2- to the intermediate 1,4-endoperoxide (·OOH). This work suggests that simultaneous formation of electron donating group and charge transfer channel via organic molecule bifunctionalization is a feasible strategy for boosting the photocatalytic activity of CN.",

It is, however, limited by an exclusive focus on knowledge acquired through clinical practice, and a consequent neglect of the primordial and socio-cultural significance of embodied selfhood, precisely what provides the foundational structure of tacit knowledge of caring and facilitates its manifestation. Drawing on findings from a qualitative study of 43 dementia care practitioners in Ontario, Canada that utilised research-based drama and focus group methodology, we argue that embodied selfhood is fundamental to tacit knowledge of caring. Results are analysed drawing upon the theoretical precepts of embodied selfhood that are rooted in Merleau-Ponty's (1962) reconceptualisation of perception and Bourdieu's (1977, 1990) notion of habitus. We conclude with a call for further exploration of the body as a site of the production of tacit knowledge.",

In addition, the study aimed to examine farmers' perceptions of these lesions. Seventy-seven farms were visited; both hocks on a random sample of approximately 50 cows were scored on a categorical scale for hair loss, ulceration and swelling. In addition, the size and location of lesions were marked on a hock map. A questionnaire designed to explore attitudes towards lesions was conducted with the owner. Hair loss and ulceration were seen at five locations. Hair loss was identified on 5,619 of 6,896 hocks (mild: 43.7 per cent; moderate: 25.1 per cent; severe: 12.6 per cent) and 1,137 of 6,896 hocks had areas of ulceration (mild: 8.6 per cent; moderate: 5.8 per cent; severe: 2.1 per cent). The majority of lesions were small; however, a small proportion had extensive areas of hair loss (maximum size 113.3 cm2) and ulceration (maximum size 95.5 cm2). Moderate swelling was recorded on 20 per cent of hocks, and 2.0 per cent had severe swelling. Interview results suggested that more than 90 per cent of participants were aware of hock lesions and a third had sought treatment for them; most felt that lesions had at least some impact on productivity and welfare.",

Neuropsychological memory tests also were performed on these patients. Twenty-eight neurological patients with peripheral nervous lesions and without endocrine dysfunctions served as controls for prolactin levels. Patients with central cerebral atrophy had significant loss of recall capacity, though they did not differ significantly from the normal population in their intellectual performances. CSF and serum prolactin levels in the patients with central cerebral atrophy and/or memory defects did not differ from the values obtained in the patients without cerebral atrophy. Thus, prolactin levels do not appear to reflect either central cerebral atrophy or memory dysfunctions, most likely due to the minor degree of neuronal atrophy around the third ventricle that occurs in patients with these findings.",

A foot examination assessed presence of disorders and pain on each foot. Body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was categorized as normal (<25), overweight (25-29.99), moderate-obesity (30-34.99) severe-obesity (35+). Foot posture (normal, cavus, planus) and dynamic foot function (normal, supinated, pronated) were defined using plantar pressure measurement system. We used sex-specific logistic regression with generalized estimating equations to account for correlation between two feet of the same person, adjusted for age and stratified by foot posture and dynamic foot function.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAverage age was 68±11 years, 56% female, average BMI 28±5kg/m2. 18% of feet had pain, 25% hallux valgus, 2% claw toes, 18% hammer toes, 7% overlapping toes. In men, severe-obesity was associated with foot pain (OR=2.4, p=0.002) and claw toes (OR=3.4, p=0.04). In women, overweight, moderate-obesity and severe-obesity were associated with foot pain. Women with severe-obesity were less likely to have hallux valgus. Similar patterns were evident after stratification by foot posture and dynamic foot function.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBoth men and women were at increased odds of foot pain as BMI increased. Data suggested foot posture and dynamic foot function had no effect, thus are unlikely mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "This report describes the use of Bayesian methods to analyze polyprotein coding region sequences (n = 217) obtained from GenBank to define the genome-wide phylogeny of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV). The results strongly supported the monophyly of five FMDV serotypes, O, A, Asia 1, C, and SAT 3, while sequences for the two remaining FMDV serotypes, SAT 1 and SAT 2 did not separate into entirely distinct clades. The phylogenomic tree revealed three sister-group relationships, serotype O + Asia 1, A + C, and SAT 1 + 3 + 2, with a new branching pattern: {[(O, Asia 1), (A, C)], (SAT 1, 2, 3)}. Within each serotype, there was no apparent periodic, geographic, or host species influence on the evolution of global FMDVs. Analysis of the polyprotein coding region of these sequences provided evidence for the influence of purifying selection on the evolution of FMDV. Using a Bayesian coalescent approach, the evolutionary rate of FMDV isolates that circulated during the years 1932-2007 was estimated to be 1.46 × 10(-3) substitutions/site/year, and the most recent common ancestor of the virus existed approximately 481 years ago. Bayesian skyline plot revealed a population expansion in the early 20(th) century that was followed by a rapid decline in population size from the late 20(th) century to the present day. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms that impact on the evolution of this important livestock pathogen.",

However, the contribution of high-frequency cortical ripples to consolidation is still unclear. We used continuous recordings in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) over the course of spatial learning and show that independent PFC ripples, when dissociated from SWRs, predominantly suppress hippocampal activity in non-REM sleep. PFC ripples paradoxically mediate top-down suppression of hippocampal reactivation, which is inversely related to reactivation strength during coordinated CA1-PFC ripples. Further, we show non-canonical, serial coordination of ripples with cortical slow and spindle oscillations. These results establish a role for cortical ripples in regulating consolidation.",

        "abstract": "This study observed the effects of oxygen supplementation, via an oxygen concentrator, on peripheral arterial blood oxygenation (SpO2) measured by pulse oximetry in anaesthetised cats undergoing spay in three different surgical positions. A total of 192 female feral cats were investigated for a large-scale trap-neuter-release program. Cats were anaesthetised with an intramuscular combination of butorphanol (0,4 mg / kg), ketamine (7-10 mg / kg) and medetomidine (0,03-0,05 mg / kg). Cats were randomly allocated to undergo spay in either Trendelenburg (TR) (70 degrees  downward head tilt), lateral (LR) or dorsal (DR) recumbency. Cats were breathing spontaneously either room air or 2 L/minute oxygen via a tight-fitting face mask. Pulse rate (in beats per minute), respiratory rate (in breaths per minute) and SpO2 (in percentage) were measured at baseline in left lateral recumbency and afterwards continuously after being positioned in allocated surgical position. At the end of surgery, cats were placed again in left recumbency, and all parameters were re-evaluated after five minutes. Overall, 33 % of cats showed severe arterial oxygen desaturation (SpO2 < 90 %) at baseline when breathing room air. When oxygen was supplemented during the procedure, arterial oxygen desaturation resolved in all cats. At the end of the procedure, 29 % of cats were hypoxaemic when oxygen was not supplemented, with an overall higher percentage of hypoxaemic cats in TR as compared to DR and LR recumbencies. All cats recovered well from surgery and were released within 24 hours post-anaesthesia. Arterial oxygen desaturation is frequent in cats anaesthetised with injectable anaesthesia for spay under field conditions. Oxygen supplementation administered via a tight-fitting mask resolved arterial oxygen desaturation in this feral cat population regardless of the surgical position and therefore oxygen supplementation is recommended in any case.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The Society of Critical Care Medicine last published an intensivist definition in 1992. Subsequently, there have been many publications relating to intensivists. Our purpose is to assess how contemporary studies define intensivist physicians. DESIGN: Systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science (2010-2020) for publication titles with the terms intensivist, and critical care or intensive care physician, specialist, or consultant. We included studies focusing on adult U.S. intensivists and excluded non-data-driven reports, non-U.S. publications, and pediatric or neonatal ICU reports. We aggregated the study title intensivist nomenclatures and parsed Introduction and Method sections to discern the text used to define intensivists. Fourteen parameters were found and grouped into five definitional categories: A) No definition, B) Background training and certification, C) Works in ICU, D) Staffing, and E) Database related. Each study was re-evaluated against these parameters and grouped into three definitional classes (single, multiple, or no definition). The prevalence of each parameter is compared between groups using Fisher exact test. SETTING: U.S. adult ICUs and databases. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 657 studies, 105 (16%) met inclusion criteria. Within the study titles, 17 phrases were used to describe an intensivist; these were categorized as intensivist in 61 titles (58%), specialty intensivist in 30 titles (29%), and ICU/critical care physician in 14 titles (13%). Thirty-one studies (30%) used a single parameter (B-E) as their definition, 63 studies (60%) used more than one parameter (B-E) as their definition, and 11 studies (10%) had no definition (A). The most common parameter \"Works in ICU\" (C) in 52 studies (50%) was more likely to be used in conjunction with other parameters rather than as a standalone parameter (multiple parameters vs single-parameter studies; 73% vs 17%; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: There was no consistency of intensivist nomenclature or definitions in contemporary adult intensivist studies in the United States.",

        "title": "Health Communication and Behavioral Change During the COVID-19 Pandemic.",
        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic challenged the public health system to respond to an emerging, difficult-to-understand pathogen through demanding behaviors, including staying at home, masking for long periods, and vaccinating multiple times. We discuss key challenges of the pandemic health communication efforts deployed in the United States from 2020 to 2022 and identify research priorities. One priority is communicating about uncertainty in ways that prepare the public for disagreement and likely changes in recommendations as scientific understanding advances: How can changes in understanding and recommendations foster a sense that \"science works as intended\" rather than \"the experts are clueless\" and prevent creating a void to be filled by misinformation? A second priority concerns creating a culturally fluent framework for asking people to engage in difficult and novel actions: How can health messages foster the perception that difficulties of behavior change signal that the change is important rather than that the change \"is not for people like me?\" A third priority entails a shift from communication strategies that focus on knowledge and attitudes to interventions that focus on norms, policy, communication about policy, and channel factors that impair behavior change: How can we move beyond educating and correcting misinformation to achieving desired actions?",

        "title": "BRCA1/BARD1 ubiquitinates PCNA in unperturbed conditions to promote continuous DNA synthesis.",
        "abstract": "Deficiencies in the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene are the main cause of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA1 is involved in the Homologous Recombination DNA repair pathway and, together with BARD1, forms a heterodimer with ubiquitin E3 activity. The relevance of the BRCA1/BARD1 ubiquitin E3 activity for tumor suppression and DNA repair remains controversial. Here, we observe that the BRCA1/BARD1 ubiquitin E3 activity is not required for Homologous Recombination or resistance to Olaparib. Using TULIP2 methodology, which enables the direct identification of E3-specific ubiquitination substrates, we identify substrates for BRCA1/BARD1. We find that PCNA is ubiquitinated by BRCA1/BARD1 in unperturbed conditions independently of RAD18. PCNA ubiquitination by BRCA1/BARD1 avoids the formation of ssDNA gaps during DNA replication and promotes continuous DNA synthesis. These results provide additional insight about the importance of BRCA1/BARD1 E3 activity in Homologous Recombination.",

        "title": "Impact of Missense Mutations on Spike Protein Stability and Binding Affinity in the Omicron Variant.",
        "abstract": "The global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic faces ongoing uncertainty with the emergence of Variants of Concern featuring numerous mutations on the Spike (S) protein. In particular, the Omicron Variant is distinguished by 32 mutations, including 10 within its receptor-binding domain (RBD). These mutations significantly impact viral infectivity and the efficacy of vaccines and antibodies currently in use for therapeutic purposes. In our study, we employed structure-based computational saturation mutagenesis approaches to predict the effects of Omicron missense mutations on RBD stability and binding affinity, comparing them to the original Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. Our results predict that mutations such as G431W and P507W induce the most substantial destabilizations in the Wuhan-Hu-1-S/Omicron-S RBD. Notably, we postulate that mutations in the Omicron-S exhibit a higher percentage of enhancing binding affinity compared to Wuhan-S. We found that the mutations at residue positions G447, Y449, F456, F486, and S496 led to significant changes in binding affinity. In summary, our findings may shed light on the widespread prevalence of Omicron mutations in human populations. The Omicron mutations that potentially enhance their affinity for human receptors may facilitate increased viral binding and internalization in infected cells, thereby enhancing infectivity. This informs the development of new neutralizing antibodies capable of targeting Omicron's immune-evading mutations, potentially aiding in the ongoing battle against the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "title": "Blood and urine biomarkers for the diagnosis of early stages of knee osteoarthritis: A systematic review.",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To identify biomarkers in human blood or urine at an early stage of knee osteoarthritis (OA) and to elucidate if any can accurately differentiate between healthy controls and early knee OA patients and be considered as a candidate for widespread clinical use for early diagnosis of the disease. METHODS: Medline, Embase and Web of Science were screened to identify comparative studies measuring differences in blood or urine biomarkers between healthy controls and knee OA patients at an early stage (grade 1 or 2 Kellgren-Laurence). Two independent reviewers screened the abstracts for eligibility, reviewed the full texts, assessed the methodological quality and extracted the data. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool for diagnostic test accuracy studies was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Due to relevant heterogeneity, meta-analysis was not appropriate. RESULTS: Five studies met the eligibility criteria. The examined biomarkers were adropin, collagen type II metabolite, C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type II collagen, C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, matrix metalloproteinase 3, N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type IIA, type I procollagen N-terminal propeptides, N-terminal osteocalcin, angiopoietin-2, follistatin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, hepatocyte growth factor, interleukin-8, leptin, platelet-derived growth factor-BB, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, vascular endothelial growth factor and calprotectin and totalling 19 biomarkers. All of the biomarkers were studied only once in the selected papers. CONCLUSIONS: There is no reliable biomarker available to differentiate between early knee OA in patients and healthy controls, but a potential role of a cluster of biomarkers to close this gap. There are several limitations, including inappropriate study designs, small sample sizes, nonconsecutive patient groups and inadequate statistical methods for evaluating biomarker performance in studies included.

        "title": "Quality and stability studies of red blood cell concentrates from umbilical cord blood compared to their adult counterparts.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prematurity is a significant health issue due to its incidence and associated complications. Anemia is common in extremely preterm infants (EPI) and often requires transfusions. Red blood cells (RBC) from adult blood (AB) donors have been linked to oxygen-related complications in EPI, leading to the exploration of cord blood (CB) as an alternative source. However, standardization of CB-RBC manufacturing and comparison with AB-RBC characteristics are necessary before clinical studies can be conducted. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study investigated the quality and characteristics of leukoreduced, gamma-irradiated CB-RBC obtained using a commercial closed system from CB donations not meeting hematopoietic transplantation criteria. CB-RBC units were compared with AB-RBC units, both stored in saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol (SAGM). Various parameters, including hematological and biochemical characteristics, pH, 2,3-DPG levels, blood gases and potential toxicants, were evaluated during storage. RESULTS: CB-RBC units had acceptable initial quality parameters and a hematocrit (55+/-2%) comparable to AB-RBC. The main finding during storage was a faster rise in hemolysis compared to AB-RBC. Potassium (K+) significantly increased during storage in both sources. As expected, glucose levels decreased, and conversely, lactate levels increased, indicating similar patterns of anaerobic glycolysis during storage. pH decreased, affecting the oxygen dissociation curve due to reduced 2,3-DPG levels. After irradiation at 14 days of storage, CB-RBC were less stable as hemolysis and K+ significantly increased compared to AB-RBC at 24 hours. Phthalate concentrations, indicative of plasticizers, increased during storage, but significantly less in CB compared to AB-RBC. Most metals measured were within acceptable ranges. DISCUSSION: The quality of CB-RBC during storage is primarily influenced by levels of hemolysis and extracellular K+ content. Based on the analyzed parameters, we suggest that the expiration date for CB-RBC stored with SAGM should be set at 14 days, with transfusion occurring within <24 hours after irradiation.",
