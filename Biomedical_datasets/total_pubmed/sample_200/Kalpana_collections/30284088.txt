The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in tissue engineering has been extensively investigated.
The greater the proliferation of this cellular group, the greater the regenerative and healing capacity of the tissue to which they belong.
In this context, photobiomodulation (PBM) is an efficient technique in proliferation of distinct cell types.
However, its parameters and mode of action are still unclear and require further investigation.
This study aimed to evaluate the PBM action with different energies in MSCs of adipose tissue (hASCs).
We used hASCs, seeded in 24-well plates, with 3 × 104 cells per well, in culture media.
We used a total of four experimental groups, one with hASCs and simulated PBM and three other groups, which received PBM irradiation at 24, 48, and 72 h, with a 660-nm laser and power of 40 mW and energy of 0.56, 1.96, and 5.04 J. We performed analyses of MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromidefor) and trypan blue to evaluate cell proliferation and viability, 1 h after PBM irradiation.
Software Graph PadPrism 7.0 was used.
Intergroup comparisons were performed with ANOVA two-way and we used the Tukey post hoc test.
Mitochondrial activity evaluated by MTT revealed the statistical difference in the first 24 h for group with more high energy when compared to control group; and in the 72 h for two irradiated groups when compared to the control group.
The trypan blue test showed significant differences at the end of the experiment for two irradiated groups LG1 (4.52 × 104 ± 0.2) and LG2 (4.85 × 104 ± 0.8), when compared to the control group (1.87 × 104 ± 0.7).
Both tests failed to be statistically different at the end of the experiment for groups LG1 and LG2 and observed a reduction in cellular mitochondrial growth and activity for group LG3.
We conclude that PBM with energy close to 0.56 and 1.96 J promote proliferation of hASCs, and higher energy, such as 5.04 J, can be harmful.
