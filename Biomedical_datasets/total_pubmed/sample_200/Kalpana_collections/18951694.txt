Organotin compounds and their degradation products enter the environment mainly as a result of their use as biocides and antifouling paints.
Analysis of these compounds in environmental samples has to be very sensitive and selective so that their concentrations corresponding to the low environmental target values can also be detected.
Generally, analysis of a complex matrix leads to high interferences during the different process steps; clean-up procedures are recommended to overcome this problem.
For the past many years, solid phase extraction by employing imprinted materials has been extensively used for many organic substances that are used for pre-concentration and clean-up purposes with excellent results.
Here, we present three different imprinted polymers prepared via bulk, precipitation, and emulsion polymerization methods that use similar compositions.
The synthesized polymer particles were characterized morphologically by employing scanning electron microscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis.
Binding properties were calculated using the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm.
Depending on the properties of the materials, different analytical applications for complex matrices are proposed.
These applications are mainly used on tributyltin and its degradation products for environmental analysis.
