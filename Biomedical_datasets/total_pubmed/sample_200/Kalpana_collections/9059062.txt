To clarify the efficacy of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for adult ALL in first remission we retrospectively studied long-term outcomes of adult ALL patients of age between 15 and 44 years who were treated in our institute from 1980 to 1990.
In this period thirteen patients with HLA compatible donors were offered allogeneic BMT during the first remission, while 16 patients without HLA-compatible donor were treated with maintenance chemotherapy (Cancer Chemoth Pharmacology 33:359-365, 1994).
Patient and disease characteristics (age, leukocyte count at presentation, immunophenotype, Ph1 chromosome, and duration to first remission) in the two groups were not significantly different (chi-square test p > 0.1).
As causes of treatment failure, relapse was 90% for chemotherapy while relapse and therapy-related death were 67% and 33%, respectively, for transplantation.
The leukemia-free survival (LFS) rates at 10 years were 52 +/- 13% for transplantation and 30 +/- 11% for chemotherapy (P > 0.2, g-Wilcoxon, Logrank).
The 10-year-LFS rates of Ph1-negative patients of 15 to 29 year-old were 67 +/- 15% for transplantation (n = 9) and 62 +/- 15% for chemotherapy (n = 8) (P > 0.9).
Although the present data are derived from a non randomized retrospective study and a relatively small number of patients, this study revealed no superiority of BMT over chemotherapy for the prolongation of first remission in adult ALL, especially, in a standard risk group such as young patients without Ph1 chromosome.
