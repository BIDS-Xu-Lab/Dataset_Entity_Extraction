Simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPK) recipients have longer survival compared to type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) cadaveric kidney recipients.
However, DM1 living-related kidney transplant (KTX-LR) recipients have the same mortality as SPK recipients.
It is unknown whether cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors pretransplant are similar between the two groups, SPK and DM1 KTX-LR.
We analyzed pretransplant characteristics of SPK recipients (n = 39) and DM1 KTX-LR/living unrelated (LUR) recipients (KTX-LR/LUR, n = 20).
In individuals who had multiple transplants, only pretransplant data from the first transplant was used.
As all characteristics of KTX-LR/LUR recipients were the same, they were grouped for comparison with SPK.
Pretransplant blood pressure (BP), body mass index, (BMI), hemoglobin A1c (A1c), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), triglycerides (TG), serum creatinine, type and duration of dialysis, and duration of diabetes were compared between the two groups.
Mean age at time of transplantation was 41 +/- 1 years (mean +/- SEM) for SPK versus 39 +/- 2 years for KTX-LR/LUR (P = NS).
Pretransplant BP, BMI, duration of diabetes, TC, HDL, LDL, TG, and lipid agent use were not different between the groups.
Pretransplant A1c was 7.8 +/- 0.3% for SPK recipients and 8.3 +/- 0.5% for KTX-LR/LUR recipients (P = NS).
Pretransplant serum creatinine was higher in KTX-LR/LUR compared to SPK (7.9 +/- 0.6 mg/dL versus 5.4 +/- 0.5 mg/dL; P =.01).
Except for serum creatinine, there were no significant differences in traditional CVD risk factors pretransplant.
However, factors posttransplant in addition to better glucose control with SPK may still be different between SPK and KTX-LR/LUR groups.
