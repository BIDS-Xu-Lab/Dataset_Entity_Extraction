The Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) gene, located on chromosome X, is believed to be implicated in blood pressure regulation.
However the few studies that have examined this association have yielded mixed results.
The objective of this study was to assess the association between tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 gene with blood pressure and blood pressure change in adolescents.
Participants in the Nicotine Dependence in Teens (NDIT) cohort study with blood or saliva samples and at least 3 blood pressure measurements over 5 years were included in the analytic sample (n = 555).
Linear growth curve models stratified on sex and ethnicity were used to assess the association between four tag SNPs in the ACE2 gene and systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and blood pressure change.
In males of European descent, rs2074192 and rs233575 were significantly associated with SBP and DBP, and rs2158083 was associated with SBP.
In French Canadian males, rs233575 and rs2158083 were significantly associated with DBP.
Among females of European descent, rs2074192, rs233575, and rs2158083 were significantly associated with change in SBP over 5 years.
This is the first study to assess the association between the ACE2 gene with blood pressure and blood pressure change in a cohort of adolescents.
Results indicate that several ACE2 gene SNPs are associated with blood pressure or blood pressure change in persons of European descent.
However the therapeutic potential of these SNPs should be explored.
