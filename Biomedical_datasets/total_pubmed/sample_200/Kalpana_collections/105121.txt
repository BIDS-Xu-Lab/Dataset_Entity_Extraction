Anterior segment ischemia changes can occur without detachment of any muscles.
The most common cause of such ischemic changes of the anterior segment is the removal of too many rectus muscles in one operation.
Twenty dog eyes and eight monkey eyes were subjected to the disinsertion and detachment of various combinations of extraocular muscles.
They were sacrificed at intervals from 30 to 90 days.
During the observation period, they were observed for gross and slit lamp changes.
The enucleated eyes were studied microscopically for signs of ischemic and necrotic changes.
Two patients who were studied, observed, and treated for anterior segment ischemia following muscle surgery are described.
The changes which occur after muscle surgery are extensive and include corneal edema, cataract, chemosis, corneal changes, decreases in intraocular pressure, decreases in outflow or glaucoma and frank necrosis.
The variables which lead to this reaction is described in detail.
Also, some unanswered queries, such as the duration of the reaction and the time interval of the reaction after multiple muscle surgeries, are discussed.
