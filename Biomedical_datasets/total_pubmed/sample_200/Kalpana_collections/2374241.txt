The North American opossum Didelphis virginiana was used as a model for fetal urinary obstruction.
In this animal the fetus develops on a teat in a pouch and, therefore, it is accessible to surgical intervention.
Unilateral ureteral obstruction was created at a mid trimester developmental equivalent in 8 pups, late ureteral obstruction was created in a similar fashion in 6 pups at a full-term equivalent and unobstruction of 9 pups was accomplished with a ureteroneocystostomy at a full-term equivalent.
After early intervention 6 pups were found to have only partial ureteral obstruction as measured by mild dilatation and probe patency of the ureter.
The control group consisted of 11 unoperated animals.
The animals were maintained until adulthood when they were harvested after obtaining creatinine clearances from both kidneys.
All dilated urinary systems were cultured for bacteria and they were sterile.
