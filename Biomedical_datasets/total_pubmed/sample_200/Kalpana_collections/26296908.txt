The main objective of this study was to describe geriatric recommendations based on a geriatric assessment (GA) and to evaluate the implementation of these recommendations.
A two-step approach of screening followed by a GA was implemented in nine hospitals in Belgium.
Patients â‰¥ 70 years were included at diagnosis or at disease progression/relapse.
Concrete geriatric recommendations were systematically documented and reported to the treating physicians and consisted of referrals to professional health care workers.
Patient charts were reviewed after one month to verify which geriatric recommendations have been performed.
From August 2011 to July 2012, 1550 patients were included for analysis.
The median age was 77 (range: 70-97) and 57.0% were female.
A solid tumour was diagnosed in 91.4% and a haematological malignancy in 8.6%.
Geriatric screening with the G8 identified 63.6% of the patients for GA (n=986).
A median of two geriatric recommendations (range: 1-6) were given for 76.2% (95%CI: 73.4-78.8) of the evaluable patients (n=710).
A median of one geriatric recommendation (range: 1-5) was performed in 52.1% (95%CI: 48.4-55.8) of the evaluable patients (n=689).
In general, 460 or 35.3% (95%CI: 32.8-38.0) of all the geriatric recommendations were performed.
Geriatric recommendations most frequently consisted of referrals to the dietician (60.4%), social worker (40.3%), and psychologist (28.9%).
This implementation study provides insight into GA-based recommendations/interventions in daily oncology practice.
Geriatric recommendations were given in about three-fourths of patients.
About one-third of all geriatric recommendations were performed in approximately half of these patients.
