Symptomatic carotid disease conveys a high risk of recurrent stroke.
Plaque morphology and specific plaque characteristics are associated with the risk of stroke.
This study aimed to evaluate the detailed plaque features by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and develop a simple scale combining clinical indicators, digital subtraction angiography (DSA), and OCT imaging markers to identify symptomatic carotid plaque.
Methods: Carotid plaques from consecutive patients who underwent carotid OCT imaging between June 2017 and June 2021 were evaluated.
Clinical characteristics, DSA, and OCT data were compared between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups.
Logistic regression was performed to identify the factors associated with symptomatic carotid plaque and to develop a scale.
The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the performance of the scale.
A total of 90 carotid plaques from 90 patients were included (symptomatic 35.6%, asymptomatic 64.4%).
Three main factors were found to be associated with symptomatic carotid plaque: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) <0.925 mmol/L (OR, 4.708; 95% CI, 1.640 to 13.517;
P = 0.004), irregular plaque (OR, 4.017; 95% CI, 1.250 to 12.910; P = 0.020), and white thrombus (OR, 4.594; 95% CI, 1.141 to 18.487; P = 0.032).
The corresponding score of three items produced a scale with good discrimination (AUC, 0.768; 95% CI, 0.665 to 0.871).
The optimal cutoff value of the scale was 1.5 points with 59.4% sensitivity and 84.5% specificity.
Conclusion: The three-item scale comprising HDL-C <0.925 mmol/L, angiographical irregular plaque, and white thrombus detected by OCT may provide information to identify symptomatic carotid plaque.
Further large-scale studies are required to validate whether the symptomatic carotid plaque scale is clinically valuable in recognizing carotid atherosclerosis in the early stages.
