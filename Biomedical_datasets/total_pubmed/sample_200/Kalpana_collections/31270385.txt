Periodic metal-dielectric structures attract substantial interest since it was previously proposed that the spontaneous emission amplification rates (the Purcell factor) in such structures can reach enormous values up to 105.
However, the role of absorption in real metals has not been thoroughly considered.
We provide a theoretical analysis showing that absorption leads to diminishing values of Purcell factor.
We also suggest that using emitting organic compounds such as CBP (4,4-Bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1-biphenyl) can lead to a moderate increase of about an order of magnitude in the Purcell factor.
Defining the experimentally measured Purcell factor as a ratio between the excited state lifetimes in bare CBP and in periodic structure, this increase in the fabricated periodic structure is demonstrated through a 4-8 times decrease in excited state radiative lifetime compared to a bare organic material in a wide emission spectrum.
