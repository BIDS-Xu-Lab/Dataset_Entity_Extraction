The object of this study was to look at, on the one hand, the demands made on the pregnant woman's heart and, on the other hand, the effects on fetal heart rate resulting from moderate exercise with a definite rhythm performed by pregnant women.
Ten primiparous pregnant women who had normal pregnancies took part in this study in the third and eighth months of the pregnancies.
These women were compared with 20 control women who were not pregnant but whose mean age, height and weight were similar to those in the study before their pregnancies started.
The maternal heart rate was monitored continuously and the fetal heart rate was recorded telemetrically when the women were carrying 5 kg in each hand with the arms held upright.
We will discuss the results that were obtained in the 5 women who followed the course from the beginning to the end of the pregnancy for the sake of this study.
The mean heart rate at rest was considerably higher in the pregnant women than in the controls at rest and standing.
The heart rate was much higher during the exercise in the pregnant women than in the controls at rest and standing.
The heart rate was much higher during the exercise in the pregnant women than in the controls.
These changes in heart rate were essentially the same between the 3rd and the 8th month of the pregnancy.
The fetal heart rate did not change significantly during nor after the exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
