This review examines recent studies of the evaluation and treatment of oropharyngeal dysphagia as well as papers investigating oropharyngeal dysphagia and nutritional management.
There continue to be difficulties in accurate diagnosis of some disorders in oropharyngeal swallow, accounting for the patient's dysphagic symptoms and in identifying optimal treatment strategies for each patient.
The efficacy of new techniques for the treatment of oropharyngeal dysphagia have been examined in various populations.
Exercise programs have been showing increased efficacy in particular patient groups.
Articles in this past year have focused largely on identifying new procedures for assessment of oropharyngeal swallowing and defining treatment effects.
Relatively little work has examined nutritional management in patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia.
Most studies that have investigated nutritional management do not carefully define the patient's medical diagnosis or specific swallowing disorders.
Similarly, those that study oropharyngeal dysphagia do not relate these data to nutritional management of these patients.
