The development of a gay or lesbian identity (often referred to as the coming out process) has been widely studied in adults; however, few studies have examined the process in gay adolescents.
Even among these studies, little research has investigated the effects of race or family values on the coming out process.
A small sample of African-American, Hispanic/Latino, Asian/Eurasian, and Caucasian gay male adolescents participated in this survey study.
Coming out was operationalized in three stages: sensitization; awareness with confusion, denial, guilt, and shame; and acceptance.
The majority of respondents reported feeling different from other boys as children.
The average age of first crush on another boy was 12.7 years; average age for realizing they were gay was 12.5 years.
Most respondents reported feeling confused during their first awareness that they were gay.
Denial of identity was a coping strategy for about half the sample.
Traditional family values played a greater role in predicting coming out experiences than did race.
Families were categorized as having high or low traditional values based upon (1) the importance of religion, (2) emphasis on marriage, (3) emphasis on having children, and (4) whether a non-English language was spoken in the home.
Families with a strong emphasis on traditional values were perceived as less accepting of homosexuality than were the low traditional families.
Those who work with adolescents need to be aware that some will recognize their sexual orientation as gay, lesbian, or bisexual during this time of their lives.
These youth need support in the coming out process because they may encounter stigmatization and disapproval not only from the larger society, but also from their families, peers, and sometimes the gay community itself.
