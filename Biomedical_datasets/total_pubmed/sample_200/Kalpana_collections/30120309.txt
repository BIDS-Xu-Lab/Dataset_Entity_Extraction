Hyperuricemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.
However, in very elderly, the relationship between hyperuricemia and the prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is not clear.
This study aimed to investigate hyperuricemia and the risk of AF in community very elderly.
In this cross-sectional study, 1056 very elderly in community were enrolled.
Serum uric acid (SUA) were measured and rest 12-lead electrocardiogram was performed.
Multiple logistic regression models were used to explore risk factors for AF in very elderly.
Finally, 1038 participants were included in analysis and the mean age of the study participants were 83.6 ± 3.4 years (age range 80-100 years).
The mean SUA level was 350.1 ± 84.5 µmol/L.
The estimated prevalence of AF was 5.3%, and there was no significant sex difference (5.8% for men and 4.8% for women, p = 0.401).
Multiple logistic regression found that participants with hyperuricemia (SUA >416 µmol/L in men and >357 µmol/L in women) had a higher risk (odds ratio: 2.080, 95% confidence interval: 1.103-4.202, P = 0.007) of suffering AF in very elderly Chinese.
In conclusion, AF is relatively frequent in this community very elderly Chinese in Chengdu.
Hyperuricemia is associated with the prevalence of AF in general very elderly.
