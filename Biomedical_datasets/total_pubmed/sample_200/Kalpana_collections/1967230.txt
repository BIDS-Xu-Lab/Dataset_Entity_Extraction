The aim of this study has been to define cytotoxic mechanisms that may cause clonal expansion in the liver of pre-carcinogenic cells.
An in vitro model, which has been described previously, was used.
Hepatocytes were isolated from carcinogen-treated rats and a high proportion of the cells were gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT)-positive.
The cells were incubated in suspension and exposed to toxic agents in concentrations that induced a moderate increase in cellular leakage within 3 h. Samples were withdrawn and sampled cells were then allowed to attach to collagen-coated plates.
Attached cells were stained and the ratio of GGT-positive/GGT-negative cells (GGT-ratio) was determined.
The initial GGT-ratio was 10.4 +/- 4.7% and an increased ratio was taken as a sign of toxicity that resulted in a selection of GGT-positive cells.
In a first series of experiments it was shown that hydroquinone and menadione increase the GGT-ratio, while diquat, sodium selenite, diethyl maleate or phorone do not.
However, diethyl maleate in combination with diquat increased the GGT-ratio.
Hydrogen peroxide (5 mM) increased the GGT-ratio as effectively as hydroquinone (0.3 mM).
Lower concentrations of H2O2 (0.05 mM) increased the GGT-ratio in GSH-depleted cells.
The changes induced by hydroquinone and H2O2 in low concentration were reversible.
In another series of experiments, plates coated with antibodies against beta 1-integrin were used.
An increase in the GGT-ratio was obtained with anti beta 1-integrin, but not with broad spectrum anti-rat hepatocyte or anti-rat beta 2-microglobulin antibodies as substrata.
These data suggested an involvement of the beta 1-integrin in the selection.
Taken together, these data indicate that GGT-positive hepatocytes are protected against GSH depletion and oxidative stress that may result in reversible receptor alterations.
