Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are promising candidates for high-energy storage devices due to high theoretical capacities of both the sulfur cathode and lithium (Li) metal anode.
Considerable efforts have been devoted to improving sulfur cathodes.
However, issues associated with Li anodes, such as low Coulombic efficiency (CE) and growth of Li dendrites, remain unsolved due to unstable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) and lead to poor capacity retention and a short cycling life of Li-S batteries.
In this work, we demonstrate a facile and effective approach to fabricate a flexible and robust hybrid SEI layer through co-deposition of aromatic-based organosulfides and inorganic Li salts using poly(sulfur-random-1,3-diisopropenylbenzene) as an additive in an electrolyte.
The aromatic-based organic components with planar backbone conformation and π-π interaction in the SEI layers can improve the toughness and flexibility to promote stable and high efficient Li deposition/dissolution.
The as-formed durable SEI layer can inhibit dendritic Li growth, enhance Li deposition/dissolution CE (99.1% over 420 cycles), and in turn enable Li-S batteries with good cycling stability (1000 cycles) and slow capacity decay.
This work demonstrates a route to address the issues associated with Li metal anodes and promote the development of high-energy rechargeable Li metal batteries.
