Development of new selective ligands for excitatory amino acid receptors has been fundamental in supporting this rapidly developing field.
Some of the most important ligands have come from the laboratories of Jeff Watkins, Povl Krogsgaard-Larsen and Tage Honor√©, who collaborate in this double-length review to describe the chemical features and SARs of agonists and antagonists, particularly those features associated with subtype selectivity.
