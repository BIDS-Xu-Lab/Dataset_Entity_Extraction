﻿Caloric restriction in mice has been found to retard the rate of aging, increase mean and maximum life spans, and inhibit the occurrence of many age-associated diseases.
The following study was conducted to investigate the effect of short-term repeated fasting (4 consecutive days, every 2 weeks) before wound creation on skin wound healing.
Mice were used for macroscopic study (n = 40) and hydroxyproline analysis (n = 10).
Mice were also used for microscopic study (n = 36) and were divided equally into a fasting group and a control group.
The results revealed that there were significant differences in epithelialization, contraction, healing, amount of collagen, and hydroxyproline between the control and fasting groups (P < 0.05).
Based on the results, it can be argued that caloric restriction preceding the wound-healing period has the potential to accelerate the healing process.
