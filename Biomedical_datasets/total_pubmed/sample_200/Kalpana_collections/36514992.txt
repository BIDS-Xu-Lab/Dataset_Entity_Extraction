Paediatric studies have shown serum N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide levels to be a valuable tool in the surveillance of myocardial function and an early biomarker for rejection in transplant patients.
The correlation between low mean right atrial pressure and increased inferior vena cava collapsibility index is well studied in adults.
right atrial pressure in paediatric heart transplant patients).
A single centre, retrospective chart review of the paediatric transplant patients from 0 to 21 years of age was performed between 2015 and 2017.
Thirty-nine patients had complete data which includes cardiac catheterisation, transthoracic echocardiogram, and serum N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide levels done within a two weeks of interval.
A higher inferior vena cava collapsibility index correlated with a lower mean right atrial pressure (r = -0.21, p = 0.04) and a larger inferior vena cava diameter in expiration indexed to body surface area (IVCmax/BSA0.5) correlated with a higher mean right atrial pressure (r = 0.29, p = 0.01).
There was a correlation between elevated N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide and inferior vena cava collapsibility index (r = -0.38, p = 0.0001), IVCmax/BSA0.5 (r = 0.25, p = 0.0002), and mean right atrial pressure (r = 0.6, p = 0.0001).
Serum N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide levels correlated to non-invasive measurements (inferior vena cava collapsibility index and IVCmax/BSA0.5) and to the invasive mean right atrial pressure.
Non-invasive (IVC-CI IVCmax/BSA0.5) correlates with elevated mean right atrial pressure in this population.
Together, these may serve as a reliable surveillance tool in assessing right heart filling pressures and cardiac function within the paediatric heart transplant patient.
