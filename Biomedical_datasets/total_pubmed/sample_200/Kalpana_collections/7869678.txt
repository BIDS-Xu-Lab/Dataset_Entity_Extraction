A number of chemicals may adversely affect one or more of the anatomical structures of the kidney, such as the glomerulus, the tubular apparatus, the medullary, or interstitial cells.
To recognize subclinical renal dysfunction, a battery of new, non-invasive tests was applied in comparison to established ones.
The study on cadmium exposed subjects, performed within the framework of a collaborative European research project, exemplifies the concept of target selectivity within a nephron.
One hundred seventy-two subjects were classified according to urinary cadmium excretion as controls (< 1.5 micrograms/g creatinine), or subjects with moderate or high cadmium body burden (1.5 to 5 micrograms/g creatinine, > 5 micrograms/g creatinine).
Twenty-six urinary analytes (such as serum derived proteins, tubular enzymes, eicosanoids) and four plasma markers, related to the function or integrity of specific nephron segments, were investigated in a cross-sectional study.
The group with the moderate cadmium body burden showed alterations of proximal tubular integrity, that is, increased excretion of tubular brush-border antigens.
The group with higher cadmium body burden revealed an involvement of the whole nephron.
The most prominent quantitative changes were found for the glomerular markers high molecular weight proteins, and thromboxane B2 and for the proximal tubular markers retinol binding protein, alpha 1-microglobulin, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, and the intestinal alkaline phosphatase.
A diagnostic approach to screen for nephrotoxicity due to environmental hazards like cadmium should include proximal tubular markers (alpha 1-microglobulin and tubular enzymes, that is, intestinal alkaline phosphatase) but the measurement of glomerular markers is also advisable.
