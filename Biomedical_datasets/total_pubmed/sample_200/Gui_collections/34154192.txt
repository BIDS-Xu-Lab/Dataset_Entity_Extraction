A bidirectional planar-displacement waveguide tracker was devised to replace the traditional two-axis tracking system for high-concentration photovoltaics, with improved module thickness, optical field uniformity, and current matching.
The concentrating magnification reaches 725 times, and the sun tracking angle is more than 170°, which is equivalent to 11.3 tracking hours per day.
The module thickness is only 6.16 cm.
This design enabled us to place the module flat on the ground, in which swing was not required.
This will greatly improve the mechanical strength and the lifetime of the module and solve the development dilemma faced by III-V multijunction solar cells.
