MANAGEMENT OF SECONDARY LESIONS IN ANO-PERINEAL CROHN'S DISEASE.
Anoperineal involvement in Crohn's disease is common and affects around 1/3 of patients during their disease.
It constitutes a pejorative factor with an increased risk of permanent colostomy and proctectomy and is associated with a major deterioration in quality of life.
Secondary anal lesions in Crohn's disease are fistulas and abscesses.
They are difficult to treat and often recurrent.
A multidisciplinary medico-surgical management in several stages is essential.
The classic sequence is based on a first phase of drainage of fistulas and abscesses, a second phase of medical treatment based primarily on anti-TNF alpha and finally a third phase of surgical closure of the fistula tract(s).
Conventional closure techniques such as biologic glue, plug, advancement flap and intersphincteric ligation of the fistula tract have limited effectiveness, are not always feasible, require technical skills and some have an impact on anal continence.
In recent years, we have witnessed a real enthusiasm generated by the arrival of cell therapy.
This has not spared proctology since adipose-derived allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have had Marketing Authorisation and have been reimbursed in France since 2020 in the treatment of complex anal fistulas in Crohn's disease after failure of at least one biologic therapy.
This new treatment offers an additional alternative in patients often in a situation of therapeutic impasse.
Preliminary results in real life are satisfactory with a good safety profile.
However, it will be necessary to confirm these results in the longer term and to work to determine the profile of the patients who could benefit the most from this expensive therapy.
