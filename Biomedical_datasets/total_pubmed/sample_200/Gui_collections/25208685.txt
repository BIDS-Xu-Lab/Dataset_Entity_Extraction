[25(OH)D3] concentration with pregnancy and birth outcomes.
Four geographical areas of Spain, 2003-2008.
Of 2382 mother-child pairs participating in the INfancia y Medio Ambiente (INMA) Project.
We tested associations of maternal 25(OH)D3 concentration with pregnancy and birth outcomes.
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preterm delivery, caesarean section, fetal growth restriction (FGR) and small-for-gestational age (SGA), anthropometric birth outcomes including weight, length and head circumference (HC).
After adjustment, there was no association between maternal 25(OH)D3 concentration and risk of GDM or preterm delivery.
Women with sufficient vitamin D [25(OH)D3 ≥ 30 ng/ml] had a decreased risk of caesarean section by obstructed labour compared with women with vitamin D deficiency [relative risk (RR) = 0.60, 95% CI 0.37, 0.97).
Offspring of mothers with higher circulating 25(OH)D3 concentration tended to have smaller HC [coefficient (SE) per doubling concentration of 25(OH)D3, -0.10 (0.05), P = 0.038].
No significant associations were found for other birth outcomes.
This study did not find any evidence of an association between vitamin D status in pregnancy and GDM, preterm delivery, FGR, SGA and anthropometric birth outcomes.
Results suggest that sufficient circulating vitamin D concentration [25(OH)D3 ≥ 30 ng/ml] in pregnancy may reduce the risk of caesarean section by obstructed labour.
