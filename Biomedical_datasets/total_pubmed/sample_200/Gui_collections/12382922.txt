Rare earth doped oxide, phosphate, etc. are radioluminescent phosphors that have a broad application in X ray imaging, in luminescent screens, image transformers and in fluorescent lamp manufacturing.
Some of them have interesting thermoluminescence features as well, which makes the phosphors applicable also in dosimetry.
Two of these materials are Sr3(PO4)2 and BaFCl activated with europium.
The general radioluminescence (RL) and thermoluminescence (TL) characteristics of these materials was investigated earlier and the preliminary results have already been published elsewhere.
The aim of the present work is to investigate the interesting properties of these phosphors mainly from a dosimetric point of view (sensitivity, dose dependence, etc.).
