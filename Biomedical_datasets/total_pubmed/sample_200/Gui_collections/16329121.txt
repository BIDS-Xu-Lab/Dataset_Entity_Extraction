Voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels play key roles in the excitability of skeletal muscle fibers.
In this study we investigated the steady-state and kinetic properties of voltage-gated Na+ and K+ currents of slow and fast skeletal muscle fibers in zebrafish ranging in age from 1 day postfertilization (dpf) to 4-6 dpf.
The inner white (fast) fibers possess an A-type inactivating K+ current that increases in peak current density and accelerates its rise and decay times during development.
As the muscle matured, the V50s of activation and inactivation of the A-type current became more depolarized, and then hyperpolarized again in older animals.
The activation kinetics of the delayed outward K+ current in red (slow) fibers accelerated within the first week of development.
The tail currents of the outward K+ currents were too small to allow an accurate determination of the V50s of activation.
Red fibers did not show any evidence of inward Na+ currents; however, white fibers expressed Na+ currents that increased their peak current density, accelerated their inactivation kinetics, and hyperpolarized their V50 of inactivation during development.
The action potentials of white fibers exhibited significant changes in the threshold voltage and the half width.
These findings indicate that there are significant differences in the ionic current profiles between the red and white fibers and that a number of changes occur in the steady-state and kinetic properties of Na+ and K+ currents of developing zebrafish skeletal muscle fibers, with the most dramatic changes occurring around the end of the first day following egg fertilization.
