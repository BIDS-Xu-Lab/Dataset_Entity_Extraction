We report about a patient who underwent double valve replacement with two Starr-Edwards prostheses in aortic and mitral position 30 years ago.
Under anticoagulation medication he survived 28 years without any valve-related events.
In the 29th year he sustained a cerebral infarction from which he recovered, having only a residual left arm paresis.
His NYHA functional class today is II-III.
Chest X-ray shows a mildly enlarged configuration of the heart, echocardiography reveals no irregularities of the implanted prostheses.
We conclude, that the Starr-Edwards valve presents an outstanding standard concerning durability in mechanical valve replacement.
