A new method to measure simultaneously and directly the aorto-femoral pressure-gradient is described.
The study can be performed in connection with translumbar aortography.
In addition of being easy to perform the following advantages can be obtained by using this method: 1.
2. Informations regarding the absolute value of the aortofemoro pressure-gradient at rest and after maximal vasodilatation is obtained.
