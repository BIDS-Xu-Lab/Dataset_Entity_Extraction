The microorganisms in rumen contents were physically separated into five fractions on the basis of size using counter-flow centrifugal elutriation (CCE).
The use of CCE allowed the microbial population to be separated in a highly repeatable manner into two protozoal and three bacterial fractions with minimal loss of material (dry weight), and with no visible damage to the microorganisms.
A Coulter counter was used to determine the sizes of the organisms in each fraction.
The modified CCE method is suitable for studies of the rumen microbial ecosystem that require separation of defined fractions of the population.
