Thirty-one CSF samples from alcoholics and non-alcoholic neurological patients were assayed for immunoreactive motilin and human pancreatic polypeptide (HPP).
Both peptides were detected in all samples.
Alcoholics without liver disease had significantly higher levels of motilin and lower levels of HPP than neurological controls.
