This manuscript describes the first detailed chemical investigation of endemic species Iris adriatica, including isolation and structure elucidation.
Chemical analyses of the rhizome CH2Cl2/MeOH (2:1) extract revealed fourteen secondary metabolites, mainly isoflavonoids.
Among isoflavonoids, two groups have been found: nigricin-type and tectorigenin-type.
Dominant group of the isolated compounds has been nigricin-type isoflavones: nigricin, nigricin-4'-(1-O-β-D-glucopyranoside) and nigricin-4'-(1-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl (1-6)-β-D-glucopyranoside) with 2.5, 10 and 1% of the total extract, respectively.
Irisxanthone - xanthone C-glucoside, β-sitosterol, benzophenone and one of its derivatives have also been found.
Nigricin-type isoflavonoids and irisxanthone can be considered as possible chemotaxonomic markers for I. adriatica.
5,3',5'-Trimethoxy-6,7-methylenedioxyisoflavone-4'-(1-O-β-D-glucopyranoside) and benzophenone have been isolated from Iris species for the first time.
