We describe the visco-shell technique with sodium hyaluronate 2.3% (Healon5) to facilitate phacoemulsification in eyes with Morgagnian cataract.
Because the entire nucleus is wrapped in a Healon5 visco-shell, phacoemulsification can be performed safely without damaging the corneal endothelium and the posterior capsule.
