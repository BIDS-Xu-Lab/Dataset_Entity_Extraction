Passive smoking is an emotive issue and one which has received considerable coverage in the past few years from both the scientific community and the media.
The arguments for and against links between passive smoking and disease are as fiercely contested among members of the Royal Navy as among civilians.
This article aims to present the current evidence in favour of such a link and also the views on the matter as expressed by the ship's company of a Type 22 frigate.
Their views will be compared to the result of a similar survey carried out among civilian workforces.
Finally, based on the evidence and results presented, strategies for tackling this problem will be discussed.
