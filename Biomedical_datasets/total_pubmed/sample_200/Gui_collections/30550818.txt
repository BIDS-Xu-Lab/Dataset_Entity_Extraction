Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is a complex disease that can affect different metabolic processes, including glucose and lipid metabolic pathways, with a significant impact on the development of heart disease and stroke.
Recent therapy with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), beyond its high efficacy on CHC eradication, showed a beneficial impact on glucose and lipid metabolism.
This review aimed to describe current evidence regarding the association between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and impairment of glucose and lipid metabolism and also discusses potential public-health implications in light of the new DAA therapies and their availability at a global level.
The excellent safety profile and efficacy of DAAs offer an exceptional opportunity to control the HCV pandemic at a global level and represent an opportunity for developing an operational research framework aimed at investigating the complex dynamics between host, pathogen and therapy that lead to metabolic damage in subjects with infectious diseases.
