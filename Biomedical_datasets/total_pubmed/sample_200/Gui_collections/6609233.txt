Novel 3-alkyl-2-aryl-3H- naphth [1,2-d]imidazoles were synthesized and evaluated as antiinflammatory agents in the carrageenin-induced paw edema, cotton pellet induced granuloma, and adjuvant-induced polyarthritis assays in rats.
The analgesic, antipyretic, and gastroulcerogenic effects were also tested.
One of the compounds, 3-(1-methylethyl)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3H- naphth [1,2-d]imidazole (35), was selected for clinical trials as a nonacidic antiinflammatory and analgesic agent.
