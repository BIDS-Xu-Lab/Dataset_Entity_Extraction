COVID-19 being a public health emergency of international concern has emerged in most African countries including Niger.
Niger, a landlocked country, is tasked with controlling the pandemic.
However, of the big challenges the country faced is the fragility of healthcare system which posed limitations to the fight against the virus.
The virus overwhelmed the fragile healthcare system which led to inaccessibility of quality healthcare to the citizens coupled with issues of flooding and economic recession that happened during the pandemic.
The healthcare sectored has further been crippled by exposure and infection of the already insufficient healthcare workers.
In addition to this, there was the burden of NTDs and other communicable and non-communicable diseases that subverted the country in the depths of difficulties.
As per the predictions of World Bank, the poverty curve is likely to escalate due to the outrageous impacts of COVID-19.
Adding on to this, the occurrence of natural disasters such as flooding has further stretched the country.
It's no coincidence that the country would confront plethora of challenges amidst the second wave.
Therefore, timely decision and necessary interventions are needed to strengthen the country's fight against the pandemic.
However, this is only feasible when Nigerien government, international allies and other wealthy nations work closely to ensure that the challenges faced by the healthcare system are tackled.
