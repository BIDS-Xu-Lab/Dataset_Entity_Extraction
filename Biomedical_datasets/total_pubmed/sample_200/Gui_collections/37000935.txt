Objectives of quality principles in the clinical setting present nursing with opportunities for quality patient care but at lower environmental footprint.
This affects patients, hospital personnel, and community because choices reduce climate change and thus support an innovative nursing role.
This article aims to support nursing knowledge to include environment in decisions regarding patient care and reusable versus disposable incontinence underpads (IUPs).
A life cycle analysis was conducted, including soiling, reusable cycles before removal, supply chains, laundry use, and end-of-life environmental impact.
The selection of reusable IUPs versus disposables reduced total natural resource energy consumption by 71%, greenhouse gas emissions by 61%, blue water consumption by 57%, and solid waste by 97%.
The nursing community can use this information in its health care organizations regarding IUP to advocate for decisions to select reusable IUPs that benefit our environment (air, water, and land).
