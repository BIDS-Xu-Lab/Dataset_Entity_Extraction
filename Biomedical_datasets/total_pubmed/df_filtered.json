        "abstract":"BACKGROUND\nOur previous study found degradation to subthalamic neuronal encoding of speech features in Parkinson disease (PD) patients suffering from speech disorders.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo find how timing of speech-related neuronal firing changes in PD patients with speech disorders compared to PD patients without speech disorders.\n\n\nMETHODS\nDuring the implantation of deep brain stimulator (DBS), we recorded the activity of single neurons in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of 18 neurosurgical patients with PD while they articulated, listened to, or imagined articulation of 5 vowel sounds, each following a beep. We compared subthalamic activity of PD patients with (n\u00a0=\u00a010) vs without speech disorders.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn this comparison, patients with speech disorders had longer reaction times and shorter lengths of articulation. Their speech-related neuronal activity preceding speech onset (planning) was delayed relative to the beep, but the time between this activity and the emission of speech sound was similar. Notwithstanding, speech-related neuronal activity following the onset of speech (feedback) was delayed when computed relative to the onset. Only in these patients was the time lag of planning neurons significantly correlated with the reaction time. Neuronal activity in patients with speech disorders was delayed during imagined articulation of vowel sounds but earlier during speech perception.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur findings indicate that longer reaction times in patients with speech disorders are due to STN or earlier activity of the speech control network. This is a first step in locating the source(s) of PD delays within this network and is therefore of utmost importance for future treatment of speech disorders.",

Two weeks later a regimen consisting of 4 doses of benzo(a)pyrene (1 dose\/week p.o. for 4 weeks) was begun to initiate forestomach neoplasia. Twenty-three weeks after the first intubation the animals were sacrificed, and forestomach neoplasms were counted and histologically confirmed. Soy sauce produced a significant dose-dependent reduction in forestomach neoplasms, which appeared to be maximal when soy sauce constituted 20% of the diet. Exposure to nitrite (0-500 ppm through drinking water) neither enhanced nor diminished the anticarcinogenic effect of the dietary soy sauce. Soy sauce was found to contain antioxidant activity which may be related to the observed anticarcinogenic effect. Contrary to expectations, mouse forestomach ornithine decarboxylase activity was induced by soy sauce. This appeared to be due at least in part to the relatively high sodium chloride content of soy sauce.",

        "abstract":"We previously established conditions to reconstitute kinesin-dependent early endocytic vesicle motility and fission on microtubules in vitro. The present study examined the question whether motility and fission are regulated in this system. Screening for proteins by immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the small G protein, Rab4, was associated with 80% of hepatocyte-derived early endocytic vesicles that contain the ligand asialoorosomucoid (ASOR). By contrast, other markers for early endocytic vesicles including clathrin, Rab5 and EEA1 were present in the preparation but did not colocalize with the ASOR vesicles. Guanine nucleotides exchanged into the Rab4 present on the vesicles as shown by solubilization of Rab4 by Rab-GDI; solubilization was inhibited by incubation with GTP-gamma-S and promoted by GDP. Pre-incubation of vesicles with GDP increased the number of vesicles moving on microtubules and markedly increased vesicle fission. This increase in motility from GDP was shown to be towards the minus end of microtubules, possibly through activation of the minus-end-directed kinesin, KIFC2. Pre-incubation of vesicles with GTP-gamma-S, by contrast, repressed motility. Addition of exogenous GST-Rab4- GTP-gamma-S led to a further repression of motility and fission. Repression was not seen with addition of GST-Rab4-GDP. Treatment of vesicles with Rab4 antibody also repressed motility, and repression was not seen when vesicles were pre-incubated with GDP. Based on these results we hypothesize that endogenous Rab4-GTP suppresses motility of ASOR-containing vesicles in hepatocytes and that conversion of Rab4-GTP to Rab4-GDP serves as a molecular switch that activates minus-end kinesin-based motility, facilitating early endosome fission and consequent receptor-ligand segregation.",

        "abstract":"Prospective memory (PM) refers to the ability to perform planned activities in the appropriate future situations. It needs to be planned in advance and processed through multiple stages such as encoding, retention, retrieval, and execution, which usually require more attention resources. Impulsivity trait individuals are usually characterized by lack of consideration, premature expression, excessive risk-taking and easy to make inappropriate reaction, so they are more likely to show disadvantages in PM. Nevertheless, increasing the importance of PM tasks can promote more adequate and effective cue encoding, and encourage individuals to devote attention to PM tasks, which may change the disadvantage of impulsivity individuals in PM performance. In this study, the between-subjects design of 2 (trait type: high-impulsivity trait, low-impulsivity trait) \u00d72 (task importance: important, unimportant) was adopted in the experiment, the 2-back task was used for the ongoing task, and the focal cues were used for the PM task cues. The results showed that the PM accuracy of high-impulsivity trait individuals was lower than that of low-impulsivity trait individuals under the task unimportant condition, but there was no difference between the two traits groups under the task important condition. The results of this study suggested that high-impulsivity trait individuals had a deficit in PM performance, but emphasizing the importance of PM tasks can compensate for their disadvantage in PM performance.",

RNA was poly(A) selected and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Reads were mapped to the human genome (hg19) using TopHat and differential expression analysis was carried out using edgeR (5% false discovery rate). Signalling pathway analysis was carried out using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. IFN signalling was confirmed by western blotting for phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. Response to TNFi was measured at 12 weeks using change in the 28-item DAS (DAS28).\n\n\nRESULTS\nPathway analysis with IPA predicted activation of IFN signalling in RA neutrophils, identifying 178 IFN-response genes regulated by IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3 (P < 0.01). IPA also predicted activation of STAT1, STAT2 and STAT3 transcription factors in RA neutrophils (P < 0.01), which was confirmed by western blotting. Expression of IFN-response genes was heterogeneous and patients could be categorized as IFN-high or IFN-low. Patients in the IFN-high group achieved a better response to TNFi therapy [\u0394DAS28, P = 0.05, odds ratio (OR) 1.4 (95% CI 1.005, 1.950)] than patients in the IFN-low group. The level of expression of IFN-response genes (IFN score) predicted a good response [European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria] to TNFi using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (area under the curve 0.76).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIFN-response genes are significantly up-regulated in RA neutrophils compared with healthy controls. Higher IFN-response gene expression in RA neutrophils correlates with a good response to TNFi therapy.",

        "title":"5-fluorouracil: a pharmacological paradigm in the use of cytotoxics.",
        "abstract":"1. Painstaking progress in drug development is well illustrated by 5-fluorouracil (5FU), originally designed 40 years ago as a fluorinated analogue of the naturally occurring base uracil. Innovative pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic strategies have seen significant clinical improvements for cancer patients over the past decade. 2. 5-Fluorouracil acts by three main mechanisms. Principally, the intermediate metabolite fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate inhibits a key enzyme in pyrimidine biosynthesis, namely thymidylate synthase (TS). Additionally, 5FU is metabolized to ribo- and deoxy-ribonucleotides, which act as false bases for incorporation into RNA and DNA. 3. Biomodulation of 5FU has been attempted with methotrexate (MTX), folinic acid, interferons, cisplatin and radiotherapy. Methotrexate augments the actions of 5FU by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase and decreasing the folate pool required for pyrimidine biosynthesis, inhibiting TS via MTX-polyglutamate and directly inhibiting purine biosynthesis. Interferons increase steady state concentrations of 5FU. 5-Fluorouracil enhances the cytotoxicity of cisplatin and radiotherapy by inhibiting DNA repair. Folinic acid enhances TS inhibition by increasing the intracellular pool of folates that stabilize the 5FU-TS complex. 4. 5-Fluorouracil has a short plasma half-life. Thymidylate synthase inhibition is limited to the S-phase of the cell cycle and only a small fraction of most cancer cells are in S-phase at any one time. Increased response rates seen with infusional protocols may reflect the effective recruitment of additional mechanisms of cytotoxicity, not dependent on cell cycle, including effects on RNA synthesis. 5. Patients with localized metastatic disease may benefit from locoregional treatments. These include hepatic intra-arterial therapy with related compounds, such as floxuridine, which reach high concentrations at sites of tumour, while systemic toxicities are minimized by efficient hepatic clearance. 6. Recent developments include orally bioavailable formulations, such as ftorafur, capecitabine and the combination of 5FU with the dihydropyrimidine phosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor ethynyluracil. Recognition of diurnal variation in the activity of such key enzymes as DPD has led to the administration of 5FU at regulated, variable infusion rates (chronomodulation). These promising pharmacological approaches may further improve clinical outcomes in common cancers.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND\nInternationally wheelchair users are an emerging demographic phenomenon due to their rapidly increasing life-span coupled with accelerated general population ageing. While having significant healthcare and social implications, basic robust epidemiological information of wheelchair users is often lacking due in part to this population's \"hidden\" nature. Increasingly popular in epidemiological research, Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) provides a mechanism for generating unbiased population-based estimates for hard-to-reach populations, overcoming biases inherent within other sampling methods. This paper reports the first published study to employ RDS amongst wheelchair users.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBetween October 2015 and January 2016, a short, successfully piloted, internet-based national survey was initiated. Twenty seeds from diverse organisations were invited to complete the survey then circulate it to peers within their networks following a well-defined protocol. A predetermined reminder protocol was triggered when seeds or their peers failed to respond. All participants were entered into a draw for an iPad.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, 19 people participated (9 women); 12 initial seeds, followed by seven second-wave participants arising from four seeds . Completion time for the survey ranged between 7 and 36 minutes. Despite repeated reminders, no further people were recruited.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nWhile New Zealand wheelchair user numbers are unknown, an estimated 14% of people have physical impairments that limited mobility. The 19 respondents generated from adopting the RDS methodology here thus represents a negligible fraction of wheelchair users in New Zealand, and an insufficient number to ensure equilibrium. While successful in other hard-to-reach populations, applying RDS methodology to wheelchairs users requires further consideration. Formative research exploring areas of network characteristics, acceptability of RDS, appropriate incentive options, and seed selection amongst wheelchair users is needed.",

Emerging data identify postprandial hyperglycaemia (PPHG) as an important predictor of CVD, and several professional bodies, including the International Diabetes Federation, have issued guidelines on the management of PPHG in type 2 diabetes. Guidance on how international recommendations could be implemented in Asian populations is currently lacking. Therefore, a panel of experts from the AP region convened to consider the current status of PPHG and CVD in the region, and to develop recommendations for clinical practice. The group concluded that improved awareness of the impact of PPHG on CVD risk, among clinicians and the general public, and more widespread use of routine screening for PPHG, using oral glucose tolerance testing in those without recognised diabetes, are required. Additionally, frequent meal-based testing and effective PPHG management are essential to the management of IGT and type 2 diabetes.",

Thirty adult male Wistar rats were divided into five groups (six animals per group): control, sham, carbenoxolone (CBX), quinine (QN), and quinidine (QND). An epilepsy model was produced by injecting kainic acid (KA) into the rat amygdala. Broad-spectrum and selective blockers of the Cx36 channel (CBX, QN, and QND) were administered via intraperitoneal injection. Expression of MAP-2 and SYP was assessed by immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical examination. Expression of MAP-2 and SYP was significantly increased after KA administration in the sham group compared with the control group. Expression of MAP-2 and SYP was significantly decreased in the CBX, QN, and QND groups compared with the sham group. The results provide new evidence regarding the key role of MAP-2 and SYP overexpression in three important mechanisms: the modulation of neuronal plasticity, hyperexcitability of the hippocampal neuronal network, and persistent seizure discharge. Furthermore, the reversal of MAP-2 and SYP overexpression following administration of Cx36 channel blockers indicates a potential role for Cx36 channel blockers in anti-epileptogenic treatment and in doing so, highlights a critical need for further investigation of these compounds.",

The C3 amplitudes and peak latencies of the POVEPs and GAs were compared across meridians for both groups (refractive amblyopes and controls) using linear mixed models (monocular) and ANOVA (binocular), and post hoc analysis was conducted to determine if meridional anisotropies in this cohort of amblyopes were related to low (\u22641.50 diopters [D]), moderate (1.75-2.75 D) and high (\u22653.00 D) astigmatism.\n\n\nResults\nIn the newly diagnosed refractive amblyopes, there were no significant meridional anisotropies across all outcome measures, but the post hoc analysis demonstrated that C3 amplitude was significantly higher in those with low (P = 0.02) and moderate (P = 0.004) astigmatism compared to those with high astigmatism. Refractive amblyopes had poorer GA and C3 amplitudes compared to controls by approximately two lines on the logMAR chart (monocular: P = 0.013; binocular: P = 0.014) and approximately 6 \u00b5V (monocular: P = 0.009; binocular: P = 0.027), respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nDeleterious effects of high astigmatism was evident in newly diagnosed refractive amblyopes, but the neural deficits do not seem to be orientation-specific for the stimulus parameters investigated.",

        "title":"Are We Ready to Implement Circadian Hygiene Interventions and Programs?",
        "abstract":"Circadian hygiene, a concept not to be confused with the notion of public or social hygiene, should be discussed among experts and society. Light-dark cycles and other possible synchronizers of the human circadian timing system affect ways of life, including sleeping, eating, working and physical activity. Some of these behaviors have also been investigated individually as synchronizers (e.g., eating times). Therefore, the knowledge held today about circadian rhythms, and their implications for health, allows future perspectives in this field to be mapped. The present article summarizes the latest knowledge on factors influencing circadian rhythms to discuss a perspective for the future of health promotion based on circadian hygiene. However, it is important to highlight that circadian hygiene is the product of an imbrication of individual and societal involvement. First, it is important to adopt practices and devise public health policies in line with circadian hygiene. Second, individual healthy habits require internal rhythms to be examined. Last, the research agenda on circadian hygiene can be developed on a public as well as individual level, raising the question as to how much society is willing to embrace this change.",

        "abstract":"Burst suppression, a pattern of the electroencephalogram characterized by quasi-periodic alternation of high-voltage activity (burst) and isoelectric silence (suppression), is typically associated with states of unconsciousness, such as in deep general anesthesia and certain etiologies of coma. Recent computational models for burst suppression have attributed the slow (up to tens of seconds) time-scale of burst termination and re-initiation to cycling in supportive physiological process, such as cerebral metabolism. That is, activity-dependent substrate ('energy') depletion during bursts, followed by substrate recovery during suppression. Such a model falls into the category of a fast-slow dynamical system, commonly used to describe neuronal bursting more generally. Here, following this basic paradigm, we develop a low dimensional mean field model for burst suppression that adds several new features and capabilities to previous models. Most notably, this new model includes explicit homeostatic interactions wherein the rates of substrate recovery are tied to neuronal activity in a supply demand loop, creating a physiologically consistent, reciprocal interaction between the neural and substrate processes. We develop formal analysis of the model dynamics, showing, in particular, the capability of the model to produce burst-like activity as a consequence of neuronal downregulation only, without any direct perturbation to the substrate dynamics. Further, we use a synchronization analysis to contrast different mechanisms for spatially local versus global bursting. The analysis performed generates characterizations that are consistent with experimental observations of spatiotemporal features such as burst onset, duration, and spatial organization and, moreover, generates predictions regarding the presence of bistability and hysteresis in the underlying system. Thus, the model provides new dynamical insight into the mechanisms of burst suppression and, moreover, a tractable platform for more detailed future characterizations.",

        "abstract":"This paper treats the very specific history of one aspect of space policy and how it, or more specifically its name, developed in the first two decades of the Space Age. The concepts of preventing the biological and organic contamination of other planetary bodies, which also protect the biosphere from the consequences of finding extraterrestrial life and returning it to Earth, were established in the late 1950s with the beginning of the Space Age. Within their first decade, those concepts were labeled \"planetary quarantine,\" a name that suggested the concepts but unfortunately came with latent baggage of its own. Over time, that sobriquet was replaced by the more prosaic \"planetary protection,\" which has less of a baggage problem and has come to be used in common parlance to describe this contamination avoidance within the spaceflight community. This paper does not duplicate material found in the \"official\" NASA history of planetary protection (Meltzer, 2011 ), which covered this specific subject only broadly, nor was the same material presented by Meltzer's predecessor (Phillips, 1974 ), who could not cover it because it had not happened yet.",

Central to the guiding incel ideology and master narrative are violent misogynistic beliefs and an attitude of entitlement, based on male gender and social positioning, with respect to obtaining desired and often illusory sexual experiences. While violence and hate speech within the incel community are both common, there exists a notable subset of incels who have been willing to act on those violent beliefs through the commission of acts of multiple murder. This study explores the demographic, cognitive, and other characteristics of seven self-identified incels who have attempted and\/or successfully completed homicide. The findings suggest that although self-perceptions tend to reflect either grandiosity or self-deprecation, homicidal incels share similar demographic characteristics and dense common clusters of neutralization techniques, cognitive distortions, and criminal thinking errors.",

The authors reported a prospective study carried out at the Hospital Center of the University of Mahajanga for ten months (January-October 1993). 500 patients were investigated. 465 results of cervix and vaginal smears were considered. The Bethesda group classification was used to interpret lesions. 333 specific pathological lesions were listed. Bacterial infections and trichomoniasis were their principal causes. 4 cases were presumed as human papillomavirus condylomata. 39 SIL low-grade and 24 SIL high-grade were detected. 5 cervix neoplasms were diagnosed. Only few patients had consultation to perform cervix and vaginal smears because these exams are expensive. It may be an explication to the chronicity of lesions, a favourising factor of cancer. The role of viruses, especially human papillomavirus, in the development of cervix neoplasms is mentioned. The authors conclude that the low number of cervix neoplasms they founded is misleading. Cervix neoplasms are the first female cancers in Madagascar. A systematic surveillance of all female genitalia diseases must be programed.

This study was aimed to investigate the additive effects of antiresorptive agent zoledronic acid (ZOL), alone and in combination with propranolol (PRO) in a rat model of disuse osteoporosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn the present study, 3-month-old male Wistar rats had their right hind-limb immobilized (RHLI) for 10 weeks to induce osteopenia, then were randomized into four groups: 1- RHLI positive control, 2- RHLI plus ZOL (50 \u03bcg\/kg, i.v. single dose), 3- RHLI plus PRO (0.1mg\/kg, s.c. 5 days per week), 4- RHLI plus PRO (0.1mg\/kg, s.c. 5 days per week) plus ZOL (50 \u03bcg\/kg, i.v. single dose) for another 10 weeks. One group of non-immobilized rats was used as negative control. At the end of treatment, the femurs were removed and tested for bone porosity, bone mechanical properties, and bone dry and ash weight.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWith respect to improvement in the mechanical strength of the femoral mid-shaft, the combination treatment with ZOL plus PRO was more effective than ZOL or PRO monotherapy. Moreover, combination therapy using ZOL plus PRO was more effective in improving dry bone weight and preserved the cortical bone porosity better than monotherapy using ZOL or PRO in right hind-limb immobilized rats.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese data suggest that this combined treatment with ZOL plus PRO should be recommended for the treatment of disuse osteoporosis.",

However, prolonged exposure to hyperoxia leads to the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing cellular damage and multiple organ dysfunctions. As the lungs are directly exposed, hyperoxia can cause both acute and chronic inflammatory lung injury and compromise innate immunity. ROS may contribute to pulmonary oxygen toxicity by overwhelming redox homeostasis, altering signaling cascades that affect cell fate, ultimately leading to hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury (HALI). HALI is characterized by pronounced inflammatory responses with leukocyte infiltration, injury, and death of pulmonary cells, including epithelia, endothelia, and macrophages. Under hyperoxic conditions, ROS mediate both direct and indirect modulation of signaling molecules such as protein kinases, transcription factors, receptors, and pro- and anti-apoptotic factors. The focus of this review is to elaborate on hyperoxia-activated key sensing molecules and current understanding of their signaling mechanisms in HALI. A better understanding of the signaling pathways leading to HALI may provide valuable insights on its pathogenesis and may help in designing more effective therapeutic approaches.",

        "abstract":"Introduction: Recent findings indicate that metabolic disturbances are involved in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology and influence the susceptibility to treatment, directing attention toward anti-diabetic drugs such as metformin and pioglitazone. Liraglutide, a drug of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) family, is also anti-diabetic and weight-reducing and is, moreover, directly neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory in a broad spectrum of experimental models of brain disease. In this study we investigate the potential for this FDA-approved drug, liraglutide, as a treatment for MS by utilizing the experimental model, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Methods: EAE was induced in 30 female Lewis rats that subsequently received twice-daily liraglutide (200 \u03bcg\/kg s.c.) or saline. Healthy controls were included (saline, n = 6, liraglutide, n = 7). Clinical score and weight were assessed daily by blinded observers. Animals were killed at peak disease severity (day 11) or if exceeding humane endpoint (clinical score \u22654). Protein levels of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), amyloid precursor protein (APP), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were determined. Results: Liraglutide treatment delayed disease onset (group clinical score significantly >0) by 2 days and markedly reduced disease severity (median clinical score 2 vs. 5; p = 0.0003). Fourteen of 15 (93%) of vehicle-treated rats reached the humane endpoint (clinical score \u22654) by day 11 compared to 5 of 15 (33%) of liraglutide-treated rats (p = 0.0004). Liraglutide substantially increased the mitochondrial antioxidant MnSOD (p < 0.01) and reduced the neurodegenerative marker APP (p = 0.036) in the brain. GFAP levels were not significantly changed with drug treatment (p = 0.09). Conclusion: We demonstrate, for the first time, that liraglutide treatment delays onset of EAE in Lewis rats and is associated with improved protective capacity against oxidative stress. These data suggest GLP-1 receptor agonists should be investigated further as a potential therapy for MS.",

Here, we identify a mechanism that regulates adiposity based on the activator of autophagy TP53INP2. We report that TP53INP2 is a negative regulator of adipogenesis in human and mouse preadipocytes. In keeping with this, TP53INP2 ablation in mice caused enhanced adiposity, which was characterized by greater cellularity of subcutaneous adipose tissue and increased expression of master adipogenic genes. TP53INP2 modulates adipogenesis through autophagy-dependent sequestration of GSK3\u03b2 into late endosomes. GSK3\u03b2 sequestration was also dependent on ESCRT activity. As a result, TP53INP2 promotes greater \u03b2-catenin levels and induces the transcriptional activity of TCF\/LEF transcription factors. These results demonstrate a link between autophagy, sequestration of GSK3\u03b2 into late endosomes and inhibition of adipogenesis in vivo.",

Rats with meningeal carcinomatosis received a single intravenous dose of cyclophosphamide (30 mg\/kg) or ACNU (15 mg\/kg) at various times after intracisternal inoculation of 1 X 10(4) Walker 256 carcinosarcoma cells. Cyclophosphamide, administered 1 day after tumor inoculation, failed to prevent tumor growth in the subarachnoid space. The survival time of these rats was prolonged only 10% to 14% compared to the controls, while ACNU produced a maximum increased survival time of 180%. If administered 2, 3, 4, and 5 days after tumor inoculation, both drugs were effective; cyclophosphamide yielded a maximum increase in median survival time of 109%, 94%, 90%, and 52%, and ACNU 127%, 139%, 240%, and 100%, respectively. These results indicate that the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier was circumvented in the early stage of subarachnoid tumor growth, although some areas remained where the infiltrating tumor cells were protected from systemically administered drugs by the intact barrier.",

Analogous lipid ordering is also found in an artificial lipid mixture of the major lipid components of the tear film, suggesting that the 2D ordering is set by generic lipid-lipid interactions. Fluorescence microscopy of the natural and artificial tear film mixture reveals the co-existence of a dilute and a much more condensed phase in the amphiphilic lipid matrix over the pressure range of 15-45mN\/m investigated by GIXD, plus an additional structure due to the much more hydrophobic part of the mixture.

Our goal was to develop an efficient algorithm in structured query language (SQL) to determine the Elixhauser comorbidity index. We wrote an SQL algorithm to calculate the Elixhauser comorbidities from Diagnosis Related Group and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. Validation was by comparison to expected comorbidities from combinations of these codes and to the 2013 Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD). The SQL algorithm matched perfectly with expected comorbidities for all combinations of ICD-9 or ICD-10, and Diagnosis Related Groups. Of 13\u2009585\u2009859 evaluable NRD records, the algorithm matched 100% of the listed comorbidities. Processing time was \u223c0.05\u2009ms\/record. The SQL Elixhauser code was efficient and computationally identical to the SAS algorithm used for the NRD. This algorithm may be useful where preprocessing of large datasets in a relational database environment and comorbidity determination is desired before statistical analysis. A validated SQL procedure to calculate Elixhauser comorbidities and the van Walraven index from ICD-9 or ICD-10 discharge diagnosis codes has been published.",

        "abstract":"Glioblastoma is the most common and deadliest brain tumour in adults, with a median survival of 15 months under the current standard of care. Immunotherapies like immune checkpoint inhibitors and oncolytic viruses have been extensively studied to improve this endpoint. However, most thus far have failed. To improve the efficacy of immunotherapies to treat glioblastoma, new single-cell imaging modalities like imaging mass cytometry can be leveraged and integrated with computational models. This enables a better understanding of the tumour microenvironment and its role in treatment success or failure in this hard-to-treat tumour. Here, we implemented an agent-based model that allows for spatial predictions of combination chemotherapy, oncolytic virus, and immune checkpoint inhibitors against glioblastoma. We initialised our model with patient imaging mass cytometry data to predict patient-specific responses and found that oncolytic viruses drive combination treatment responses determined by intratumoral cell density. We found that tumours with higher tumour cell density responded better to treatment. When fixing the number of cancer cells, treatment efficacy was shown to be a function of CD4\u2009+\u2009T cell and, to a lesser extent, of macrophage counts. Critically, our simulations show that care must be put into the integration of spatial data and agent-based models to effectively capture intratumoral dynamics. Together, this study emphasizes the use of predictive spatial modelling to better understand cancer immunotherapy treatment dynamics, while highlighting key factors to consider during model design and implementation.",

        "abstract":"There has been an exponential increase in the use of electronic devices over the past few decades. This has led to increased exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF). Electric fields result from differences in voltage, whereas magnetic fields result from the flow of electric current. Higher-frequency waves of EMF have more energy than lower-frequency waves, and thus generally tend to be more harmful. An EMF activates cellular stress response and also causes breaks in DNA strands. There are many methodological barriers to effectively measuring the associations of EMF and childhood cancers. The consensus from multiple studies is that there is no causal role of extremely low-frequency EMFs in childhood cancers, including brain cancer. A recent study showed a link between EMF radiation and the development of malignant tumors in rats. In light of that study, the American Academy of Pediatrics set out new recommendations to decrease the adverse effects of cellphone exposure on children. [Pediatr Ann. 2017;46(4):e172-e174.].",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND\nDisorders-of-consciousness (DOC) are rare conditions leading to very severe physical and mental disabilities. Providing care for DOC patients has been described as a stressful experience, eroding the physical and psychological health of the caregiver. Different forms of care may have different impacts on the caregivers and institutionalized care has been suggested to have an unburdening effect, but this possibility has never been empirically studied. To address this issue, in this study caregiver-burden between family-caregivers who provide home care themselves and those who have placed their patients in a specialized care unit is compared.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe demographics of the caregivers, life satisfaction, coping strategies, meaning in life, and grief reactions were assessed with questionnaires in 81 long term (m\u2009=\u20097.9\u2009years) caregivers (44 patients in specialized care-units, 37 patients taken care of at home).\n\n\nRESULTS\nCaregiver groups were similar on the vast majority of demographic factors. Remarkably, there were no major differences in self-assessed burden and distress between the two caregiver groups. They both demonstrated generally reduced life satisfaction, were especially dissatisfied with their amount of spare time, and many caregivers in both groups demonstrated long lasting grief reactions, as well as a somewhat enhanced crisis of meaning. However, caregivers with patients in institutionalized care exhibited enhanced self-accusation as well as reduced satisfaction with their own health. Home care caregivers, on the other hand, report below average opportunities to care for themselves.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSurprisingly, placement in institutionalized care in itself does not seem to disburden caregivers as much as expected as the amount of subjective care-giving burden and reported distress is on average similarly high, although profiles differ somewhat according to type of care. Moreover, vast inter-individual variability can be observed. Further research should address the mechanisms that foster positive adjustment and reduce negative impacts for care providers regardless of type of care, enabling the health care system, institutions and self-aid groups alike, to provide more specific support for caregivers by addressing the topics of quality-of-life, own health, self care, and grief reactions.",

        "abstract":"Cochlear hair cell loss is a leading cause of deafness in humans. Neighboring supporting cells have some capacity to regenerate hair cells. However, their regenerative potential sharply declines as supporting cells undergo maturation (postnatal day 5 in mice). We recently reported that reactivation of the RNA-binding protein LIN28B restores the hair cell-regenerative potential of P5 cochlear supporting cells. Here, we identify the LIN28B target Trim71 as a novel and equally potent enhancer of supporting cell plasticity. TRIM71 is a critical regulator of stem cell behavior and cell reprogramming; however, its role in cell regeneration is poorly understood. Employing an organoid-based assay, we show that TRIM71 re-expression increases the mitotic and hair cell-forming potential of P5 cochlear supporting cells by facilitating their de-differentiation into progenitor-like cells. Our mechanistic work indicates that TRIM71's RNA-binding activity is essential for such ability, and our transcriptomic analysis identifies gene modules that are linked to TRIM71 and LIN28B-mediated supporting cell reprogramming. Furthermore, our study uncovers that the TRIM71-LIN28B target Hmga2 is essential for supporting cell self-renewal and hair cell formation.",

Yet empirical research is limited, leaving discussion on a theoretical level. There are also divergent ideas as to what extent it should be respected. In this study, we explored the clinical preconditions for disclosure of increased risk of getting diabetes in children. We included questions in the clinical 5-year questionnaire of a predictive screening for the risk of type 1 diabetes (T1DM), asking the respondents (n=7206) whether they wished to be informed of their children's potential risk status. The group of 2% of the respondents who did not want to know about risk status proved to be significantly associated to concern with natural history data (OR 4.03), lack of knowledge (OR 3.17), pressure to participate (OR 2.99) and the child's disease development (OR 2.18). We discuss whether parents'\/participants' 'no' to high-risk information may call for a more nuanced response such as information and support, rather than simply respect their wish not to know. We furthermore argue that it is ethically questionable whether the parents' expressed wish not to know should prima facie override the potential benefits for their child.

        "abstract":"Reaction with halogen vapor allows us to post-synthetically exchange halides in both three- (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) organic-inorganic metal-halide perovskites. Films of 3D Pb-I perovskites cleanly convert to films of Pb-Br or Pb-Cl perovskites upon exposure to Br2 or Cl2 gas, respectively. This gas-solid reaction provides a simple method to produce the high-quality Pb-Br or Pb-Cl perovskite films required for optoelectronic applications. Reactivity with halogens can be extended to the organic layers in 2D metal-halide perovskites. Here, terminal alkene groups placed between the inorganic layers can capture Br2 gas through chemisorption to form dibromoalkanes. This reaction's selectivity for Br2 over I2 allows us to scrub Br2 to obtain high-purity I2 gas streams. We also observe unusual halogen transfer between the inorganic and organic layers within a single perovskite structure. Remarkably, the perovskite's crystallinity is retained during these massive structural rearrangements.",

        "abstract":"OBJECTIVE\nThis study was conducted to assess the possible weekend effect in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) on the basis of a 10-year single-center experience in Serbia.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA retrospective analysis of hospital records in the University Clinic 'Dr Dragisa Misovic-Dedinje', Belgrade, Serbia, from 2002 to 2012 was conducted. Patients admitted for UGIB were identified, and data on demographic characteristics, symptoms, drug use, alcohol abuse, diagnosis and treatment were collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to assess the association between weekend admission and the occurrence of rebleeding and in-hospital mortality.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAnalyses included 493 patients. Rebleeding occurred significantly more frequently on weekends (45.7 vs. 32.7%, P=0.004). Weekend admission [odds ratio (OR)=1.78; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15-2.74], older age (OR=1.02; 95% CI: 1.00-1.03), and the presence of both melaena and hematemesis (OR=2.29; 95% CI: 1.29-4.07) were associated with the occurrence of rebleeding. No difference between weekend and weekday admissions was observed for the in-hospital mortality rate (6.9% vs. 6.0%, P=0.70). Older age (OR=1.14; 95% CI: 1.08-1.20), presentation with melaena and hematemesis (OR=4.12; 95% CI: 1.56-10.90) and need for surgical treatment (OR=5.16; 95% CI: 1.61-16.53) were significant predictors of all-cause mortality. Patients with nonvariceal bleeding had significantly higher rebleeding rates on weekends (44 vs. 32.3%, P=0.013).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThere was no significant weekend effect in the mortality of patients admitted for UGIB, irrespective of the source of bleeding. Increased attention to older patients presenting with a more severe clinical picture is needed to prolong survival and prevent rebleeding.",

In the present study, tissue samples were collected from 226 patients with breast cancer. Subsequently, immunohistochemical analysis was performed to detect the expression of \u03b2-catenin, cyclin D1 and ER-\u03b2, and the Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis. The abnormal expression rate of \u03b2-catenin was 75.2%, while the cyclin D1 positive expression rate was 77.0% and the ER-\u03b2 positive expression rate was 43.4%. In the tissue samples exhibiting abnormal expression of \u03b2-catenin, the positive expression rate of cyclin D1 (85.9%) was significantly higher compared with the samples that expressed \u03b2-catenin normally (50.0%). Furthermore, the positive expression rate of ER-\u03b2 (35.7%) in the \u03b2-catenin normal expression tissues was significantly lower compared with that in the \u03b2-catenin abnormal expression tissues (45.9%). In the tissues with positive cyclin D1 expression, the positive expression rate of ER-\u03b2 (48.4%) was significantly higher compared with the cyclin D1 negative expression samples (26.9%). In addition, patients with normal expression of \u03b2-catenin and positive expression of cyclin D1 exhibited longer tumor-free survival times.

        "abstract":"Myo-inositol (MI) influx as a function of concentration in rat lens consisted of a saturable component, fit by a rectangular hyperbola, and a linear component which was more distinct at high myo-inositol concentrations suggesting passive diffusion. The hyperbolic component was half-maximally saturated (Kt) at 61.3 microM and had a maximal transport rate (Jmax) of 44.6 mumol\/kg wet wt\/h. The linear component had an apparent permeability coefficient of 1.44 x 10(-6) s-1. Sorbitol, which distributed rapidly in the extracellular space (6.83 ml\/100 g wet wt), also appeared to enter the intracellular space with a permeability coefficient of 1.37 x 10(-6) s-1, similar to that of myo-inositol. The influx of myo-inositol was critically dependent on the concentration of extracellular sodium consistent with a sodium-myo-inositol cotransport. The kinetics of influx activation by sodium suggested an apparent 2:1 coupling ratio for sodium and myo-inositol. When potassium was used as sodium substitute, a significantly stronger influx inhibition was observed than with nondepolarizing sodium substitutes, indicating that myo-inositol was driven by the electrochemical gradient of sodium rather than the chemical gradient only. Reducing the extracellular Na concentration increased the MI concentration at which transport was half-maximally activated, suggesting an ordered binding sequence of Na followed by MI. Myo-inositol influx was competitively inhibited by phlorizin with an inhibitory coefficient (Ki) of 35 microM. Phloretin also was capable of inhibition but with a much lesser efficacy. Myo-inositol desaturates from the lens at a rate of 0.00862 h-1. Approximately 19% of the efflux can be inhibited with phlorizin, suggesting that it represents carrier-mediated flux. The phlorizin insensitive flux has a rate of 0.00695 h-1 or 1.93 x 10(-6) s-1, similar to the Na-independent passive influx. MI influx is due to a Na-dependent, phlorizin-sensitive active transport while the efflux consists largely of a phlorizin-independent passive leakage.",

The intensity and timing of the therapy are based on the presence or predicted risk of central nervous system leukemia as assessed according to criteria that remain controversial.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe clinical importance of leukemic blast cells detected in cerebrospinal fluid at the time of diagnosis was evaluated in 351 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a randomized trial of intensive chemotherapy. All patients received intrathecal chemotherapy during the first year. Patients considered to be at high risk of relapse because of their clinical and cytogenetic features also received cranial irradiation and intrathecal chemotherapy one year after remission. Patients were considered to have central nervous system leukemia at diagnosis if they had at least 5 leukocytes per microliter of cerebrospinal fluid, with leukemic blast cells apparent in cytocentrifuged preparations, or cranial-nerve palsy; they received additional intrathecal injections of chemotherapeutic agents and cranial irradiation. Patients were retrospectively classified on the basis of cerebrospinal fluid findings: 291 patients had no detectable blast cells, 42 had fewer than 5 leukocytes per microliter and blast cells, and 18 had central nervous system leukemia as defined above. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of treatment in these groups were analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe five-year probability of survival free of relapses confined to the central nervous system in patients with detectable blast cells and fewer than 5 leukocytes per microliter of cerebrospinal fluid was lower than in patients without blast cells (mean [+\/- SE], 87 +\/- 13 vs. 96 +\/- 2 percent), but was not different from the probability in patients with central nervous system leukemia at diagnosis. All such isolated relapses of leukemia in patients with detectable blast cells occurred during the first year of treatment, before scheduled cranial irradiation. In a multivariate analysis, the presence of cerebrospinal fluid blast cells with fewer than 5 leukocytes per microliter was independently related to the risk of relapse confined to the central nervous system.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients with leukemic blast cells in their cerebrospinal fluid are at increased risk for central nervous system relapse when cranial irradiation is delayed. Such patients require intensified central nervous system treatment early in the course of therapy.",

        "abstract":"The Swedish Family-Cancer Database has been used for almost 10 years in the study of familial risks at all common sites. In the present paper we describe some main features of version VI of this Database, assembled in 2004. This update included all Swedes born in 1932 and later (offspring) with their biological parents, a total of 10.5 million individuals. Cancer cases were retrieved from the Swedish Cancer Registry from 1958-2002, including over 1.2 million first and multiple primary cancers and in situ tumours. Compared to previous versions, only 6.0% of deceased offspring with a cancer diagnosis lack any parental information. We show one application of the Database in the study of familial risks in colorectal adenocarcinoma, with defined age-group and anatomic site specific analyses. Familial standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were determined for offspring when parents or sibling were diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer. As a novel finding it was shown that risks for siblings were higher than those for offspring of affected parents. The excess risk was limited to colon cancer and particularly to right-sided colon cancer. The SIRs for colon cancer in age matched populations were 2.58 when parents were probands and 3.81 when siblings were probands; for right-sided colon cancer the SIRs were 3.66 and 7.53, respectively. Thus the familial excess (SIR-1.00) was more than two fold higher for right-sided colon cancer. Colon and rectal cancers appeared to be distinguished between high-penetrant and recessive conditions that only affect the colon, whereas low-penetrant familial effects are shared by the two sites. Epidemiological studies can be used to generate clinical estimates for familial risk, conditioned on numbers of affected family members and their ages of onset. Useful risk estimates have been developed for familial breast and prostate cancers. Reliable risk estimates for other cancers should also be seriously considered for routine clinical recommendations, because practically all cancers show a familial effect and the risks are high for some of the rare neoplasms. The implementation of a unified management plan for familial cancers at large will be a major challenge to the clinical genetic counselling community.",

The epidemiology of GEP-NEN was investigated in this study using currently available criteria.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAll patients diagnosed with GEP-NEN between January 2003 and December 2013 in a well defined Norwegian population of approximately 350 000 people were included. Age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates were calculated. The current 2010 World Health Organization criteria, European Neuroendocrine Tumour Society classification and International Union Against Cancer (UICC) classification were used.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 204 patients (114 male, 55.9 per cent) were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 61 (range 10-94) years. The annual overall crude incidence was 5.83 per 100,000 inhabitants, with an increasing trend (P = 0.033). The most frequent location was small intestine (60 patients, 29.4 per cent) followed by appendix (48 patients, 23.5 per cent) and pancreas (33 patients, 16.2 per cent). Grade 1 tumours were more common in gastrointestinal (100 patients, 58.5 per cent) than in pancreatic (9 patients, 27 per cent) NEN. According to the UICC classification, 77 patients (37.7 per cent) had stage I, 17 patients (8.3 per cent) stage II, 37 patients (18.1 per cent) stage III and 70 patients (34.3 per cent) had stage IV disease. No patient with stage I disease had grade 3 tumours; advanced tumour grade increased with stage.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA high crude incidence of GEP-NEN, at 5.83 per 100,000 inhabitants, was noted together with a significant increasing trend over time.",

        "abstract":"Osteoporosis in men is a disease that is increasing in incidence, and with an increasing elderly population it poses a serious health problem. Since both testosterone (T) and growth hormone (GH) have an anabolic effect on bone and both decrease with aging, we were prompted to test whether the administration of these hormones in combination would increase bone mass in orchiectomized (orx) senile rats more than administration of either agent alone. Twenty-month-old male Wistar rats were divided into five groups with seven animals each: (a) age-matched intact control, (b) orx, (c) orx+GH (2.5 mg\/kg\/day), (d) orx+T [10 mg\/kg, subcutaneous (s.c.), injection given twice a week], and (e) orx+GH+T. Testosterone and GH were given subcutaneously for 4 weeks. Bone histomorphometry of the tibial shaft showed that the orx group had lower cortical bone area than the intact control group. The decrease in cortical bone area was due to increased intracortical porosis as well as decreased periosteal bone formation rate (BFR). Administration of T to the orx animals prevented the development of the porosis and the decrease in periosteal BFR. The bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) of the femur as tested by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were significantly higher in the orx+T than in the orx group and were not significantly different from that of the intact control group. Administration of GH to the orx rats increased periosteal BFR significantly; however, the BMC and BMD measured were not increased significantly in comparison to the orx group. When GH and T were combined in treatment, the cortical bone area, periosteal BFR, and femoral BMD were all significantly higher than that of the orx and even higher than the intact control rats. Two-way analysis of variance shows that the individual effect of GH and T treatment on the periosteal BFR and cortical bone area was significant. The effect of T, but not GH, on femoral BMC and BMD was also significant; however, there is no synergistic interaction between the two treatments. Four weeks of orx with or without GH or T administration had no significant effect on tibial metaphyseal cancellous bone volume. In conclusion, this short-term study suggests that the combined intervention of GH and T in androgen-deficient aged male rats may have an independent effect in preventing osteopenia. The significant effect of GH+T may be attributed to the prevention of intracortical porosis, and an increase in periosteal bone formation and cortical bone mass.",

        "abstract":"Speech comprehension requires listeners to rapidly parse continuous speech into hierarchically-organized linguistic structures (i.e. syllable, word, phrase, and sentence) and entrain the neural activities to the rhythm of different linguistic levels. Aging is accompanied by changes in speech processing, but it remains unclear how aging affects different levels of linguistic representation. Here, we recorded magnetoencephalography signals in older and younger groups when subjects actively and passively listened to the continuous speech in which hierarchical linguistic structures of word, phrase, and sentence were tagged at 4, 2, and 1\u00a0Hz, respectively. A newly-developed parameterization algorithm was applied to separate the periodically linguistic tracking from the aperiodic component. We found enhanced lower-level (word-level) tracking, reduced higher-level (phrasal- and sentential-level) tracking, and reduced aperiodic offset in older compared with younger adults. Furthermore, we observed the attentional modulation on the sentential-level tracking being larger for younger than for older ones. Notably, the neuro-behavior analyses showed that subjects' behavioral accuracy was positively correlated with the higher-level linguistic tracking, reversely correlated with the lower-level linguistic tracking. Overall, these results suggest that the enhanced lower-level linguistic tracking, reduced higher-level linguistic tracking and less flexibility of attentional modulation may underpin aging-related decline in speech comprehension.",

        "abstract":"We numerically demonstrate orthogonally polarized dual-comb generation in a single microcavity with normal dispersion assisted by the cross-phase modulation (XPM) effect. It is found that the XPM effect facilitates the emission of a secondary polarized comb with different temporal properties in a wide existence range covering the blue- to red-detuned regime and thus releases the requirements for delicate control on the detuned region of pump frequency. Also, the energy transfer between two polarization components together with the normal-dispersion property contributes to a more balanced intensity difference and significantly increased conversion efficiency from the pump light into the comb operation. This work could provide a route to a low-cost and compact mid-infrared dual-comb system with a lower power requirement as well as an effective approach to higher comb teeth power with improved efficiency for practical applications.",

        "abstract":"Two experiments were performed to determine the anthelmintic effect of some phytogenic feed additives on a mild infection of Ascaris suum in growing and finishing pigs. Usually, an infection of A. suum is controlled by using conventional synthetic drugs. Organic farmers, however, prefer a non-pharmaceutical approach to worm control. Therefore, phytotherapy could be an appropriate alternative. In the first experiment, a commercial available organic starter diet was supplemented with 3% of a herb mixture, adding 1% Thymus vulgaris, 1% Melissa officinalis and 1% Echinacea purpurea to the diet, or with 4% of a herb mixture, thereby adding the mentioned herbs plus 1% Camellia sinensis (black tea). A negative control group (no treatment) and a positive control group (treatment with conventional synthetic drug flubendazole) were included. In the second experiment, the anthelmintic properties against A. suum of three individual herbs, Carica papaya, Peumus boldus and Artemisia vulgaris, each in a dose of 1%, were tested. Pigs were infected with 1000 infective worm eggs each. Each experiment was performed with 32 individually housed growing pigs (8 replicates\/treatment), which were monitored for 67 days. It was hypothesized that the herbs would block the cycles of the larvae, thereby preventing the development of adult worms. Therefore, phytogenic feed additives were not supplied during the whole experimental period, but only from the start until D39. Pigs were inoculated with infective worm eggs during five consecutive days (D17-D21). At D67 all pigs were dissected, whereafter livers were checked for the presence of white spots. Also numbers of worms in the small intestine were counted. In experiment 1, the numbers of worm-infected pigs were similar for both the herb supplemented (groups 3 and 4) and the unsupplemented (group 1) treatments (5-6 pigs of 8), while the treatment with flubendazole (group 2) resulted in 0 infected pigs. In experiment 2, herb addition (groups 2-4) did not significantly reduce the number of worm-infected pigs compared to the negative control (group 1). It can be concluded that the tested herb mixtures and individual herbs in the diets of growing and finishing pigs did not decrease the number of pigs which were infected with A. suum, although the herb mixture without black tea and also boldo leaf slightly (P<0.10) reduced the number of worms in the intestinal tract. The tested herb mixtures and individual herbs did not affect the performance of the pigs.",

Three databases, including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, were searched on July 24, 2022. A total of 1,535,129 patients were enrolled in the seven included studies for analysis. According to our analysis, LC was a risk factor for postoperative overall complications (OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.21 to 1.81, I2 = 90.35%, P = 0.00 < 0.1). For various complications, more patients developed pulmonary (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.21 to 2.87, I2 = 90.79%, P = 0.00 < 0.1), gastrointestinal (OR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.32 to 3.11, I2 = 0.00%, P = 0.00 < 0.05), renal (OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.41 to 3.45, I2 = 91.60%, P = 0.00 < 0.1), neurological (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.26, I2 = 7.35%, P = 0.01 < 0.05), and infectious (OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.17 to 3.50, I2 = 92.37%, P = 0.01 < 0.1) complications after surgery in the LC group.

The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the application of L-Mesitran Soft\u00ae, a product containing 40% medical grade honey (MGH), with other strategies to improve ovarian grafts' viability. For this purpose, bovine ovarian tissue was vitrified, warmed and randomly assigned to culture groups: (1) control, (2) MGH 0.2% in vitro, (3) MGH in vivo (direct application in the xenotransplantation), (4) vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF 50 ng\/mL) and (5) vitamin D (100 Nm), during a 48 h period. A sixth group (6) of fragments was thawed on transplantation day and was not cultured. The tissue was xenotransplanted into immunodeficient (Rowett nude homozygous) ovariectomized rats. Grafts were analyzed 48 h after culture, and 7 and 28 days after transplantation. The tissue was subjected to histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Treatments using MGH showed the highest angiogenic and cell proliferation stimulation, with cellular apoptosis, within a healthy cellular turnover pathway. In conclusion, MGH should be considered as a potentially effective and less expensive strategy to improve ovarian tissue transplantation.",

Most state Medicaid programs have covered this service during medical visits for children aged 1 to 5 years, but private insurers began covering it only in 2015 due to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandate that they cover a set of recommended preventive services without cost-sharing. Evidence on clinicians' behavior change postmandate is limited. To examine monthly changes in fluoride varnish applications among pediatric clinicians following the ACA mandate. Using all-payer claims data from Massachusetts, this cohort study applied an interrupted time-series approach with linear regression models comparing changes in monthly clinician-level outcomes before and after the mandate. Participants included clinicians who billed at least 5 well-child visits for patients aged 1 to 5 years and were observed at least once premandate. Adjusted for clinician fixed effects, models were assessed overall and separately for clinicians categorized by their monthly share of well-child visits paid by private insurers before the mandate: mostly private (>66% of visits paid by private insurers), mostly public (<33% of visits paid by private insurers), or mixed (33%-66% of visits paid by private insurers) insurance types. Analysis was performed from June 1, 2022, to July 31, 2023. Preenactment and postenactment of the ACA mandate for private insurers to cover fluoride varnish applications without cost-sharing. Clinician-month measures of whether fluoride varnish was provided during at least 1 well-child visit and the share of such visits, analyzed separately for clinicians who did and did not apply fluoride varnish premandate. The sample included 2405 clinicians, with 107\u202f841 clinician-months. Premandate, 10.48% of the visits included fluoride varnish applications. Two years postmandate, the likelihood of ever applying fluoride varnish was 13.64 (95% CI, 10.97-16.32) percentage points higher. For clinicians providing fluoride varnish premandate, the share of visits with fluoride varnish increased by 9.22 (95% CI, 5.41-13.02) percentage points. This increase was observed in clinicians who treated children with insurance that was mostly mixed and mostly private; no substantial change was observed among those treating children with mostly public insurance. In this cohort study of pediatric primary care clinicians, an association between the ACA mandate and an increase in fluoride varnish application was observed, especially among clinicians primarily treating privately insured patients and those applying it premandate. However, application remains infrequent, suggesting persistent barriers.",

However, similar to HIV infection of humans, developing a vaccine that protects macaques from infection following pathogenic SIV(MAC251) challenge has proven difficult, and current vaccine candidates at best, only reduce viral loads after infection. Here we demonstrate that prior infection with a chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) containing an HIV envelope gene confers protection against intravenous infection with the heterologous, highly pathogenic SIV(MAC251) in rhesus macaques. Although definitive immune correlates of protection were not identified, preservation and\/or restoration of intestinal CD4(+) memory T cells were associated with protection from challenge and control of viremia. These results suggest that protection against pathogenic lentiviral infection or disease progression is indeed possible, and may correlate with preservation of mucosal CD4(+) T cells.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) can be a cause of previously diagnosed cryptogenic stroke. However, AF can be paroxysmal and asymptomatic, thereby making detection with routine ECG methods difficult. Oral anticoagulation is highly effective in reducing recurrent stroke in patients with AF, but its initiation is dependent on the detection of AF. Cryptogenic Stroke and Underlying Atrial Fibrillation (CRYSTAL AF) is the first randomized study to report the detection of AF in cryptogenic stroke patients using continuous long-term monitoring via insertable cardiac monitors (ICM).\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nPatients with prior cryptogenic stroke were randomized to control (n=220) or ICM (n=221) and followed for \u226436 months. Cumulative AF detection rates in the ICM arm increased progressively during this period (3.7%, 8.9%, 12.4%, and 30.0% at 1, 6, 12, and 36 months, respectively), but remained low in the control arm (3.0% at 36 months). This resulted in oral anticoagulation prescription in 94.7% of ICM patients with AF detected at 6 months, 96.6% at 12 months, and 90.5% at 36 months. Among ICM patients with AF detected, the median time to AF detection was 8.4 months, 81.0% of first AF episodes were asymptomatic, and 94.9% had at least 1 day with >6 minutes of AF.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThree-year monitoring by ICM in cryptogenic stroke patients demonstrated a significantly higher AF detection rate compared with routine care. Given the frequency of asymptomatic first episodes and the long median time to detection, these findings highlight the limitations of using traditional AF detection methods. The majority of patients with AF were prescribed oral anticoagulation therapy.\n\n\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT00924638.",

        "abstract":"Area MT is a visuotopically organized area in extrastriate cortex of primates that appears to be specialized for the analysis of visual motion. To examine the full extent and topographic organization of the subcortical projections of MT in the macaque, we injected tritiated amino acids in five cynomolgus monkeys and processed the brains for autoradiography. The injection sites, which we identified electrophysiologically, ranged from the representation of central through peripheral vision in both the upper and lower visual fields and included, collectively, most of MT. Projections from MT to the superior colliculus are topographically organized and in register with projections from striate cortex to the colliculus. Unlike projections from striate cortex, those from MT are not limited to the upper layer of the stratum griseum superficiale but rather extend ventrally from the upper through the lower layer of the stratum griseum superficiale and even include the stratum opticum. Projections from MT to the pulvinar are organized into three separate fields. One field (P1) is located primarily in the inferior pulvinar but extends into a portion of the adjacent lateral pulvinar. The second field (P2) partially surrounds the first and is located entirely in the lateral pulvinar. The third and heaviest projection field (P3) is located posteromedially in the inferior pulvinar but also includes small portions of the lateral and medial pulvinar that lie dorsal to the brachium of the superior colliculus. While projections from MT to P1 and P2 are topographically organized, there appears to be a convergence of MT inputs to P3. Projections from MT to the reticular nucleus of the thalamus are located in the ventral portion of the nucleus, approximately at the level of the caudal pulvinar. There was some evidence that MT sites representing central vision project more caudally than do those representing peripheral vision. Projections from MT to the caudate, putamen, and claustrum are localized to small, limited zones in each structure. Those to the caudate terminate within the most caudal portion of the body and the tail. Similarly, projections to the putamen are always to its most caudal portion, where the structure appears as nuclear islands. Projections to the claustrum are located ventrally, approximately at the level of the anterior part of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. Projections from MT to the pons terminate rostrally in the dorsolateral nucleus, the lateral nucleus, and the dorsolateral portion of the peduncular nucleus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Data were obtained from systematic recordings of interventions by clinicians and from medical record abstraction.\n\n\nSETTING\nSix inpatient rehabilitation programs.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nPatients (N=1376) with traumatic SCI admitted for initial rehabilitation.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nNot applicable.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nFactors recorded as impacting the objective or content of treatment sessions by physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and therapeutic recreation, patients' participation in treatment as rated using a modified Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale (PRPS), length of stay (LOS), medical morbidity measured using the Comprehensive Severity Index, hours of therapy per week, and missed therapy minutes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients received 151,172 treatment sessions from 483 therapists. Pain, fatigue, and spasticity were commonly reported factors; other medical, behavioral, and logistical factors were also frequent, with 30% of sessions being affected by at least 1 factor. The number of factors was correlated with missed therapy minutes and with the PRPS score. Patients with more reported factors, overall or per average session, had a longer LOS and fewer hours of treatment per week.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMedical and other factors complicating therapy are common. Those who need a longer stay because of their injury level or for other reasons have more opportunity to have sessions affected, but having many treatment sessions impacted by 1 or more factors also is likely to increase LOS.

To determine whether synaptically released glutamate activates KARs, we recorded excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in the GP following single-pulse stimulation of the internal capsule. 4-(8-Methyl-9H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5 h]{2,3}benzodiazepine-5-yl)-benzenamine hydrochloride (GYKI 52466, 100 microm), an alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist, reduced but did not completely block evoked EPSCs. The remaining EPSC component was mediated through activation of KARs because it was abolished by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione (CNQX), an AMPA\/KAR antagonist. The rise time (10-90%) and decay time constant (tau) for those EPSCs were longer than those of AMPA-mediated EPSCs recorded before GYKI 52466 application. KAR activation inhibited EPSCs. This inhibition was associated with a significant increase in paired-pulse facilitation ratio, suggesting a presynaptic action of KAR. KAR inhibition of EPSCs was blocked by the G-protein inhibitor, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), or the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor calphostin C. Our results demonstrate that KAR activation has dual effects on glutamatergic transmission in the rat GP: (1) it mediates small-amplitude EPSCs; and (2) it reduces glutamatergic synaptic transmission through a presynaptic G-protein coupled, PKC-dependent, metabotropic mechanism. These findings provide evidence for the multifarious functions of KARs in regulating synaptic transmission, and open up the possibility for the development of pharmacotherapies to reduce the hyperactive subthalamofugal projection in Parkinson's disease.",

        "abstract":"Cyt1Aa is a cytolytic toxin, found together with the delta-endotoxins in Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis parasporal insecticidal crystals. The latter are used as an environmental friendly insecticide against mosquitoes and black flies. Contrary to Cry delta-endotoxin, the mode of action of Cyt1Aa is not completely understood. In the absence of direct structural data, a novel mutated cyt1Aa gene was used to obtain indirect informations on Cyt1Aa conformation changes in the lipid membrane environment. A mutated cyt1Aa gene named cyt1A97 has been isolated from a B. thuringiensis israelensis strain named BUPM97. The nucleotide sequence predicted a protein of 249 amino acids residues with a calculated molecular mass of 27 kDa. Both nucleotide and amino acid sequences similarity analysis revealed that cyt1A97 presents one amino acid different from the native cyt1Aa gene. This mutation was located in the helix alpha C corresponding to a substitution of Met(115) by a Thr. The heterologous expression of the cyt1A97 and another cyt1Aa-type gene called cyt1A98, not affected by such mutation used as control, was performed in Escherichia coli. It revealed that the mutated Cyt1A97 protein was over produced as inclusion bodies showing a very weak toxicity to E. coli contrarily to Cyt1A98 that stopped E. coli growth. Hence, hydrophobic residue Met at position 115 of Cyt1Aa should play a very important role for the maintenance of the structure and cytolytic functions of Cyt1Aa.",

        "abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on lipid levels in adult epilepsy patients. We retrospectively reviewed blood data of 5053 patients with epilepsy (aged 20-94 years) and divided them into 3 groups: non AED group (without AED treatment), non-inducer group (using non-inducer AEDs), and inducer group (taking inducer AEDs; phenytoin (PHT), phenobarbital (PB), and carbamazepine (CBZ)). As a marker of dyslipidemia, the level of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) was calculated by subtracting HDL-cholesterol from total cholesterol. The mean non-HDL-C level of non AED group, non-inducer group, and inducer group was 124, 130, and 138mg\/dL, respectively. In inducer group, patients using CBZ had a higher non-HDL-C level than patients taking PHT or PB. When a non-HDL-C level exceeding 180mg\/dL was defined as dyslipidemia, use of CBZ was associated with a significantly higher risk of dyslipidemia (adjusted odds ratio (OR); 2.6: 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.8-3.8) in comparison with non AED group. Use of valproic acid (VPA) was also associated with a higher non-HDL-C level (OR; 2.1: 95% CI: 1.4-3.2). An elevated non-HDL-C level was associated with increasing age, increasing BMI, and male gender, and use of inducers enhanced the risk of dyslipidemia. We recommend routine monitoring of the non-HDL-C level when using VPA and inducers, especially CBZ. While CBZ and VPA are first-line AEDs, medication should be selected by considering risk factors for dyslipidemia, such as age gender, and obesity.",

        "abstract":"This study illustrates how retention models can be used to accurately predict the retention behaviour of polydisperse macromolecules in LC separations. It highlights that the number of experiments required can be drastically reduced when the relationship between the model parameters and molecular structure parameters (e.g. molar mass) can be incorporated into one global model. A practical implication of this work is that an appropriate model can then be used for the determination of molar-mass distributions for polydisperse samples. The globalised model can predict retention time as a function of molar mass and gradient slope. Both the original and globalised versions of the model were rigorously validated in terms of the difference between the predicted and experimental retention times. The original model had very low residuals and there was no apparent dependence of the errors on the applied gradient, the molar mass or the retention times. Confidence intervals for the model parameters (S and ln k0) were determined using a bootstrapping analysis of the residual errors in the predicted retention times. Confidence intervals were seen to broaden significantly as the mass of the polymer increased. The parameters were also seen to be highly correlated. For the global model, retention-time residuals remained quite low, even when the number of experiments used to determine the model parameters was reduced from approximately 100 to 10.",

        "abstract":"In order to load a muscle optimally during resistance exercise, it should be heavily taxed throughout the entire range of motion for that exercise. However, traditional constant resistance squats only tax the lower-extremity muscles to their limits at the \"sticking region\" or a critical joint configuration of the exercise cycle. Therefore, a linear motion (Smith) exercise machine was modified with pneumatics and appropriate computer control so that it could be capable of adjusting force to control velocity within a repetition of the squat exercise or other exercise performed with the device. Prior to application of this device in a dynamic squat setting, the maximum voluntary isometric force (MVIF) produced over a spectrum of knee angles is needed. This would reveal the sticking region and overall variation in strength capacity. Five incremental knee angles (90, 110, 130, 150, and 170 degrees, where 180 degrees defined full extension) were examined. After obtaining university-approved informed consent, 12 men and 12 women participated in the study. The knee angle was set, and the pneumatic cylinder was pressurized such that the subject could move the barbell slightly but no more than two-centimeters. The peak pressure exerted over a five-second maximum effort interval was recorded at each knee angle in random order and then repeated. The average of both efforts was then utilized for further analysis. The sticking region occurred consistently at a 90 degrees knee angle, however, the maximum force produced varied between 110 degrees and 170 degrees with the greatest frequency at 150 degrees for both men and women. The percent difference between the maximum and minimum MVIF was 46% for men and 57% for women.",

        "abstract":"Over the past two decades, gene therapy has garnered tremendous attention and is heralded by many as the ultimate cure to treat diseases such as cancer, viral infections, and inherited genetic disorders. However, the therapeutic applications of nucleic acids extend beyond the delivery of double-stranded DNA and subsequent expression of deficient gene products in diseased tissue. Other strategies include antisense oligonucleotides and most notably RNA interference (RNAi). Antisense strategies bear great potential for the treatment of diseases that are caused by misspliced mRNA, and RNAi is a universal and extraordinarily efficient tool to knock down the expression of virtually any gene by specific degradation of the desired target mRNA. However, because of the hurdles associated with effective delivery of nucleic acids across a cell membrane, the initial euphoria surrounding siRNA therapy soon subsided. The ability of oligonucleotides to cross the plasma membrane is hampered by their size and highly negative charge. Viral vectors have long been the gold standard to overcome this barrier, but they are associated with severe immunogenic effects and possible tumorigenesis. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), cationic peptides that can translocate through the cell membrane independent of receptors and can transport cargo including proteins, small organic molecules, nanoparticles, and oligonucleotides, represent a promising class of nonviral delivery vectors. This Account focuses on peptide carrier systems for the cellular delivery of various types of therapeutic nucleic acids with a special emphasis on cell-penetrating peptides. We also emphasize the clinical relevance of this research through examples of promising in vivo studies. Although CPPs are often derived from naturally occurring protein transduction domains, they can also be artificially designed. Because CPPs typically include many positively charged amino acids, those electrostatic interactions facilitate the formation of complexes between the carriers and the oligonucleotides. One drawback of CPP-mediated delivery includes entrapment of the cargo in endosomes because uptake tends to be endocytic: coupling of fatty acids or endosome-disruptive peptides to the CPPs can overcome this problem. CPPs can also lack specificity for a single cell type, which can be addressed through the use of targeting moieties, such as peptide ligands that bind to specific receptors. Researchers have also applied these strategies to cationic carrier systems for nonviral oligonucleotide delivery, such as liposomes or polymers, but CPPs tend to be less cytotoxic than other delivery vehicles.",

However, it turned out that the results suffer from a comparably poor signal-to-noise ratio. The reason is that the limited coherent electron current, given by gun brightness, has to illuminate a width of at least four times the point-spread function given by the aberrations. As, using the hardware corrector, the point-spread function shrinks considerably, the current density increases and the signal-to-noise ratio improves correspondingly. Furthermore, the phase shift at the atomic dimensions found in the image plane also increases because the collection efficiency of the optics increases with resolution. In total, the signals of atomically fine structures are better defined for quantitative evaluation. In fact, the results achieved by electron holography in a Tecnai F20 Cs-corr TEM confirm this.",

        "title":"Differential roles of Bcl2L12 and its short variant in breast cancer lymph node metastasis.",
        "abstract":"Bcl2L12 plays a role in post-mitochondrial apoptosis through multiple mechanisms involving p53, \u03b1B-crystallin, caspase-3 and -7 in glioblastoma. Bcl2L12 is reported to be a good prognostic marker in breast cancer and correlated with ER and Bcl2 expression status. However, the mechanisms by which Bcl2L12 regulates apoptosis in breast cancer (BCa) remain unknown. Recent studies have shown that Bcl2L12 expression is a useful biomarker in other types of cancer. Thus, we examined whether Bcl2L12 and Bcl2L12A mRNA were associated with breast cancer progression or a specific subtype. In total, 106 paraffin-embedded, different stage breast cancer specimens were prepared and quantified for Bcl2L12 and Bcl2L12A expression by PCR. The correlation between Bcl2L12 and Bcl2L12A mRNA levels and clinicopathological characteristics was statistically analyzed. The results showed that Bcl2L12 and Bcl2L12A mRNA expression was not significantly different across the different stage, grade and TNM classification groups (P>0.005). Using linear regression, Bcl2L12 mRNA was associated with Bcl2L12A mRNA, grade 3 tumor and the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype. In non-TNBC specimens, Bcl2L12 mRNA was only correlated with Bcl2L12A mRNA. Bcl2L12A mRNA was positively associated with Bcl2L12 mRNA and the number of lymph node metastases, but negatively correlated with staging in the non-TNBC group. Specifically, Bcl2L12, but not Bcl2L12A, mRNA was significantly higher in TNBC and grade 3 tumors, respectively. In non-TNBC, Bcl2L12A mRNA was significantly highly expressed in tumors with \u2265 12 metastatic lymph nodes. Bcl2L12 and its variant mRNA were highly expressed in carcinoma in situ (CIS) samples. In addition, they were estimated to be correlated with the total sample and non-TNBC, but not the TNBC group. In summary, a high Bcl2L12 mRNA expression was associated with the high-grade BCa and TNBC subtype. In addition, the interplay between Bcl2L12 and its variant may be associated with high lymph node metastasis in non-TNBC tumors.",

        "abstract":"We present a statistical analysis of nearshore waves observed during two major North-East Atlantic storms in 2015 and 2017. Surface elevations were measured with a 5-beam acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) at relatively shallow waters off the west coast of Ireland. To compensate for the significant variability of both sea states in time, we consider a novel approach for analyzing the non-stationary surface-elevation series and compare the distributions of crest and wave heights observed with theoretical predictions based on the Forristall, Tayfun and Boccotti models. In particular, the latter two models have been largely applied to and validated for deep-water waves. We show here that they also describe well the characteristics of waves observed in relatively shallow waters. The largest nearshore waves observed during the two storms do not exceed the rogue thresholds as the Draupner, Andrea, Killard or El Faro rogue waves do in intermediate or deep-water depths. Nevertheless, our analysis reveals that modulational instabilities are ineffective, third-order resonances negligible and the largest waves observed here have characteristics quite similar to those displayed by rogue waves for which second order bound nonlinearities are the principal factor that enhances the linear dispersive focusing of extreme waves.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of parity on uterine involution and resumption of ovarian activity in Chinese Holstein dairy cows after calving under similar postpartum nutritional conditions. Traits of the status of uterus and ovaries detected by ultrasonography, dry matter intake (DMI), milk yield, body condition score (BCS), and estradiol concentration in milk samples were analyzed for 46 Chinese Holstein dairy cows in various parities (primiparous=18; biparous=13; multiparous=15). The results showed that there was no significant difference for DMI, BCS, and milk yield among different parities; all cows were considered to be under similar nutritional conditions. Days of the previous gravid uterine horn involution were significantly greater in primiparous dairy cows than in biparous and multiparous dairy cows. Days from calving to ovulation (first and second) and the number of follicular waves to first ovulation were significantly greater in primiparous cows than in multiparous cows. In summary, there was a significant negative relationship between parity and postpartum uterine involution and resumption of ovarian activity in Chinese Holstein cows under similar body conditions.",

        "abstract":"The objective of this study is to establish a framework for analyzing infrastructure dynamics affecting the long-term steady state, and hence resilience in civil infrastructure systems. To this end, a multi-agent simulation model was created to capture important phenomena affecting the dynamics of coupled human-infrastructure systems and model the long-term performance regimes of infrastructure. The proposed framework captures the following three factors that shape the dynamics of coupled human-infrastructure systems: (i) engineered physical infrastructure; (ii) human actors; and (iii) chronic and acute stressors. A complex system approach was adopted to examine the long-term resilience of infrastructure based on the understanding of performance regimes, as well as tipping points at which shifts in the performance regime of infrastructure occur under the impact of external stressors and\/or change in internal dynamics. The application of the proposed framework is demonstrated in a case of urban water distribution infrastructure using the data from a numerical case study network. The developed multi-agent simulation model was then used in examining the system resilience over a 100-year horizon under stressors such as population change and funding constraints. The results identified the effects of internal dynamics and external stressors on the resilience landscape of infrastructure systems. Furthermore, the results also showed the capability of the framework in capturing and simulating the underlying mechanisms affecting human-infrastructure dynamics, as well as long-term regime shifts and tipping point behaviors. Therefore, the integrated framework proposed in this paper enables building complex system-based theories for a more advanced understanding of civil infrastructure resilience.",

        "abstract":"PURPOSE\nIt may be possible to restore accommodation to presbyopic human eyes by refilling the lens capsular bag with a soft polymer. In the present study, optical changes were measured that occurred in a pig eye model after the refilling of the capsular bag.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe optical power and spherical aberration in 10 isolated pig lenses were measured under different conditions. They were first determined by using a scanning laser ray-tracing technique over an effective pupil size of 6 mm. Second, the contours of the anterior and posterior lens surface were photographed, and a mathematical ray-tracing was performed by using a polynomial fit through the digitized surface contours, to determine optical power and spherical aberration. Third, the lenses were refilled with a silicone oil until their preoperative lens thickness was reached, and scanning laser ray-tracing, contour photography, and mathematical ray-tracing were repeated. Comparisons between the measurements were made to determine how the change from a gradient refractive index to a homogeneous refractive index influenced spherical aberration. The influence of the change in lens contour on spherical aberration after lens refilling was also studied.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe natural lenses had a higher lens power than the refilled lenses (49.9 +\/- 1.5 D vs. 36.8 +\/- 1.5 D; P < 0.001). Moreover, there was a change in sign from negative spherical aberration before lens refilling (-3.6 D) to positive spherical aberration after lens refilling (7.9 D; P < 0.001). The comparison between scanning laser ray-tracing of the natural lens and mathematical ray-tracing of the photographed surface contours of the natural lens to determine the effect of refractive index substitution (i.e., replacement of a gradient refractive index by a homogeneous refractive index) showed a significant change in spherical aberration from -3.6 +\/- 2.0 to 11.0 +\/- 2.1 D (P < 0.001). The change in lens contour did not result in a significant change in spherical aberration (P = 0.08) before and after lens refilling with an equal refractive index.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe lower lens power of refilled pig lenses compared to natural lenses was due to the lower refractive index of the refill material. Refilling pig lenses with the silicone oil used in this study resulted in an increase in spherical aberration. This increase was mainly caused by the change from a gradient refractive index to a homogeneous refractive index. The change in lens curvature after lens refilling did not result in an increase in spherical aberration. The influence of lens refilling on spherical aberration of human lenses must be determined in similar experiments in human eyes.",

        "abstract":"Intensive use of agrochemicals is considered one of the major threats for soil quality. In an attempt to mitigate their side-effects on non-target organisms and soil functioning, many engineering and biological remediation methodologies are currently available. Among them, the use of biochar, a carbonaceous material produced from pyrolysing biomass, represents an attractive option enhancing both remediation and soil carbon storage potentials. Currently, activation of biochar with chemical or physical agents seeks for improving its remediation potential, but most of them have some undesirable drawbacks such as high costs and generation of chemical wastes. Alternatively, the use of biological procedures to activate biochar with extracellular enzymes is gaining acceptance mainly due to its eco-friendly nature and cost-effectiveness. In these strategies, microorganisms play a key role as a source of extracellular enzymes, which are retained on the biochar surface. Recently, several studies point out that soil macrofauna (earthworms) may act as a biological vector facilitating the adsorption of enzymes on biochar. This paper briefly introduces current biochar bioactivation methodologies and the mechanisms underlying the coating of biochar with enzymes. We then propose a new conceptual model using earthworms to activate biochar with extracellular enzymes. This new earthworm-biochar model can be used as a theoretical framework to produce a new product \"vermichar\", vermicompost produced from blended feedstock, earthworms, and biochar that can be used to improve soil quality and remove soil contaminants. This model can also be used to develop innovative in-situ \"vermiremediation\" technologies utilizing the beneficial effects of both earthworms and biochar. Since biochar may contain toxic chemicals generated during its production stages or later concentrated when applied to polluted soils, this paper also highlights the need for an ecotoxicological knowledge around earthworm-biochar interaction, promoting further discussion on suitable procedures for assessing the environmental risk of this conceptual model application in soil bioremediation.",

        "abstract":"Inflammatory leukocytes play a central role in the pathogenesis of human atherosclerotic disease, from early atherogenesis to the late stages of atherosclerosis, such as aneurysm formation. We have shown previously that human abdominal aortic aneurysms are characterized by the presence of numerous chronic inflammatory cells throughout the vessel wall (Am J Pathol 1990, 137: 1199-1213). The signals that attract lymphocytes and monocytes into the aortic wall in aneurysmal disease remain to be precisely defined. We have studied the production of the chemotactic cytokines interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) by aortic tissues obtained from 47 subjects. We compared the antigenic production of these cytokines by explants of: 1) human abdominal aneurysmal tissue, 2) occlusive (atherosclerotic) aortas, and 3) normal aortas. IL-8, which is chemotactic for neutrophils, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells was liberated in greater quantities by abdominal aortic aneurysms than by occlusive or normal aortas. Using immunohistochemistry, macrophages, and to a lesser degree endothelial cells, were found to be positive for the expression of antigenic IL-8. Similarly, MCP-1, a potent chemotactic cytokine for monocytes\/macrophages, was released by explants from abdominal aortic aneurysms in greater quantities than by explants from occlusive or normal aortas. Using immunohistochemistry, the predominant MCP-1 antigen-positive cells were macrophages and to a lesser extent smooth muscle cells. Our results indicate that human abdominal aortic aneurysms produce IL-8 and MCP-1, both of which may serve to recruit additional inflammatory cells into the abdominal aortic wall, hence perpetuating the inflammatory reaction that may result in the pathology of vessel wall destruction and aortic aneurysm formation.",

We set out to evaluate the suggested mechanism via an innovative application of the well-established illusory conjunction paradigm. Two hundred participants were recruited by utilizing a psychopathic-trait-maximization technique, sampling individuals from an ex-prisoner and a population sample. We found no support for information integration deficits in psychopathic individuals (BF\u2081\u2080 = 0.156), and the absence of a relationship between psychopathic traits and illusory conjunctions remained when accounting for confounding variables. These findings question the mechanism proposed by the Impaired Integration theory and pave the way for future research to advance our understanding of psychopathic trait etiology by assessing specific and falsifiable mechanisms thought to bring about the observed cognitive and behavioral deficits.

        "abstract":"Doxorubicin (DOX) is a well-known cytotoxic agent used extensively as a chemotherapeutic drug to eradicate a wide variety of human cancers. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative stress during DOX treatment can induce cardiac, renal, and hepatic toxicities, which can constrain its use as a potential cytotoxic agent. The present work investigates the antioxidant potential of naringenin (NAR) against DOXinduced toxicities of a Dalton's lymphoma ascites (DLA) tumor-bearing mouse model. Mice were randomized into four groups: a negative control, positive control, DOX (2.5 mg\/kg) treated, and DOX (2.5 mg\/kg) + NAR (50 mg\/kg\/d) treated. DOX administration significantly altered the levels of functional markers in blood and antioxidant enzymes in kidney, heart, lung, liver, spleen, and tumor tissues. These changes in antioxidant enzymes and successive lipid peroxidation were prevented by NAR supplementation, resulting in decreases in the risk of toxicity due to DOX therapy. Histopathology results and electron paramagnetic resonance imaging (EPRI) of the tumor microenvironment confirmed this evidence. Using EPRI, pharmacokinetics of the nitroxide, 3-carbamoyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine-1-oxyl (3-CP) was monitored intratumorally before and after chemotherapy. EPRI of the DOX + NAR-treated mouse model showed reduced tumor size with significant modification of the hypoxic condition inside the tumor microenvironment. Consequently, these findings suggest that NAR treatment significantly reduces DOX-induced toxicity and the hypoxic condition in a DLA tumor-bearing mouse model.",

        "abstract":"Multiferroic materials have attracted great interest because of their underlying new science and promising applications in data storage and mutual control devices. However, they are still very rare and highly imperative to be developed. Here, we report an organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite trimethylchloromethylammonium chromium chloride (TMCM-CrCl3), showing the coexistence of magnetic and electric orderings. It displays a paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition at 397 K with an Aizu notation of 6\/mFm, and spin-canted antiferromagnetic ordering with a N\u00e9el temperature of 4.8 K. The ferroelectricity originates from the orientational ordering of TMCM cations, and the magnetism is from the [CrCl3]- framework. Remarkably, TMCM-CrCl3 is the first experimentally confirmed divalent Cr2+-based multiferroic material as far as we know. A new category of hybrid multiferroic materials is pointed out in this work, and more Cr2+-based multiferroic materials will be expectedly developed in the future.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND\nInfection by the canine heartworm, Dirofilaria immitis, causes significant cardiopulmonary disease, with progression impacted by increasing parasite numbers and duration of infection. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is an important mediator of cardiac and pulmonary disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mitigates the maladaptive effects of angiotensin II by converting it to angiotensin (1-7). We hypothesized that circulating ACE2 activity would be altered in dogs with high heartworm infection intensities relative to dogs without heartworms.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFrozen serum samples (-80\u00a0\u00b0C) from 30 dogs euthanized at Florida shelters were analyzed for ACE2 activity using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry\/mass spectroscopy and a kinetics approach with and without an ACE2 inhibitor. A convenience sample of 15 dogs without heartworms (HW0) and 15 dogs with\u2009>\u200950 heartworms (HW>50) was included. Heartworm number and microfilariae presence were determined at necropsy. The effects of heartworm status, body weight, and sex on ACE2 were evaluated using regression analysis. Values of P\u2009<\u20090.05 were considered significant.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll HW0 dogs were D. immitis microfilariae-negative and all HW>50 dogs were D. immitis microfilariae-positive with a median adult worm count of 74 (minimum\u2009=\u200963, maximum\u2009=\u2009137). The ACE2 activity of HW>50 dogs (median\u2009=\u200928.2\u00a0ng\/ml; minimum\u2009=\u200913.6, maximum\u2009=\u200976.2) was not different from HW0 dogs (median 31.9\u00a0ng\/ml; minimum\u2009=\u200914.1, maximum\u2009=\u2009139.1; P\u2009=\u20090.53). The ACE2 activity was higher in dogs with high body weight (median 34.2\u00a0ng\/ml minimum\u2009=\u200914.1, maximum\u2009=\u200976.2) than in dogs with low weight (median 27.5\u00a0ng\/ml; minimum\u2009=\u200916.4, maximum\u2009=\u2009139.1; P\u2009=\u2009.044).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHeartworm infection did not impact ACE2 activity in shelter dogs with or without heartworms, but heavier dogs had higher ACE2 activity compared to lighter dogs. Comprehensive RAAS evaluation and additional clinical information would aid in understanding how ACE2 activity relates to the entire cascade and clinical status in dogs with heartworm disease.",

Then, normal NRCMs or impaired NRCMs were treated with chosen concentrations of AC alone or in combination with Rg1 for 1 h, and the cellular activity, cellular ultrastructure, apoptosis, leakage of acid phosphatase (ACP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), intracellular sodium ions [Na+], potassium ions [K+] and calcium ions [Ca2+] levels, and Nav1.5, Kv4.2, and RyR2 genes expressions in each group were examined.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor normal NRCMs, 3000 \u00b5 mol\/L AC significantly inhibited cell viability (P<0.01), promoted cell apoptosis, and damaged cell structures (P<0.05), while other doses of AC lower than 3000 \u00b5 mol\/L and the combinations of AC and Rg1 had little toxicity on NRCMs. Compared with AC acting on NRCMs alone, the co-treatment of 3000 and 10 \u00b5 mol\/L AC with 1 \u00b5 mol\/L Rg1 significantly decreased the level of intracellular Ca2+ (P<0.01 or P<0.05), and the co-treatment of 3000 \u00b5 mol\/L AC with 1 \u00b5 mol\/L Rg1 significantly decreased the level of intracellular Ca2+ via regulating Nav1.5, RyR2 expression (P<0.01).

However, information is lacking about how the precision of these restorations is affected by the fabrication procedures.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nThe purpose of this in\u00a0vitro study was to evaluate the influence of different fabrication techniques on the marginal precision of PEEK single-crown copings.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nA stainless-steel master die was designed to simulate a prepared mandibular second molar to receive ceramic crowns. Thirty PEEK copings were fabricated and divided into 3 groups (n=10) according to the fabrication technique: milled from a prefabricated PEEK blank by using a computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) system (PC); pressed from prefabricated PEEK pellets (PP); and pressed from PEEK granules (PG); in addition, 3-mol yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (3Y-TZP) copings (n=10) were produced by using the same CAD-CAM system and served as a control. Marginal precision measurements (in \u03bcm) were recorded at 4 reference points on each coping by using a digital microscope. The data obtained were statistically analyzed by using 1-way ANOVA and the pair-wise Tukey (HSD) test to study the difference between group mean values (\u03b1=.05).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe overall mean \u00b1standard deviation marginal gap at the marginal opening for the copings was 78 \u00b110 \u03bcm for PEEK granules copings, 72 \u00b19 \u03bcm for PEEK pellet copings, 45 \u00b16 \u03bcm for PEEK CAD-CAM copings, and 43 \u00b11 \u03bcm for the 3Y-TZP CAD-CAM control. A statistically significant difference was found between the milled and pressed copings as indicated by the ANOVA test (P<.001). The pair-wise Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) test showed a nonsignificant difference (P>.05) between milled 3Y-TZP and milled PEEK copings; moreover, no significant difference was observed between the PEEK copings pressed from pellets or granules (P>.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe marginal precision of PEEK CAD-CAM-fabricated copings showed significantly lower mean marginal gap values than PEEK pressed copings. The marginal gap mean values recorded were all within a clinically acceptable range (120 \u03bcm).",

Increased incidence of narcolepsy was detected following the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and linked to Pandemrix vaccination, strongly supporting that narcolepsy is an autoimmune disorder. Although recent results suggest CD4+\u2009T cell reactivity to neuropeptide hypocretin\/orexin and cross-reactive flu peptide is involved, identification of other autoantigens has remained elusive. Here we study whether autoimmunity directed against Regulatory Factor X4 (RFX4), a protein co-localized with hypocretin, is involved in some cases of narcolepsy. Studying human serum, we found that autoantibodies against RFX4 were rare. Using RFX4 peptides bound to DQ0602 tetramers, antigen RFX4-86, -95, and -60 specific human CD4+\u2009T cells were detected in 4\/10 patients and 2 unaffected siblings, but not in others. Following culture with each cognate peptide, enriched autoreactive TCR\u03b1\u03b2 clones were isolated by single-cell sorting and TCR sequenced. Homologous clones bearing TRBV4-2 and recognizing RFX4-86 in patients and one twin control of patient were identified.

Currently, various prosthesis types are available. Atrioventricular block (AVB) requiring pacemaker (PM) implantation is a typical complication after TAVI. This study investigated the recovery of AV node conduction and mid-term outcome of patients with or without PM implantation after TAVI according to prosthesis type.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFrom July 2008 to May 2015, 856 transcatheter heart valves were implanted at our center (age: 80.5\u00b16.1 years; logistic EuroSCORE: 15.4%). These patients were followed up regularly in our outpatient clinic.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPM implantation was performed in 16.9% of patients due to severe conduction disturbances, mainly third-degree AVB. The need for PM implantation differed between the various prosthesis types: Medtronic CoreValve (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA): 22.8% (n=272), Edwards Sapien XT (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA): 13.0% (n=262), Edwards Sapien 3 (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA): 16.2% (n=234), Direct Flow Medical (Direct Flow Medical, Santa Rosa, CA, USA): 7.3% (n=41), St. Jude Medical Portico (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN, USA): 15.4% (n=26), Boston Scientific Lotus (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA): 21.4% (n=14) and Medtronic Evolut R (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA): 14.3% (n=7). Kaplan-Meier analysis for all-cause mortality did not reveal any differences between the various prosthesis types. PM implantation rates declined over the years of experience in a stable intervention team; 45% of PM patients showed sufficient AV node conduction after PM reprogramming at our follow-up examination.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMid-term all-cause survival after TAVI seems to be independent of prosthesis type and PM implantation after TAVI. Intrinsic AV node conduction recovers in a significant proportion of patients. Therefore, regular PM interrogations including reprogramming are required to avoid unnecessary permanent right ventricular stimulation.",

        "abstract":"Host-guest chemistry, particularly of supramolecules, has been an intriguing topic for researchers for a long time due to its multiplicative applications ranging from chemical to biological to materials science. Supramolecules, such as calixarenes, are excellent host molecular systems due to their controllable cavity along with the ease of functionalization both at the lower and upper rims. The host-guest interactions involving calixarenes have been primarily studied using physical methods, such as absorption, fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry and mass spectrometry. The corresponding literature as disseminated through review articles triggered broadening of the spectrum of research. Depending upon the nature of the derivatization, the supramolecular conjugates of calixarenes have been shown to form different morphologies of micro and nanometric size as reported in the literature. Pertinent research performed in our own group was based on atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy studies. The literature reveals that such morphologies are modified in the presence of guest species. Thus, the supramolecular host-guest complexation of calixarenes leading to the formation of various architectures has been studied using both spectroscopy and microscopy techniques to obtain complimentary data. However, there are no review articles that provide discussions on this exciting area of supramolecular science involving microscopy. Therefore, in the present article, for the first time, we have brought together the research reported in the literature during the past decade, including ours, in demonstrating the supramolecular architectures formed from the host-guest interactions extended by the conjugates of calixarenes, and their applications using microscopy. The scope of this article spans across various features of interaction in these systems: (i) in solution, (ii) at the air-water interface and (iii) on solid surfaces. The application domain includes sensing of organic explosives and drugs, exhibiting antibacterial activity, supramolecular self-assembly or co-assembly resulting in gels, micelles and vesicles, and the consequent aggregation-induced emission and a few others.",

Synchronies and oscillations are thought to subserve many possible functions: sensation, perception, action, cognition, motivation, affect, memory, attention, anticipation, and imagination. These include direct involvement in coding attributes of events and objects through phase-locking as well as characteristic patterns of spike latency and oscillatory response. They are thought to be involved in segmentation and binding, working memory, attention, gating and routing of signals, temporal reset mechanisms, inter-regional coordination, time discretization, time-warping transformations, and support for temporal wave-interference based operations. A high level, partial taxonomy of neural codes consists of channel, temporal pattern, and spike latency codes. The functional roles of synchronies and oscillations in candidate neural codes, including oscillatory phase-offset codes, are outlined. Various forms of multiplexing neural signals are considered: time-division, frequency-division, code-division, oscillatory-phase, synchronized channels, oscillatory hierarchies, polychronous ensembles. An expandable, annotative neural spike train framework for encoding low- and high-level attributes of events and objects is proposed. Coding schemes require appropriate neural architectures for their interpretation. Time-delay, oscillatory, wave-interference, synfire chain, polychronous, and neural timing networks are discussed. Some novel concepts for formulating an alternative, more time-centric theory of brain function are discussed. As in radio communication systems, brains can be regarded as networks of dynamic, adaptive transceivers that broadcast and selectively receive multiplexed temporally-patterned pulse signals. These signals enable complex signal interactions that select, reinforce, and bind common subpatterns and create emergent lower dimensional signals that propagate through spreading activation interference networks. If memory traces share the same kind of temporal pattern forms as do active neuronal representations, then distributed, holograph-like content-addressable memories are made possible via temporal pattern resonances.",

        "abstract":"The ORF135 of Helicoverpa armigera single nucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearSNPV)(Ha135) is one of the 20 genes that are unique to HearSNPV. Computer-assisted analysis revealed that four potential post translation modification sites, four transcription factor associated domains and a DNA binding protein domain were found in Ha135 amino acid sequence. Northern blot analysis of Ha135 indicated that Ha135 transcript was detected at 12 h.p.i. and remained detectable at up to 122 h.p.i. RT-PCR method was used to understand the temporal regulation of the transcript at earlier stages, the result showed that the Ha135 transcript was detected as early as 3 h p.i. suggesting that Ha135 was an early gene, which is in agreement with the early promoter motifs. The Ha135 protein was also detected at 12 h.p.i and remained detectable until 122 h.p.i. by western blot using an anti-Ha135 antiserum. The product of Ha135 was found to be about 29 kDa, bigger than the predicted 24 kDa molecular weight, suggesting that post translational modification of the Ha135 protein occur in host cells. The subcellular location was studied using EGFP-Ha135, which suggested that the Ha135 protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, which is compatible with several functional domains present in Ha135 amino acid sequence. Together, these results suggest the possibility that HearSNPV ORFI35 might be involved in viral DNA transcription and\/or replication.",

        "abstract":"As radiologic technology advances, quantitative imaging is becoming more prevalent in clinical practice. This article reviews quantitative hepatic MRI, specifically involving fat and iron deposition, by demonstrating how they were iteratively improved. These iterative improvements involved incorporating more knowledge about the physiology of liver disease and MRI physics to reduce the adverse effects caused by confounding factors. The relevant foundations of MRI physics and liver pathophysiology are briefly reviewed, followed by the various improvements made by expanding on this foundational knowledge. Results from the literature are then discussed within this context, validating the improvement of these resultant methods into clinically robust and useful techniques. Fibrosis quantification, which has been more difficult to robustly perform in clinical practice, is similarly reviewed in an online appendix, with proposals for future multiparametric directions to improve performance on the basis of the insights gained from fat and iron quantification in the liver.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND\nLung eosinophilia is a hallmark of asthma, and eosinophils are believed to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammatory diseases. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, are produced in high amounts in the gastrointestinal tract by commensal bacteria and can be absorbed into the bloodstream. Although there is recent evidence that SCFAs are beneficial in allergic asthma models, the effect on eosinophils has remained elusive.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe role of SCFAs was investigated in human eosinophil function and a mouse model of allergic asthma.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEosinophils were purified from self-reported allergic or healthy donors. Migration, adhesion to the endothelium, and eosinophil survival were studied in\u00a0vitro. Ca2+ flux, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, and expression of surface markers were determined by using flow cytometry and in part by using real-time PCR. Allergic airway inflammation was assessed in\u00a0vivo in an ovalbumin-induced asthma model by using invasive spirometry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor the first time, we observed that SCFAs were able to attenuate human eosinophils at several functional levels, including (1) adhesion to the endothelium, (2) migration, and (3)\u00a0survival. These effects were independent from GPR41 and GPR43 but were accompanied by histone acetylation and mimicked by trichostatin A, a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor. In\u00a0vivo butyrate ameliorated allergen-induced airway and lung eosinophilia, reduced type 2 cytokine levels in bronchial fluid, and improved airway hyperresponsiveness in mice.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo findings highlight the importance of SCFAs, especially butyrate as a promising therapeutic agent in allergic inflammatory diseases.",

        "abstract":"In the traditional method of the bio-fabrication of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs), bacterial strains face metal toxicity and antimicrobial action. In the current study, an alkalescent nucleoside antibiotic was mixed with zinc hexanitrate to fabricate the ZnONPs. An integrated approach of DIAION HP-20 macroporous resin and sephadex LH-20 column chromatography was adopted to separate and purify alkalescent nucleoside AN03 from Streptomyces koyanogensis. Alkalescent nucleoside was confirmed by the Doskochilova solvent system. The bio-fabricated ZnONPs were characterized by using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses. The XRD spectrum and the TEM images confirmed the crystallinity and the spherical shape of the ZnONPs with an average size of 22 nm. FTIR analysis showed the presence of functional groups, which confirmed the bio-fabrication of ZnONPs from alkalescent nucleoside ANO3. In-vitro studies showed that 75 \u03bcg\/mL of ZnONPs had a strong inhibitory zone (28.39 mm) against the Magnaporthe grisea and significantly suppressed the spore germination. SEM and TEM observations respectively revealed that ZnONPs caused breakage in hyphae and could damage the cells of M. grisea. Greenhouse experiments revealed that the foliar spray of ZnONPs could control the rice blast disease by 98%. Results also revealed that ZnONPs had positive effects on the growth of the rice plant. The present study suggested that ZnONPs could be fabricated from microbe-derived nucleoside antibiotics without facing the problems of metal toxicity and antimicrobial action, thus overcoming the problem of pathogen resistance. This could be a potent biocontrol agent in rice blast disease management.",

Specifically, in subfield CA3 of AHS patients despite of a moderate preservation of neuronal cell densities the concentration of NAA was significantly lowered, while the concentrations of lactate, glucose, and succinate were elevated. We suggest that these subfield-specific alterations of metabolite concentrations in AHS are very likely caused by impairment of mitochondrial function and not related to neuronal cell loss.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA subfield-specific impairment of energy metabolism is the probable cause for lowered NAA concentrations in sclerotic hippocampi of MTLE patients.",

        "abstract":"Mitochondrial metabolism and function are modulated by changes in matrix Ca2+. Small increases in the matrix Ca2+ stimulate mitochondrial bioenergetics, whereas excessive Ca2+ leads to cell death by causing massive matrix swelling and impairing the structural and functional integrity of mitochondria. Sustained opening of the non-selective mitochondrial permeability transition pores (PTP) is the main mechanism responsible for mitochondrial Ca2+ overload that leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. Recent studies suggest the existence of two or more types of PTP, and adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) and FOF1-ATP synthase were proposed to form the PTP independent of each other. Here, we elucidated the role of ANT in PTP opening by applying both experimental and computational approaches. We first developed and corroborated a detailed model of the ANT transport mechanism including the matrix (ANTM), cytosolic (ANTC), and pore (ANTP) states of the transporter. Then, the\u00a0ANT model was incorporated into a simple, yet effective, empirical model of mitochondrial bioenergetics to ascertain the point when Ca2+ overload initiates PTP opening via an ANT switch-like mechanism activated by matrix Ca2+ and is inhibited by extra-mitochondrial ADP. We found that encoding a heterogeneous Ca2+ response of at least three types of PTPs, weakly, moderately, and strongly sensitive to Ca2+, enabled the model to simulate Ca2+ release dynamics observed after large boluses were administered to a population of energized cardiac mitochondria. Thus, this study demonstrates the potential role of ANT in PTP gating and proposes a novel mechanism governing the cryptic nature of the PTP phenomenon.",

        "abstract":"Communication in biological systems involves diverse-types of cell-cell interaction including cross-talk between receptors expressed by the target cells. Recently, novel sort of estrogen receptors (G protein - coupled estrogen receptor; GPER and estrogen-related receptor; ERR) that signal directly via estrogen binding and\/or via mutual interaction-regulated estrogen signaling were reported in various organs including testis. Peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor (PPAR) is responsible for maintaining of lipid homeostasis that is critical for sex steroid production in the testis. Here, we investigated the role of interaction between GPER, ERR\u03b2 and PPAR\u03b3 in steroidogenic Leydig cells of immature boar testis. Testicular fragments cultured ex vivo were treated with GPER or PPAR\u03b3 antagonists. Then, cell ultrastructure, expression and localization of GPER, ERR\u03b2, PPAR\u03b3 together with the molecular receptor mechanism, through cyclic AMP and Raf\/Ras\/extracellular signal activated kinases (ERK), in the control of cholesterol concentration and estrogen production by Leydig cells were studied. In the ultrastructure of antagonist-treated Leydig cells, mitochondria were not branched and not bifurcated as they were found in control. Additionally, in PPAR\u03b3-blocked Leydig cells changes in the number of lipid droplets were revealed. Independent of used antagonist, western blot revealed decreased co-expression of GPER, ERR\u03b2, PPAR\u03b3 with exception of increased expression of ERR\u03b2 after PPAR\u03b3 blockage. Immunohistochemistry confirmed presence of all receptors partially located in the nucleus or cytoplasm of Leydig cells of both control and treated testes. Changes in receptor expression, decreased cholesterol and increased estradiol tissue concentrations occurred through decreased cAMP level (with exception after GPER blockage) as well as Raf\/Ras\/ERK pathway expression. These all findings indicate that GPER-ERR\u03b2-PPAR\u03b3 interaction exists in immature boar testis and regulates Leydig cell function. Further detailed studies and considerations on GPER-ERR\u03b2-PPAR\u03b3 as possible diagnosis\/therapy target in disturbances of testis steroidogenic function are needed.",

These spectra have been subsequently simulated by assigning cross-sections and anisotropy \u03b2 values to the two SeH spin-orbit exit channels. While the SeH((2)\u03a03\/2) exit channel has a \u03b2 value close to -1 throughout the studied wavelength range, the spin-orbit excited SeH((2)\u03a01\/2) exit channel's \u03b2 value switches from near -1 to near +0.5 when the photolysis wavelength increases from 210 to 266 nm. These results have been examined in the light of available ab initio calculations. Throughout the studied wavelengths, the contribution from excitation to the 1(1)B1 state predominates and provides the source of the -1 \u03b2 value. In order to account for the +0.5 \u03b2 value, it is necessary to assume that the 2(1)A1 state as well as the 4A' and 5A' states (both originating from a (3)B1 state) also contribute at short wavelengths. More interestingly, at the longer wavelength end (266 nm), contribution of a +0.5 \u03b2 value from the 3A' state (originating from a (3)A2 state) exceeds the contribution of the -1 \u03b2 value for the SeH((2)\u03a01\/2) channel.",

        "abstract":"Allopregnanolone (3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one) is an endogenously derived metabolite of progesterone, and a potent positive modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptors. A withdrawal syndrome, characterized by central nervous system (CNS) hyperexcitability, has been demonstrated following abrupt discontinuation of high progesterone levels in rats, which was due in part to altered levels of allopregnanolone. The purpose of the present study was to determine if a single administration of pregnanolone or allopregnanolone could produce an acute withdrawal response in mice selected for susceptibility (Withdrawal Seizure-Prone, WSP) or resistance (Withdrawal Seizure-Resistant, WSR) to ethanol withdrawal convulsions. WSP mice administered 75 mg\/kg pregnanolone showed a significant increase in handling-induced convulsion (HIC) scores over a 25-h testing period. In contrast, HIC scores in WSR mice were negligible after acute administration of 25, 50, 75, or 100 mg\/kg pregnanolone. WSP mice also showed a similar increase in HIC after withdrawal from 75 mg\/kg allopregnanolone. This effect was evident at both the 10-h and 25-h overall withdrawal severity assessment. These results demonstrate that neuroactive steroids can elicit an acute withdrawal response similar to that of other positive modulators of GABA(A) receptors in WSP mice, supporting the notion that a common set of genes underlie acute and chronic withdrawal severity from multiple agents with depressant effects on the central nervous system.",

        "abstract":"PURPOSE\nThe aim was to describe a geographically and clinically diverse sample of cases of Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) and establish the risk factors for poor outcomes among patients with this disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a retrospective, population-based case series of 116 patients with AK identified through a national surveillance network. Data were collected via a medical record review by diagnosing ophthalmologists and by phone interviews with patients. Exact logistic regression modeling was used to determine risk factors for poor visual outcomes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong patients with data available on contact lens use, it was found that 93.3% wore contact lenses. The median time from symptom onset to care seeking was 2 days, whereas the median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 27 days. Keratoplasty was performed in 27 of 81 patients with available outcome data and was more likely in patients >40 years old [odds ratio (OR) 5.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49-21.92]. When adjusted for age, the risk factors for keratoplasty included the presence of a ring infiltrate (OR 40.00, 95% CI 3.58-447.0) or any sign of stromal invasion (OR 10.48, 95% CI 2.56-55.09). One-third of patients with available data on best-corrected visual acuity had a best-corrected visual acuity <20\/200, with the presence of a ring infiltrate as the only significant predictor of this outcome when adjusted for age (aOR 3.45, 95% CI 1.01-12.31).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAK remains challenging to diagnose. Consequently, patients with advanced disease are more likely to have poor outcomes, particularly if they are older. The increasing awareness of AK among general eye care providers may shorten referral times and potentially improve outcomes.",

Due to the continued increase in incidence of melanoma in Northern Ireland, we have conducted a questionnaire survey in an attempt to gather information about sunbathing habits and other forms of ultraviolet light exposure amongst the Northern Ireland population.\n\n\nAIM\nThe aim of this study was to examine the test-retest reliability of a questionnaire used in a large-scale cross-sectional population survey pertaining to sunbathing habits, use of sun screen, skin types, and frequencies of sunburn and to assess the responses given by the subjects to determine the nature of their sun-related behaviour.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThirty control subjects were randomly selected from a population control sample participating in a large case-control study investigating melanoma in the Northern Ireland population. All participants completed the interview questionnaire on two occasions, with a median of 15 days (range, 12-42 days) between interviews. We randomly chose control subjects who had been visited by the same research nurse, thus ruling out interobserver bias in the analyses. We used the test-retest method. Kappa statistics were used to calculate the association between test and retest scores of all the individual items. If the items contained within the questionnaire are reliable, then repeated measurement after a fairly short period of time should result in high within-subject repeatability.\n\n\nRESULTS\nQuestions pertaining to hours spent in the sun and sun bed usage showed high reliability (kappa > 0.7). Questions about sunscreen usage showed moderately high reliability (kappa > 0.6) in all but one of the 10-year age bands and complete agreement (kappa = 1) in one age category (>50 years).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis questionnaire is a reliable method of assessing sun-associated behaviour identifying high-risk sun-related behaviour and misconceptions about tanning, which can be targeted for improvement in public health.",

        "abstract":"Unlike children, high-grade brainstem glioma (HG-BSG) in adults is a rare and diverse group of tumors. They can be classified based on their location and physical characteristics, which distinguishes them from pediatric brainstem gliomas. They are rare in adults, constituting only 1\u00a0% to 2\u00a0% of intracranial gliomas. They are often aggressive and have a poor prognosis, with a median survival time of 24\u00a0months. The diagnosis of brainstem gliomas typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation and imaging studies, mainly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which provides detailed images and can help identify the characteristics of the tumor. We present a case study of an uncommon presentation of an early stage of HG-BSG in a 33-year-old male, who had a contrast-enhancing lesion in the ventrolateral medulla that extended to the lower aspect of the fourth ventricle and caused ventricular compression. The findings were consistent with the literature on the current state of HG-BSG MRI findings, which typically show contrast-enhancing, hyperintense, and infiltrative lesions that involve the pons, midbrain, or medulla oblongata. The diagnosis of HG-BSG was based on clinical and radiological criteria, as the patient refused to undergo a surgical biopsy. We also performed a literature review on the current state of brainstem HG-BSG MRI findings, summarizing the main features and patterns of these tumors. MRI can offer useful information regarding the tumor's location, size, and features, as well as its impact on surrounding tissues and cerebrospinal fluid circulation.",

        "abstract":"Clinical interventions and death in the intensive care unit (ICU) depend on complex patterns in patients' longitudinal data. We aim to anticipate these events earlier and more consistently so that staff can consider preemptive action. We use a temporal convolutional network to encode longitudinal data and a feedforward neural network to encode demographic data from 4713 ICU admissions in 2014-2018. For each hour of each admission, we predict events in the subsequent 1-6 hours. We compare performance with other models including a recurrent neural network. Our model performed similarly to the recurrent neural network for some events and outperformed it for others. This performance increase was more evident in a sensitivity analysis where the prediction timeframe was varied. Average positive predictive value (95% CI) was 0.786 (0.781-0.790) and 0.738 (0.732-0.743) for up- and down-titrating FiO2, 0.574 (0.519-0.625) for extubation, 0.139 (0.117-0.162) for intubation, 0.533 (0.492-0.572) for starting noradrenaline, 0.441 (0.433-0.448) for fluid challenge, and 0.315 (0.282-0.352) for death. Events were better predicted where their important determinants were captured in structured electronic health data, and where they occurred in homogeneous circumstances. We produce partial dependence plots that show our model learns clinically-plausible associations between its inputs and predictions.

We tested 163 protein sequences representing 116 superfamilies of unrelated proteins. Twenty superfamilies contain proteins with internal gene duplications. The intragenic duplications detected can be divided into two major types. (1) One or more duplications of all or part of a gene produce a protein with two or several detectable regions of sequence homology. Sequences from 18 superfamilies contained this type of duplication. (2) Repeated reduplication of a small DNA segment can produce a protein that is repetitive over most of its length. Three superfamilies contain such repetitive sequences. We also investigated the limits of detection of ancient duplications using sequences derived by random mutation of a model sequence consisting of ten 10-residue repeats. The original repetitive nature of the sequence was usually detected after 250 point mutations even though the ancestral segment could not be accurately reconstructed.",

This is largely due to limited access to overnight sleep testing using polysomnography (PSG). Our goal was to distinguish OSA from healthy individual using a simple maneuver during wakefulness in combination with machine learning methods. Methods: Participants have undergone an overnight PSG to determine their ground truth OSA severity. Separately, they were asked to breathe through a nasal mask or a mouth piece through which negative pressure (NP) was applied, during wakefulness. Airflow waveforms were acquired and several features were extracted and used to train various classifiers to predict OSA. Results and Discussion: The performance of each classifier and experimental setup was calculated. The best results were obtained using Random Forest classifier for distinguishing OSA from healthy individuals with a very good area under the curve of 0.80. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to deploy machine learning and NP with promising path to diagnose OSA during wakefulness.",

Primary and secondary endpoints were changes from baseline in trough FEV\u2081 and peak FEV\u2081 at Week 12, respectively. Health status (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ]), COPD symptoms (Transitional Dyspnea Index [TDI], night and early morning symptoms), and safety were also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 561 patients (mean age, 64 \u00b1 9 years) with a mean baseline FEV\u2081 of 1.36 \u00b1 0.54 L (47.2% of predicted value) were randomized.

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND\nReceipt of blood transfusions is associated with the major consequences of prematurity such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Transfusion-mediated (iron-induced) oxidative damage, coupled with the limited ability of the premature baby to deal with enhanced iron and oxidative load may contribute to this. Adverse effects of transfusion may be related to duration of storage. This study examined the influence of storage on iron and oxidative status in paediatric packed red blood cell units.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPaediatric packed red blood cell units were sampled 3 days post-donation, then at 7 days and weekly until day 35. The extracellular medium was separated and the following measured: total iron concentration, total iron binding capacity, non-transferrin-bound iron, haemoglobin, total and reduced ascorbate, glutathione and malondialdehyde.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMeasurable total and non-transferrin bound iron were present in the extracellular fluid of paediatric packs on day 3. Both parameters rose almost linearly to maximal values at 35 days. Haemoglobin and malondialdehyde levels rose gradually from day 3 to day 21, then more steeply to day 35. Ascorbate existed mainly in the oxidised form and fell rapidly towards the end of storage. Intracellular GSH fell throughout the period of storage. Strong correlations existed between biomarkers of oxidative damage and iron parameters.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThese data suggest that iron released following the initial preparation of packed red blood cell units may derive from free radical-mediated oxidative damage to the red blood cells and haemoglobin, rather than from extracellular haemoglobin. Iron continues to be released during storage as antioxidant protection declines. A cycle of free radical-mediated damage may initiate and then further exacerbate iron release during storage which, in turn, may mediate further free radical-mediated cellular damage. The potential consequences to recipients of older stored blood may be significant.",

For this purpose, the bacteriome and the fecal bacteria contamination of samples from different sewage sludge industrial composting facilities were evaluated. In addition, fecal bacteria indicators and pathogens, such as Salmonella, were isolated from samples collected at key stages of the process and characterized for antibiotic resistance to macrolide, \u03b2-lactam, quinolone, and aminoglycoside families. 16S rRNA phylogeny data revealed that the process clearly evolved toward a prevalence of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria phyla, removing the fecal load. Moreover, antibiotic-resistant microorganisms present in the raw materials were reduced, since these were isolated only in the bio-oxidative phase.

The important roles of neuronal IL15 and IL15Ralpha in experimental autoimmune encephalomeylitis (EAE) are suggested by the upregulation of IL15Ralpha mRNA in different regions of the brain and spinal cord, and by double-labeling immunohistochemistry showing neuronal localization of IL15 and IL15Ralpha in different neurons. Contrary to expectations, IL15 treatment lessened EAE severity. IL15 knockout mice showed heightened susceptibility to EAE with significantly higher scores that were decreased by treatment with IL15. Thus, IL15 improves this CNS autoimmune disorder as a potential therapeutic agent.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of pre-exposure to hyperoxic environment on rat renal IR injury for the first time.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThe effects of 1 h\/d pretreatment with oxygen (>or=95%) for 5 days on a right nephrectomized rat model of renal IR injury was investigated by comparing creatinine clearance, fractional excretion of sodium, plasma creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and histological injury scores among three groups: IR (40 min ischemia-24 h reperfusion), sham (no IR), and hyperoxia (5 days intermittent pretreatment with oxygen + IR).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIntermittent pretreatment with oxygen resulted in significant improvement of creatine clearance and fractional excretion of sodium (P <or= 0.05). Plasma creatinine above 175 micromol\/L or blood urea nitrogen beyond 26 mmol\/L was significantly less frequent in hyperoxia than IR group (P < 0.05). Jablonski histological injury score was also significantly lower in hyperoxia compared to IR group (P < 0.05) and hyperoxic preconditioning significantly reduced the frequency of massive proximal tubular necrosis (12.5% versus 75%, P < 0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe present findings demonstrate that intermittent pre-exposure to hyperoxic environment can reduce subsequent renal IR injury.",

        "abstract":"The heart can be seriously affected in human trichinellosis, and cardiac involvement can cause death. Experimental infections in rats have suggested the possible participation of immunopathological processes. The aim of the present paper was to investigate the possible presence in trichinellosis patient sera of antibodies recognizing host tissues and particularly the myocardium. Nineteen sera from late period trichinellosis patients, who acquired infection in the Poznan region (Poland), were tested by immunoblot on extracts from normal rat or human heart ventricle wall, spleen, placenta, kidney and skeletal muscle. Patients' sera recognized several antigens that were not recognized by normal sera. On rat and human heart ventricle wall, a high proportion of sera (42%) reacted with a protein of 68 kDa (P < 0.05 compared to normal sera). The reactivity with this antigen, however, was not significantly different in patients with or without cardiac involvement. When sera were tested on skeletal muscle we found that 47% reacted with a protein of 27 kDa and 53% reacted with a protein of 41 kDa (P < 0.05 for both proteins, compared with normal sera). The reactivity against the 68 kDa antigen and against the 27 and 41 kDa skeletal muscle antigens was not observed on kidney, placenta and spleen extracts. Moreover, very few bands were observed on these tissues as compared to heart and skeletal muscle tissues, thus suggesting a high tissue specificity of the reactivity of trichinellosis sera. In conclusion, this study identifies organ-specific autoantibodies in trichinellosis patient sera, their role in the pathogenesis of cardiac involvement being still unclear.",

        "abstract":"PURPOSE\nLocoregional progression following definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is common. In this study, we explore the utility of pre-treatment PET for predicting sites of disease progression following CRT.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe identified patients treated at our institution with definitive, concurrent CRT for stage III NSCLC in the years 2007-2010 who underwent staging FDG-PET\/CT. Using a semiautomatic gradient-based tool, visible thoracic hypermetabolic lesions were contoured on each patient's pre-treatment PET. Post-treatment imaging was reviewed to identify specific locations of disease progression. Patients' maximum SUV (SUVmax_pat) and metabolic tumor volume (MTV_pat) were evaluated as predictors of clinical outcomes using logrank testing. Competing risks analysis was performed to examine the relationship between lesion (tumor or lymph node) MTV (MTV_les) and the risk of local disease progression. Patient death and progression in other sites were treated as competing risks.\n\n\nRESULTS\n28 patients with 82 hypermetabolic lesions (27 pulmonary tumors, 55 lymph nodes) met inclusion criteria. Median follow-up was 39.0 months for living patients. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 12.4 months, and median overall survival (OS) was 31.8 months. Low MTV_pat was associated with improved PFS (median 14.3 months for MTV<60 cc vs. 9.7 months for MTV>60 cc, p=0.039). MTV_les was strongly associated with the risk of local disease progression. The 2-year cumulative incidence rate (CIR) for progression in lesions larger than 25 cc was 45%, compared to 5% for lesions under 25 cc (p<0.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPre-treatment PET can be used to identify specific lesions at high risk for treatment failure following definitive CRT for locally advanced NSCLC. Selective treatment intensification to high-risk lesions should be studied as a strategy to improve clinical outcomes in this patient population.",

        "abstract":"Dahl Salt Sensitive (DS) rats rapidly develop high blood pressure when exposed to a high-salt diet. Recent studies suggest that DS rats have poorly functioning baroreceptor afferents and baroreflexes even when salt intake is restricted. This study examines baroreceptor pressure- and mechano-transduction in DS, Dahl Resistant (DR), and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats during low- and high-salt conditions. Single unit, regularly discharging baroreceptors were studied using an in vitro aortic arch-aortic nerve preparation. Pressure thresholds and suprathreshold pressure sensitivities were determined from responses to slow ramps of pressure. Pressure-diameter relations measured in each rat were used to transform pressure threshold and pressure sensitivity values to their mechanical equivalents in terms of aortic wall strain. A total of 407 unit baroreceptors were studied from 49 rats. Tail systolic blood pressures were significantly higher only in DS during high salt. Pressure threshold was similar for all groups on low salt. Exposure to a high-salt diet increased the mean pressure threshold for all three groups. Pressure threshold for high-salt diet was highest in DS and lowest in DR. Pressure sensitivities were lowest in DS and highest in DR on low salt. High salt had no significant effect on pressure sensitivity. The differences in threshold apparent when expressed in terms of pressure were eliminated by conversion to their mechanical equivalents (strain threshold and strain sensitivity). The results suggest that baroreceptors in the two Dahl rat strains represent two extremes from normal baroreceptor function. DS tend to be less pressure responsive than normal (SD), and DR tend to be somewhat more responsive to pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Nucleotide sequences classified as G1 revealed 100% similarity with the Y. enterocolitica D88145.1 sequence (NCBI). Analysis of G2 revealed one point mutation - transition T111A. One mutation was also found in G3, but SNP was placed in a different gene region - transition G193A. Two SNPs - transitions G92C and T111A - were identified in G4. Direct sequencing of 10 variations revealed 5 new variants of the ystB nucleotide sequence: V1 - transition G129A (3 strains); V2 - transitions T111A and G193A (2 strains); V3 - transitions C118T and G193A (1 strain); V4 - transitions C141A and G193A (2 strains); and V5 characterized by 19 SNPs: G83A, T93A, A109G, G114T, C116T, A123G, T134C, T142G, T144C, A150C, G162A, T165G, T170G, T174A, T177G, G178A, A179G, A184G and G193A (2 strains).

The transformation of the paranoid syndrome into the paraphrenic one was attended by a further extension of the syndrome of psychic automatisms. Ideas of grandeur were rather unstable and made up of delusional notions.

        "abstract":"Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) have similar toxic, endocrine-disrupting, and carcinogenic activity. They are classified as persistent organic pollutants accumulating in the environment and the tissues of living organisms. High concentrations of PCDD\/F and dl-PCB have been detected in bovine milk collected in a Piedmont valley (Northwestern Italy) since 2004. This geographic study describes the local distribution of pollution from PCDD\/Fs and dl-PCBs. Since their presence in animal products could be traced back to the ingestion of contaminated fodder, dioxin levels in cow milk were related to the distribution of fodder cropland parcels. Specifically, the aim of the study was to determine, through an exploratory approach, whether the contamination was consistent with one common point source of contamination or different scattered sources. Data for PCDD\/F and dl-PCB concentrations in the bulk milk from 27 herds, sampled over a 4-year period (2004-2007), were matched to the georeferenced land parcels the dairy farmers used for growing fodder. Isopleth maps of dioxin concentrations were estimated with ordinary kriging. The highest level of pollution for both PCDD\/Fs and dl-PCBs was geographically juxtaposed: in both instances, the location of the local steel plant was within this extremely highly polluted area. The study results support the hypothesis for one common point source of contamination in the valley. The exploratory spatial analysis applied in this research may provide a valuable, novel approach to straightforward identification of a highly likely source of dioxin contamination of dairy products (even in the absence of top soil contamination data).",

        "abstract":"A cDNA clone, SO7', from an Eimeria tenella cDNA library was inserted into the high-expression vector pJC264 and was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein, CheY-SO7', with a molecular mass of approximately 36 kDa. By using the purified recombinant antigen to immunize young chicks, it was demonstrated that a single dose, without adjuvant, not only protected against severe coccidiosis induced by infection with E. tenella but also protected chicks challenged with the heterologous species Eimeria acervulina, E. maxima, and E. necatrix. By using rabbit antiserum raised against recombinant CheY-SO7', Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of sporulated oocysts of all seven major species of chicken coccidia showed that all species tested contained proteins characteristic of the B class of antigens, of which CheY-SO7' is representative. It seems likely that a single B antigen could protect chickens against severe coccidiosis caused by infection with any of these Eimeria species. Although chicks exposed to prolonged, natural infection develop antibodies to B antigen, active immunization of young chicks with a protective dose of CheY-SO7' does not elicit a humoral antibody response, suggesting that the partial protection results from cell-mediated effector mechanisms. In addition, the cross-protective nature of the immunity indicates that the response to B antigen is different from that induced by natural infection, which elicits a species-specific immunity. To date, the protection induced by B antigen immunization, although remarkable for a single recombinant protein, is not sufficient to compete with prophylactic chemotherapy.",

        "abstract":"The applications of alginate derived from seaweed polysaccharide in food packaging are restricted due to their inherent deficient antibacterial, antioxidant and UV barrier properties. In this study, nitrogen-functionalized carbon dots (NCDs) with active functions (0.5-3\u202f%) and layered clay (1\u202f%) with barrier property were introduced to construct alginate based active films via solution casting method. The results showed that the synthesized spherical NCDs had a particle size of 2-3\u202fnm, and the internal structure of NCDs was similar to graphene, with a large number of active groups (-NH2, -OH, etc.) on the surface. Infrared analysis revealed that NCDs could form strong hydrogen bonds with alginate matrix, which slowed down the deterioration of mechanical properties and reduced the surface wettability. With the addition of NCDs, active functions and surface hydrophobicity of the active films were enhanced significantly (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). When the amount of NCDs reached 3\u202f%, UV barrier, antioxidant and antibacterial properties of the active films were increased by 50.0\u202f%, 61.1\u202f% and 70.1\u202f%, respectively. The addition of NCDs can enhance the anti-browning ability of alginate based coatings and extend the shelf life of banana significantly. Therefore, a suitable amount of NCDs (1-2\u202f%) and layered clay (1\u202f%) can synergistically improve comprehensive performance of alginate based films and promote their food packaging application used as active films\/inner coatings.",

However, whether this makes a difference to patient outcomes is unknown. We aimed to investigate outcomes and factors associated with patients with acute stroke spending at least 90% of their admission in an SU, compared with those having less time in the SU.\n\n\nDESIGN\nObservational study using cross-sectional data.\n\n\nSETTING\nData from hospitals which participated in the 2015 Stroke Foundation National Audit: Acute Services (Australia) and had an SU. This audit includes an organisational survey and retrospective medical record audit of approximately 40 admissions from each hospital.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nPatients admitted to an SU during their acute admission were included.\n\n\nOUTCOME MEASURES\nHospital-based patient outcomes included length of stay, independence on discharge, severe complications and discharge destination. Patient, organisational and process indicators were included in multilevel logistic modelling to determine factors associated with spending at least 90% of their admission in an SU.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEighty-eight hospitals with an SU audited 2655 cases (median age 76 years, 55% male). Patients who spent at least 90% of their admission in an SU experienced: a length of stay that was 2\u2009days shorter (coefficient -2.77, 95%\u2009CI -3.45 to -2.10), fewer severe complications (adjusted OR (aOR) 0.60, 95%\u2009CI 0.43 to 0.84) and were less often discharged to residential aged care (aOR 0.59, 95%\u2009CI 0.38 to 0.94) than those who had less time in the SU. Patients admitted to an SU within 3\u2009hours of hospital arrival were three times more likely to spend at least 90% of their admission in an SU.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSpending at least 90% of time in an SU is a valid measure of stroke care quality as it results in improved patient outcomes. Direct admission to SUs is warranted.",

Three-arm, mixed methods, randomised controlled trial comparing usual care, versus usual care plus nurse-specialist support, versus usual care plus nurse-specialist support plus peer support. Community-dwelling adults within two years of diagnosis or undergoing diagnosis. PrEliMS involves information provision, emotional support, and strategies and techniques based on psychoeducation, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy principles, supportive listening. One version of the intervention was provided by nurse-specialists alone and the other was provided by nurse-specialists plus peer support. The main outcome of interest was the feasibility of proceeding to a definitive trial, exploring recruitment rate, acceptability, completion of outcome measures (perceived stress, mood, self-efficacy, psychological impact, and service use), and signal of efficacy. Of 40 participants randomised (mean age 36.2 years (SD\u2009=\u200914.8); 54% women; 85% with relapsing-remitting MS), 36 and 38 returned 3- and 6-month questionnaires, respectively. Participant interviews suggested the trial was largely feasible, and the intervention acceptable, with some amendments to trial procedures and intervention delivery noted. There were, however, no statistically significant differences between groups at followup for any measures, and effect-size estimates were small. A definitive trial combining nurse-specialist and peer support adjustment to diagnosis intervention is warranted, but more work exploring the delivery and fidelity of the intervention is needed before this is pursued.",

To determine whether tissue oxygenation in the hypertrophied ventricles was supported by a proportional growth of the capillary network, morphometric analysis was used to measure capillary luminal volume and surface densities and the diffusion distance for O2. The volume fraction of capillary lumen and the luminal surface of capillaries, related to O2 availability and diffusion, were altered by -21 and -19%, respectively, in the left ventricle and by -23 and -20%, respectively, in the right ventricle. The path length for O2 transport was found to be increased by 12 and 15% in the left and right ventricle, respectively. In contrast, myocyte mass expanded in proportion to tissue growth in the left ventricle and exceeded tissue growth by 5% in the right ventricle. Myocyte mitochondria and myofibrils both grew in proportion to the cells, so that their volume ratio was not changed in either ventricle. The relatively inadequate adaptation of the capillary vasculature suggests that hypertrophy after severe myocardial infarction may initially leave the heart more vulnerable to additional ischemic episodes.",

On average, isolates from 3ADON populations produced significantly (P<0.05) more trichothecene and had significantly (P<0.005) higher fecundity and growth rates than isolates from the 15ADON population. These results indicate that selection is driving the rapid spread of an introduced pathogen population that is more toxigenic and potentially more vigorous.

This was done to aid physicians in better understanding this condition for clinical management. The search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science libraries on March 30, 2023. Two reviewers independently screened the studies using Endnote software. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the quality of the studies. A total of nine studies were included in the review. Among patients with OI, positive and statistically significant correlations of NLR were seen with more severe disease, a prolonged hospital stay, postoperative requirement of antibiotics, and total antibiotic dose needed. In the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, the optimum cut-off level of NLR was 5.19 (specificity: 81, sensitivity: 51). In addition, NLR was correlated with preoperative fever (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Among patients with Ludwig's Angina, NLR could predict disease severity and length of stay in the hospital (p\u2009=\u20090.032 and p\u2009=\u20090.033, respectively). In addition, the relationship between the NLR and mortality was statistically significant (p\u2009=\u20090.026, specificity of 55.5%, and sensitivity of 70.8%). Among patients with severe oral and maxillofacial space infection, a positive correlation was found between IL-6 and CRP with NLR (rs\u2009=\u20090.773, P\u2009=\u20090.005 and rs\u2009=\u20090.556, P\u2009=\u20090.020, respectively). Also, a higher NLR was considered an essential predictor of organ involvement (P\u2009=\u20090.027) and the number of complications (P\u2009=\u20090.001). However, among diabetes mellitus (DM) patients afflicted with submandibular abscesses, NLR had no association with therapeutic response. Many people around the world suffer from OI, and a cheap and fast biomarker is needed for it. Interestingly, inflammation plays a role in this infection, and elevated NLR levels can be a good biomarker of inflammation and, as a result, for OI progression.",

The aims of this study were (i) to evaluate the tolerance and survival of sorafenib-treated patients, in a nonselected population, especially in Child-Pugh B patients; and (ii) to identify potential prognostic factors of survival.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nFrom April 2007 to December 2008, 50 patients received sorafenib for advanced HCC. Seventeen (34%) were Child-Pugh B patients. We recorded adverse events and the duration of treatment and survival. For 34 patients with histopathologically proven HCC, immunophenotypical analysis was carried out using antibodies against cluster differentiation 34, vascular endothelial growth factor, phosphorylated ERK, cytokeratin 19, and phosphorylated stat3.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis had a more advanced stage of the disease compared with Child-Pugh A patients. The occurrence of adverse events was similar in Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B patients. Duration of treatment until discontinuation for bad tolerance was lower in Child-Pugh B patients (1.8 vs. 5 months, P=0.02). Survival of Child-Pugh A patients was higher compared with Child-Pugh B patients (8.9 vs. 2 months, P=0.004). Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status, portal vein impairment, extra-hepatic spread, and alpha-foetoprotein were also prognostic factors. In multivariate analysis, the sole factor associated with survival was the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage. None of the immunohistological markers used was associated with tolerance and survival.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOccurrence of adverse events is similar in Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B patients. Nevertheless, the survival of Child-Pugh B patients is very low. Whether liver function or tumor spread is responsible for mortality is unclear. Opportunity of treatment for Child-Pugh B patients is questionable. The immunophenotype of tumoral tissue was not predictive of survival.",

The selection of the preoperative assessments, primary outcome measures, and participant inclusion is described. Frailty and mobility measurements will be collected at the preoperative visit and include the 6 Robinson frailty measurements and the Timed Up and Go mobility test. The main outcome measure in the FASt supplemental study will be moderate to severe postoperative adverse events according to the Clavien-Dindo Severity Classification.

The prognosis of patients was related to clinical stages, treatment and cryptorchidism.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSince there is no significant difference in the oncological control effects in Stage I testicular seminoma, radiotherapy is not necessary after radical orchiectomy to avoid the side effects of radiation. The treatment of testicular non-seminoma, testicular seminoma in the stage II and III should combine the radical orchiectomy and radiotherapy. Early diagnosis and early treatment are the two most important factors affecting the survival of patients with testicular germ cell tumor.",

        "abstract":"Sepsis frequently causes systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ failure in patients. Neoastilbin (NAS) is a flavonoid that plays vital functions in inflammation. This work aims to investigate the protective effects of NAS against sepsis-induced liver and kidney injury and elucidate its underlying mechanisms. The mouse model was established using cecal ligation puncture (CLP) induction. NAS was given to mice by gavage for 7 consecutive days before surgery. Liver and kidney function, oxidative stress, and inflammatory factors in serum or tissues were examined by ELISA or related kits. The expression of relevant proteins was assessed by Western blot. Hematoxylin and eosin and\/or periodic acid-Schiff staining revealed that NAS ameliorated the pathological damage in liver and kidney tissues of CLP-induced mice. NAS improved liver and kidney functions, as evidenced by elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, Creatinine, ALT, and AST in the serum of septic mice. TUNEL assay and the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax showed that NAS dramatically reduced apoptosis in liver and renal tissues. NAS treatment lowered the levels of myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde, while elevated the superoxide dismutase content in liver and kidney tissues of CLP-induced mice. The levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2) in the serum and both tissues of CLP-injured mice were markedly decreased by NAS. Mechanically, NAS downregulated TLR4 expression and inhibited NF-\u03baB activation, and overexpression of TLR4 reversed the protective effects of NAS against liver and kidney injury. Collectively, NAS attenuated CLP-induced apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, and dysfunction in the liver and kidney by restraining the TLR4\/NF-\u03baB pathway.",

The plants were exposed for a period of 24h in previously chosen sites around Brazil, within the proximity of nuclear waste deposits. In each location, three points were chosen for bio-monitoring. The results obtained at these locations showed a small increment in the frequency of micronuclei per cell of the biosensor. From these data, a scale of mutagenesis effects due to low-dose radiation was built up.

A group of rats was trained to perform a working memory task, delayed alternation, in an operant chamber for food reinforcement. The rats had to choose one of two response levers in an alternative manner in each trial, with a certain interval between trials. They had to remember which lever they chose in the previous trial without the assistance of external cues. Another group was trained to perform a reference memory task, cued alternation, in which the behavioral sequence was identical, but an external cue was provided. After stable behavior was established, a dialysis probe was implanted into the prefrontal cortex or the hippocampus of each rat. The extracellular concentration of ACh in the dialysates from the prefrontal cortex increased during performance of the delayed alternation task, while the hippocampal ACh showed a more distinct increase during performance of the cued alternation task. These results suggest that the prefrontal ACh is mainly related to working memory, whereas the hippocampal ACh is mainly related to reference memory.",

The norepinephrine response to anesthesia and surgery did not differ significantly between the three groups. The postoperative cortisol response to ACTH stimulation was normal in the control group (maximum rise in plasma cortisol was 20.1 +\/- 2.9 micrograms\/dl [mean +\/- SEM] ), however, it was decreased in all patients receiving etomidate, whether by a short infusion (mean change in plasma cortisol was -3.8 +\/- 1.9 micrograms\/dl) or as a single induction dose (mean change in plasma cortisol was -4.0 +\/- 2.0 micrograms\/dl). Similarly, the postoperative aldosterone levels in the control group increased normally in response to ACTH (+ 10.2 +\/- 3.0 ng\/dl) but decreased in both the etomidate I and etomidate II groups (-3.0 +\/- 0.7 ng\/dl and -3.3 +\/- 1.0 ng\/dl, respectively). Because ACTH was administered exogenously, etomidate-induced suppression of adrenocortical response appeared to be a direct effect on the adrenal gland, which was present at a time when the serum etomidate levels were in the subhypnotic range.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The h6h gene encoding H6H from Hyoscyamus niger was introduced, under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter, into non-hyoscyamine-producing Nicotiana tabacum and hyoscyamine-producing Hyoscyamus muticus. The transformation was performed using a binary vector system based on Agrobacterium rhizogenes. Production of scopolamine in hairy roots was clearly correlated with the 35S-h6h transcript expression. The engineered N. tabacum and H. muticus hairy roots were studied for the production of scopolamine and other tropane and nicotine alkaloids after feeding the cultures with exogenous hyoscyamine. N. tabacum hairy roots carrying the 35S-h6h transgene showed a more efficient uptake of hyoscyamine from the culture medium and a higher rate of bioconversion of hyoscyamine to scopolamine than those of H. muticus. In particular, the secretion of scopolamine in N. tabacum hairy roots was remarkably high, up to 85% of the total scopolamine being released to the culture medium. Exogenous hyoscyamine also caused changes in nicotine alkaloid accumulation in N. tabacum hairy roots.",

        "abstract":"The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway decreases the abundance of mRNAs that contain premature termination codons and prevents suppression of nonsense alleles. The UPF1 gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was shown to be a trans-acting factor in this decay pathway. The Upf1p demonstrates RNA-dependent ATPase, RNA helicase, and RNA binding activities. The results presented here investigate the binding affinity of the Upf1p for ATP and the consequences of ATP binding on its affinity for RNA. The results demonstrate that the Upf1p binds ATP in the absence of RNA. Consistent with this result, the TR800AA mutant form of the Upf1p still bound ATP, although it does not bind RNA. ATP binding also modulates the affinity of Upf1p for RNA. The RNA binding activity of the DE572AA mutant form of the Upf1p, which lacks ATPase activity, still bound ATP as efficiently as the wild-type Upf1p and destabilized the Upf1p-RNA complex. Similarly, ATPgammaS, a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP, interacted with Upf1p and promoted disassociation of the Upf1p-RNA complex. The conserved lysine residue (K436) in the helicase motif Ia in the Upf1p was shown to be critical for ATP binding. Taken together, these findings formally prove that ATP can bind Upf1p in the absence of RNA and that this interaction has consequences on the formation of the Upf1p-RNA complex. Further, the results support the genetic evidence indicating that ATP binding is important for the Upf1p to increase the translation termination efficiency at a nonsense codon. Based on these findings, a model describing how the Upf1p functions in modulating translation and turnover and the potential insights into the mechanism of the Upf1p helicase will be discussed.",

The pooled steroid-failure rate among 291 children from five studies is 34% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 27%-41%). It is suggested that corticosteroids should be dosed between 1-1.5 mg\/kg up to 40-60 mg daily. Food restriction has a limited role in severe UC and should be generally discouraged in children who do not have a surgical abdomen. Appraisal of radiologic findings in children must recognize the variation in colonic width with age and size. Data suggest that the Pediatric UC Activity Index (PUCAI), determined at day 3, should be used to screen for patients likely to fail corticosteroids (>45 points), and at day 5 to dictate the introduction of second-line therapy (>65-70 points). Cyclosporine is successful in children with severe colitis but its use should be restricted to 3-4 months while bridging to thiopurine treatment (pooled short-term success rate 81% [95% CI: 76%-86%]; n = 94 from eight studies).

In toxic megacolon, in patients refractory to one salvage medical therapy, and in chronic severe disease, colectomy may be preferred.

This paper discusses the application of convolutional neural networks to detect the merged microdroplet in the flow field and classify them in an on-the-go manner based on the extent of mixing. The droplets are generated in PMMA microfluidic devices employing flow-focusing and cross-flow configurations. The visualization of binary coalescence of droplets is performed by a CCD camera attached to a microscope, and the sequence of images is recorded. Different real-time object localization and classification networks such as You Only Look Once and Singleshot Multibox Detector are deployed for droplet detection and characterization. A custom dataset to train these deep neural networks to detect and classify is created from the captured images and labeled manually. The merged droplets are segregated based on the degree of mixing into three categories: low mixing, intermediate mixing, and high mixing. The trained model is tested against images taken at different ambient conditions, droplet shapes, droplet sizes, and binary-fluid combinations, which indeed exhibited high accuracy and precision in predictions. In addition, it is demonstrated that these schemes are efficient in localization of coalesced binary droplets from the recorded video or image and classify them based on grade of mixing irrespective of experimental conditions in real time.",

As a major final product, unlike in the case of the alkaline decomposition of tetrathionate and pentathionate, a significant amount of sulfur deposition was also observed. Nevertheless, the chromatograms clearly suggested that heptathionate also appears as a key intermediate in a detectable amount during the course of the reaction. On the basis of these observations an 11-step kinetic model with 9 fitted and 4 fixed rate coefficients is suggested to take all of the most important characteristics of the decomposition into account. The proposed model includes the well-known thiosulfate-assisted sulfur chain, increasing pathways for tetrathionate and pentathionate along with their rate coefficients, but among them that of the thiosulfate-assisted rearrangement of pentathionate has not been reported yet. Having these kinetic parameters in hand reveals a reasonable trend of these rate coefficients against the length of the sulfur chain, suggesting that the attack of the nucleophilic agents like hydroxide, thiosulfate, and sulfite ions is determined by the electron density in the vicinity of the given sulfur atom.",

        "title":"Transcriptional activation of Salmonella typhimurium invasion genes by a member of the phosphorylated response-regulator superfamily.",
        "abstract":"The Salmonella typhimurium PhoP-repressed locus prgHIJK encodes components of a sec-independent type III secretion apparatus. This apparatus is composed of at least 17 proteins encoded on a 40 kb pathogenicity Island located at centisome 63 on the S. typhimurium chromosome. The secretion apparatus and some of its targets, SapB, SapC and SspD, are necessary for epithelial cell invasion. The transcription of many invasion genes, including prgHIJK, is coordinately activated by HilA, a transcription factor encoded within the pathogenicity island. In this report we identify sirA, a gene located outside the pathogenicity island that is essential for induction of prgHIJK and hilA transcription. sirA encodes a 234-amino-acid protein that is essential for S. typhimurium Ssp (Salmonella secreted protein) secretion and invasion and is similar to response regulators of two-component regulatory systems. sirA-mutant phenotypes could be suppressed by two DNA clones from unlinked loci, designated sirB and sirC. These data suggest that SirA may be phosphorylated in response to S. typhimurium sensing a mammalian microenvironment. Furthermore, SirA phosphorylation is predicted to initiate a cascade of transcription-factor synthesis which results in invasion-gene transcription, Ssp secretion, and bacterial invasion of epithelia.",

Esophageal leiomyomatosis is a rare hamartomatous disorder with varied presentation. It is described mostly in children and is associated with Alport's syndrome. A retrospective analysis of three cases managed in the Department of General Surgery at Chandigarh over a period of 10 years. The study involves three female patients of different generations within the same family with age range of 10-58 years. All presented with dysphagia of 2-7 years duration. Barium swallow revealed a long-segment stricture in two patients. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a circumferential mass lesion in the lower esophagus in all the patients. Esophageal resection was carried out in all the patients. All patients made an uneventful recovery. Esophageal leiomyomatosis should be suspected in patients with long-standing dysphagia. Barium findings are suggestive but can mimic achalasia. CT scan shows a circumferential esophageal wall thickening. Surgical resection and reconstruction of the digestive passage is the optimal treatment.",

        "abstract":"Human Carboxylesterase 1 (hCES1) is the key liver microsomal enzyme responsible for detoxification and metabolism of a variety of clinical drugs. To analyse the role of the single N-linked glycan on the structure and activity of the enzyme, authentically glycosylated and aglycosylated hCES1, generated by mutating asparagine 79 to glutamine, were produced in human embryonic kidney cells. Purified enzymes were shown to be predominantly trimeric in solution by analytical ultracentrifugation. The purified aglycosylated enzyme was found to be more active than glycosylated hCES1 and analysis of enzyme kinetics revealed that both enzymes exhibit positive cooperativity. Crystal structures of hCES1 a catalytically inactive mutant (S221A) and the aglycosylated enzyme were determined in the absence of any ligand or substrate to high resolutions (1.86 \u00c5, 1.48 \u00c5 and 2.01 \u00c5, respectively). Superposition of all three structures showed only minor conformational differences with a root mean square deviations of around 0.5 \u00c5 over all C\u03b1 positions. Comparison of the active sites of these un-liganded enzymes with the structures of hCES1-ligand complexes showed that side-chains of the catalytic triad were pre-disposed for substrate binding. Overall the results indicate that preventing N-glycosylation of hCES1 does not significantly affect the structure or activity of the enzyme.",

The objectives of this study were to investigate its relationship with other microstructural and functional alterations of the subcortical nuclei and the diagnostic utility of these MRI-related metrics.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 22 WD patients and 20 healthy controls (HCs) underwent 3.0T multimodal MRI scanning. Susceptibility, volume, diffusion microstructural indices and whole-brain functional connectivity of the putamen (PU), globus pallidus (GP), caudate nucleus (CN), and thalamus (TH) were analyzed. Receiver operating curve (ROC) was applied to evaluate the diagnostic value of the imaging data. Correlation analysis was performed to explore the connection between susceptibility change and microstructure and functional impairment of WD and screen for neuroimaging biomarkers of disease severity.\n\n\nResults\nWilson's disease patients demonstrated increased susceptibility in the PU, GP, and TH, and widespread atrophy and microstructural impairments in the PU, GP, CN, and TH. Functional connectivity decreased within the basal ganglia and increased between the PU and cortex. The ROC model showed higher diagnostic value of isotropic volume fraction (ISOVF, in the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging model) compared with susceptibility. Severity of neurological symptoms was correlated with volume and ISOVF. Susceptibility was positively correlated with ISOVF in GP.\n\n\nConclusion\nMicrostructural impairment of the basal ganglia is related to excessive metal accumulation in WD. Brain atrophy and microstructural impairments are useful neuroimaging biomarkers for the neurological impairment of WD.",

        "abstract":"Eighty-four eyes with aging macular degeneration were included in this five-year retrospective study (1989-1994). Sixty-four eyes were treated with laser, whereas in 20 eyes photocoagulation was not performed because these patients refused laser treatment. The latter served as a control group. Out of 64 laser-treated eyes, 48 (75%) eyes had extramacular choroidal, and 15 (25%) juxtafoveal neovascular membrane. A comparable percentage and alterations were recorded in the control group of eyes. At the beginning of the study, the mean visual acuity distribution was 0.5 in both the treated and untreated group of eyes, which was not statistically significant (p > 0.16). Recurrent neovascularization developed in 33 (52%) out of 64 eyes at the end of the first and in the second year after photocoagulation, being the main cause of severe vision impairment. At the beginning of the second year, the risk of severe vision loss by six or more Snellen's lines was recorded in 14 (41%) out of 33 eyes with the vision of 0.15, and after five years in 22 (73%) out of 33 eyes with the vision of 0.08. A the end of the study, unchanged or slightly deteriorated visual acuity (0.5-0.4) was found in 27 (42.1%) out of 64 laser-treated eyes, and in only 2 (10%) out of 20 untreated eyes.

Serotype-specific rabbit polyclonal antisera or mock antisera were passively administered to rabbits before either intravenous infection with 10\u00b9\u00b9 CFU S. pneumoniae or corneal infection with 10\u2075 CFU of S. pneumoniae.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter active immunization, clinical scores of corneas of the rabbits immunized with \u03c8PLY and Freund's adjuvant were significantly lower than scores of the rabbits that were mock immunized with PBS and Freund's adjuvant or with PPSV23 and Freund's adjuvant at 48 hours after infection (P \u2264 0.0010), whereas rabbits immunized with PPSV23 and Freund's adjuvant failed to show differences in clinical scores compared with those in mock-immunized rabbits (P = 1.00) at 24 and 48 hours after infection. Antisera from rabbits actively immunized with PPSV23 and Freund's adjuvant were nonopsonizing. Bacterial loads recovered from infected corneas were higher for the \u03c8PLY- and PPSV23-immunized rabbits after infection with WU2, when compared with the mock-immunized rabbits (P \u2264 0.007). Conversely, after infection with K1443, the \u03c8PLY-immunized rabbits had lower bacterial loads than the control rabbits (P = 0.0008). Quantitation of IgG, IgA, and IgM in the sera of \u03c8PLY-immunized rabbits showed high concentrations of PLY-specific IgG. Furthermore, anti-PLY IgG purified from \u03c8PLY-immunized rabbits neutralized the cytolytic effects of PLY on human corneal epithelial cells. Passive administration of serotype-specific antisera capable of opsonizing and killing S. pneumoniae protected against pneumococcal bacteremia (P \u2264 0.05), but not against keratitis (P \u2265 0.476).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nActive immunization with pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide and Freund's adjuvant fails to produce opsonizing antibodies, and passive administration of serotype specific opsonizing antibodies offers no protection against pneumococcal keratitis in the rabbit, whereas active immunization with the conserved protein virulence factor PLY and Freund's adjuvant is able to reduce corneal inflammation associated with pneumococcal keratitis, but has variable effects on bacterial loads in the cornea.",

Vascular loops of various appearances were found in the types of papillae studied, i.e. the large and the small filiform papillae and the fungiform ones. Such hairpin loops may function as countercurrent exchangers and to test this hypothesis tissue osmolality was determined in the papillae, while exposing them to various isotonic electrolyte solutions. The large filiform papillae with a vascular arrangement similar to that of intestinal villi exhibited a marked osmolar gradient from tip to base when exposed to a solution containing both glucose and sodium. If sodium and\/or glucose was excluded from the solution, tissue osmolality was significantly decreased. This was also the case when the chloride ions of the solution was substituted with sulphate. The small filiform papillae are only provided with one or a few capillary loops. They exhibited a less marked osmolar gradient than the large ones and one of the different electrolyte solutions decreased the gradient. In the fungiform papillae a tissue hyperosmolality at the tip was also demonstrated. It is proposed that the papillary epithelium is provided with active transport mechanism(s) and that the papillary vessels function as countercurrent multipliers. The functional importance of these mechanisms are tentatively discussed.",

Lack of a convenient, high-throughput method for the determination of these compounds has prevented population-based studies of their possible associations with lifestyle, nutrition, and chronic diseases.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSerum or plasma samples were deproteinized by mixing with three volumes of acetonitrile that contained d(9)-choline and d(9)-betaine as internal standards. We used a normal-phase silica column for the separation of choline (retention time, 2.8 min), betaine (1.3 min), DMG (1.15 min), and internal standards, which were detected as positive ions by tandem mass spectroscopy in the multiple-reaction monitoring mode, using the molecular transitions m\/z 104-->60 (choline), m\/z 113-->69 (d(9)-choline), m\/z 118-->59 (betaine), m\/z 127-->68 (d(9)-betaine), and m\/z 104-->58 (DMG).\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor all three metabolites, the assay was linear in the range 0.4-400 micromol\/L, and the lower limit of the detection (signal-to-noise ratio = 5) was < or =0.3 micromol\/L. The within- and between-day imprecision (CVs) was 2.1-7.2% and 3.5-8.8%, respectively. The analytical recovery was 87-105%. The fasting plasma concentrations (median, 25th-75th percentiles) were 8.0 (7.0-9.3) micromol\/L for choline, 31.7 (27.0-41.1) micromol\/L for betaine, and 1.66 (1.30-2.02) micromol\/L for DMG in 60 healthy blood donors. In individuals who had eaten a light breakfast, plasma concentrations of all three metabolites were significantly (25-30%) higher than in fasting individuals.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis is the first method for the combined measurement of choline, betaine, and DMG in human plasma or serum. The assay is characterized by simple sample preparation, no derivatization, high throughput, imprecision (CV) <10%, detection limits below the values seen in volunteers, and the high specificity provided by tandem mass spectroscopy.",

To explore whether nocturnal versus diurnal activity is responsible for constraints on molecular evolution and plays a role in visual opsin spectral tuning of colubrids, we carried out molecular evolution analyses of the visual opsin genes LWS, RH1, and SWS1 from 17 species and performed morphological analyses.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPhylogenetic reconstructions of the RH1 and LWS recovered major clades characterized by primarily diurnal or primarily nocturnal activity patterns, in contrast with the topology for SWS1, which is very similar to the species tree. We found stronger signals of purifying selection along diurnal and nocturnal lineages for RH1 and SWS1, respectively. A blue-shift of the RH1 spectral peak is associated with diurnal habits. Spectral tuning of cone opsins did not differ among diurnal and nocturnal species. Retinas of nocturnal colubrids had many rows of photoreceptor nuclei, with large numbers of rods, labeled by wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and two types of cones: large cones sensitive to long\/medium wavelengths (L\/M) and small cones sensitive to ultra-violet\/violet wavelengths (UV\/VS). In contrast, retinas of diurnal species had only one row of photoreceptor nuclei, with four types of cones: large and double L\/M cones, small UV\/VS cones, and a second group of small cones, labeled by WGA.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFor LWS gene, selection tests did not confirm different constraints related to activity pattern. For SWS1, stronger purifying selection in nocturnal lineages indicates divergent evolutionary pressures related to the activity pattern, and the importance of the short wavelength sensitivity at low light condition. Activity pattern has a clear influence on the signatures of selection and spectral tuning of RH1, with stronger purifying selection in diurnal lineages, which indicates selective pressure to preserve rhodopsin structure and function in pure-cone retinas. We suggest that the presence of four cone types in primarily diurnal colubrids might be related to the gain of color discrimination capacity.",

Standardised mean differences (SMDs) were used to compare change scores between groups and descriptors of exercise prescription assessed according to the Template for Intervention Description and Replication and the Toigo and Boutellier recommendations.\n\n\nRESULTS\n3 studies (n=93) were eligible for inclusion in the review. Varying strengthening exercises were compared with stretching and foot orthoses (n=2) or no intervention (n=1). Moderate effects (SMD 0.6-1.2) were found for reducing pain and disability with eccentric strengthening in conjunction with stretching and orthoses compared with concentric exercises, stretching and orthoses combined, and stretching and orthoses alone. Evaluation of exercise prescription parameters demonstrated minimal reporting, with the only consistent parameters being the number of sets and repetitions of the exercises, and the duration of the experimental period.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis review demonstrates the paucity of high-quality research for the conservative management of posterior tibial tendon dysfunction, and highlights the lack of exercise prescription parameters reported in clinical trials.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER\nCRD42017076156.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND\nIntestinal atresia represents a significant surgically correctable cause of intestinal obstruction in neonates. Intestinal development proceeds as a tube-like structure with differentiation along its axis. As the intestine differentiates, the cecum develops at the transition from small to large intestine. Fgf10 is known to serve a key role in budding morphogenesis; however, little is known about its role in the development of this transitional structure. Here we evaluate the effect of Fgf10\/Fgfr2b invalidation on the developing cecum.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWild-type C57Bl\/6, Fgf10(-\/-), and Fgfr2b(-\/-) embryos harvested from timed pregnant mothers were analyzed for cecal phenotype, Fgf10 expression, and differentiation of smooth muscle actin.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWt cecal development is first evident at E11.5. FGF10 is discreetly expressed in the area of the developing cecum at early stages of development. One hundred percent of Fgf10(-\/-) and Fgfr2b(-\/-) mutant embryos demonstrate cecal atresia with absence of epithelial and muscular layers. The development of neighboring anatomical structures such as the ileocecal valve is not affected by Fgf10\/Fgfr2b invalidation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFGF10 expression is localized to the cecum early in the normal development of the cecum. Fgf10(-\/-) and Fgfr2b(-\/-) mutant embryos demonstrate cecal atresia with complete penetrance. Epithelial and muscular layers of the cecum are not present in the atretic cecum. The Fgf10(-\/-) and Fgfr2b(-\/-) mutants represent a genetically reproducible animal model of autosomal recessive intestinal atresia.",

        "abstract":"Recently, an increased incidence of central diabetes insipidus (CDI) in pregnancy, and less frequently in the post partum period, has been reported, most probably favoured by some conditions occurring in pregnancy. This study was aimed at investigating the influence of pregnancy on a pre-existing potential\/subclinical hypothalamic autoimmunity. We studied the longitudinal behaviour of arginine-vasopressin cell antibodies (AVPcAbs) and post-pituitary function in two young women with a positive history of autoimmune disease and presence of AVPcAbs, but without clinical CDI, and who became pregnant 5 and 7 months after our first observation. The behaviour of post-pituitary function and AVPcAbs (by immunofluorescence) was evaluated at baseline, during pregnancy and for 2 years after delivery. AVPcAbs, present at low\/middle titres at baseline in both patients, showed a titre increase during pregnancy in one patient and after delivery in the other patient, with development of clinically overt CDI. Therapy with 1-deamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) caused a prompt clinical remission. After a first unsuccessful attempt of withdrawal, the therapy was definitively stopped at the 6th and the 7th month of post partum period respectively, when AVPcAbs disappeared, accompanied by post-pituitary function recovery, persisting until the end of the follow-up. The determination of AVPcAbs is advisable in patients with autoimmune diseases planning their pregnancy, because they could be considered good predictive markers of gestational or post partum autoimmune CDI. The monitoring of AVPcAb titres and post-pituitary function during pregnancy in these patients may allow for an early diagnosis and an early replacement therapy, which could induce the disappearance of these antibodies with consequent complete remission of CDI.",

In the present study, clonidine led to significant antinociceptive effects in both groups of rats. Clonidine was found to be highly effective in arthritic animals, even at the lower concentration: the elevation in threshold produced by 30 micrograms\/kg i.v. was 160% in arthritic vs. 124% in normal rats. The effects of clonidine were prevented dose-dependently by pretreatment with yohimbine or idazoxan 250 to 1000 micrograms\/kg i.v., in the two groups of rats, indicating clearly that the dose-dependent effects of i.v. clonidine are mediated by alpha-2 adrenoceptors.",

        "abstract":"The bedside head impulse test (bHIT) is a clinical method of assessing the vestibulo-ocular reflex. It is a critical component of the bedside assessment of dizzy patients and helps differentiate acute stroke from vestibular neuritis. A previous study on senior Otolaryngology residents showed poor competence in performing and interpreting the bHIT and called for specific evaluations in the Competency By Design (CBD) curriculum to remedy this. This study aimed to assess whether those competencies have improved after full implementation of CBD in residency programs. Thirty post-graduate year 4 Otolaryngology residents in Canada were evaluated on the use of the bHIT using a written multiple-choice question (MCQ) examination, interpretation of bHIT videos, and performance of a bHIT. Ratings of bHIT performance were completed by 2 expert examiners (DT, DL) using the Ottawa Clinic Assessment Tool. Only 6.7% (rater DT) and 20% (rater DL) of residents were found able to perform the bHIT independently. Inter-rater reliability was moderate (0.55, intraclass correlation). Mean scores were 70% (13.4% standard deviation) for video interpretation and 59% (20.6% standard deviation) for multiple-choice questions. Video interpretation scores did not correlate with bHIT ratings (Pearson r\u2009=\u20090.11), but MCQs and bHIT ratings did correlate moderately (Pearson r\u2009=\u20090.52).Comparing to the prior study, residents performed worse on the bHIT (3.14 average score vs 3.64, P\u2009<\u2009.01) and fewer residents performed the bHIT independently (6.7% vs 22%-rater DT, 20% vs 39%-rater DL). Residents also performed worse on MCQs (58.7% vs 70.9%, P\u2009=\u20090.038), though similarly on video interpretation (70% vs 65%, P\u2009=\u2009.198). Fourth year OTL-HNS residents in Canada are not competent in performing the bHIT. These findings have implications for refining competency-based curricula in the evaluation of critical physical exam skills.",

The geographically restricted diploids B. intermedius and B. squarrosus displayed less genetic diversity (the mean population gene diversity of Nei (Hu) ranged from 0.03 to 0.12) than the widespread tetraploid colonizers B. lanceolatus and B. hordeaceus (Hu = 0.07-0.27). Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg expectations in diploid populations of B. intermedius and B. squarrosus were observed owing to heterozygote excess at several loci and suggested that these self-fertilizing species may have substantial amounts of allogamy. Tetraploid populations of B. lanceolatus and B. hordeaceus were largely homozygous at homologous loci and frequently exhibited intergenomic fixed heterozygosity in accordance with their alloploid origin. Genetic variation at the infraspecific level was mostly distributed within populations in the four species, B. hordeaceus showing the lowest level of interpopulation differentiation (Gst = 0.06) and the highest level of gene flow (Nm = 3.75). Consistent gene flows are in agreement with the strongest intercontinental invasive behaviour of B. hordeaceus. Less differentiation was reported in the literature among later introduced B. hordeaceus populations from England and Australia, indicating reduced differentiation under the process of colonization. Moderate divergence occured among the four taxa, with interspecific genetic identities ranging from 0.87 to 0.93. In spite of substantial genetic similarity, species were clearly differentiated, with each tetraploid being more closely related to a diploid: B. hordeaceus to B. squarrosus and B. lanceolatus to B. intermedius.",

        "abstract":"Indoor navigation systems (indoor positioning systems) can improve orientation for patients in hospitals and help employees to track assets. Many hospitals would like to implement indoor positioning systems but do not know how. To support them in doing this, and to gain knowledge about the requirements for indoor positioning system implementation, our research identifies the design criteria relevant to indoor positioning system implementation projects. A design science research process is built to design and evaluate an artifact. For this, five indoor positioning system developers and five hospital IT management representatives from various hospitals and companies in Germany are interviewed. Further, controlled experiments are conducted in Germany, using an ultrasound-based indoor positioning system. We determined and tested indoor positioning system functions, evaluated indoor positioning system performance criteria, and identified the operating conditions in hospitals. Our results show that indoor positioning system functions should provide a benefit to a hospital's daily operations, that some performance criteria are more important than others, and that operating conditions are important, e.g., radiation. As a theoretical contribution, we show how design science research can be applied to the context of indoor positioning systems in hospitals. In addition, we make a practical contribution in that our propositions can be used for future indoor positioning system developments.",

        "abstract":"OBJECTIVE\nMarfan syndrome (MFS) involves a deficiency of the structural extracellular matrix component fibrillin-1 and overactivation of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signalling pathway. The TGF-\u03b2 signalling pathway also actively participates in malignant transformation. Although anecdotal case reports have suggested associations between MFS\/MFS-like conditions and several haematological and solid malignancies, such associations have not been thoroughly evaluated in large-scale studies. We sought to use a nationwide healthcare insurance claim database to evaluate whether patients with MFS are at increased risk of malignancy.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nWe conducted a nested case-control analysis using a database extracted from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. All medical conditions for each case and control were categorised using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision classifications. ORs and 95% CIs for associations between MFS and malignancies were estimated using conditional logistic regression and adjusted for comorbidities.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur analyses included 1 153 137 cancer cases and 1 153 137 propensity score-matched controls. Relative to other subjects, patients with MFS had a significantly higher risk of having a malignancy (adjusted OR 3.991) and hypertension (adjusted OR 1.964) and were significantly more likely to be men. Malignancies originating from the head and neck and the urinary tract were significantly more frequent among patients with MFS than among subjects without MFS.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPatients with MFS are at increased risk of developing various malignancies. Healthcare professionals should be aware of this risk when treating such patients, and increased cancer surveillance may be necessary for these patients.",

        "abstract":"Cancer\/testis antigens (CTAs) are a large family of tumor-associated antigens expressed in human tumors of different histological origin, but not in normal tissues, with the exception of the testes and placenta. Numerous immunohistochemical studies have reported associations between CTA expression and a negative estrogen receptor (ER) status in breast tumors, and demonstrated that CTAs are frequently expressed in tumors with higher nuclear grade. The expression of CTAs has not been studied as extensively in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as it has been in invasive breast cancer. The present retrospective study included archived paraffin-embedded specimens from 83 patients diagnosed with DCIS in the period between January 2007 and December 2014. The follow-up time for local recurrence ranged between 1 and 8 years (mean, 5.02 years). Antigens from the melanoma-associated antigen gene (MAGE) family, namely multi-MAGE-A, MAGE-A1, MAGE-A10 and New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 1 (NY-ESO-1) antigen, were evaluated by immunostaining and their subcellular location was investigated. Presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was evaluated on all sections, together with the histopathological variables of DCIS. Specific tested antigens exhibited associations with histopathological parameters for DCIS and all demonstrated statistically significant associations with nuclear staining, simultaneous cytoplasmic and nuclear staining, and local recurrence. Antigen MAGE-A10 demonstrated a significant association with higher expression of ER (P=0.005) and higher tumor nuclear grade (P=0.001), cytoplasmic staining (P=0.029) and antigen NY-ESO-1 with higher tumor size (P=0.001), expression of TILs (P=0.001) and R1 resection (P=0.001). A \u03c72 test revealed significant associations between simultaneous cytoplasmic and nuclear staining and local recurrence (P=0.005), central necrosis (P=0.016), and the expression of ER (P=0.003) and progesterone receptor (PR) (P=0.010). Additional analysis revealed an association between antigen MAGE-A10 and TILs (P=0.05). Additional analysis of TILs indicated that they were significantly associated with tumor grade (P=0.023), central necrosis (P<0.001), ER (P=0.003) and PR (P=0.029). Overall, CTAs from the MAGE family (MAGE-A1, multi-MAGE-A and MAGE-A10) and NY-ESO-1 associate with histopathological predictive variables of DCIS. The expression of antigens NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-A10 could serve an important role in the treatment of patients with negative histopathological predictive variables, but further analysis is required. Simultaneous cytoplasmic and nuclear protein expression of MAGE-A family and NY-ESO-1 CTAs may represent an independent marker for local recurrence. Taken together, the present data suggest that CTAs are not perfect indicators of invasiveness for DCIS, but could inform treatment strategies for patients when taken in combination with other histopathological predictive variables. However, this was a small study and further larger studies will be necessary to confirm the current findings.",

This study aims to broadly review the use of ablative lasers (Er:YAG and CO2) in the treatment of melasma, presenting the level of evidence of studies published to date. A total of 75 patients were enrolled in four case series studies (n=39), one controlled clinical trial (n=6) and one randomized controlled clinical trial (n=30). Studies on the Er:YAG laser showed better results with the use of short square-shaped pulses, which determined low rates of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and long-lasting maintenance of results. Likewise, studies on the CO2 laser proved the benefits of short pulse duration along with low-density energy. Post-treatment maintenance with the use of antipigmenting creams was necessary and effective to sustain long-term results. Ablative lasers may represent another useful and effective tool against melasma. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and difficulty in sustaining long-term results still represent the main limitations to a broader use of ablative lasers. Based on actual evidence, the use of this technology should be restricted to patients with recalcitrant disease. Further studies will help establish optimal laser parameters and treatment regimens.",

        "abstract":"Under normal circumstances, the adaptive immune response to either self or harmless antigens is kept under tight control by a combination of deletion mechanisms in the central immune system, and by a system of regulatory cells in the periphery. Together, these control mechanisms enforce a state referred to as immunological tolerance. Breakdown of these mechanisms lead to a variety of immunological disease states involving persistent immune-mediated pathologies. Whereas the processes inducing central tolerance in the immune system are well documented, the mechanisms by which peripheral regulatory cells function are still unclear. Recent publications have reported an unexpected role for the Notch pathway, itself a classical regulator of cell fate, in the development of regulatory T cells. These exciting data demonstrate that Notch signals modulate events downstream of the T cell receptor, diverting T cell differentiation into alternative fates which regulate immune responses in an antigen-specific manner. The Notch pathway is, therefore, uniquely positioned in the developmental pathways leading to regulatory T cells. In this review, the authors discuss the data surrounding the role of Notch in the peripheral immune system, and discuss how this pathway might be manipulated for the treatment of immunological disorders.",

The occurrence of some allergic reactions can be predicted by skin testing, especially severe adverse reactions such as anaphylactic shock. Thus, penicillin and cephalosporin skin tests are widely used to predict allergic reactions before medication in pediatrics. However, false-positive results from skin tests were more often encountered in pediatrics than in adults. In fact, many children labeled as allergic to \u03b2-lactam are not allergic to the antibiotic, leading to the use of alternative antibiotics, which are less effective and more toxic, and the increase of antibiotic resistance. There has been controversy over whether \u03b2-lactam antibiotics should be tested for skin allergies before application in children. Based on the great controversy in the implementation of \u03b2-lactam antibiotic skin tests, especially the controversial cephalosporin skin tests in pediatrics, the mechanism and reasons of anaphylaxis to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, the significance of \u03b2-lactam antibiotic skin tests, the current state of \u03b2-lactam antibiotic skin tests at home and abroad, and the problems of domestic and international skin tests were analyzed to determine a unified standard of \u03b2-lactam antibiotic skin tests in pediatrics to prevent and decrease adverse drug reactions, avoid waste of drugs, and a large amount of manpower and material resource consumption.",

In addition, few studies have compared the stability of C2 laminar screw and pars screw constructs.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo compare the biomechanical stability of 3 different C1-2 construct conditions (C2 pars screw, C2 intralaminar screw, C2 intralaminar construct with C2 laminar decortication).\n\n\nMETHODS\nFourteen fresh-frozen cadaveric cervical specimens (C1-3) were used. In 7 specimens, pure moments of 1.5 Nm were applied in flexion\/extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. Each specimen was tested in the normal state, in the destabilized state (after odontoidectomy and resection of transverse atlantal ligament), and after application of constructs. After kinematic study, these 7 specimens underwent axial pullout strength testing of pars screw and 50% decorticated C2 intralaminar screws. In another 7 specimens, insertion torque and pullout strength were measured to compare the pars screw and intact C2 intralaminar screw.\n\n\nRESULTS\n: There were no statistically significant differences between the intact C2 intralaminar and 50% decorticated C2 intralaminar screw constructs in terms of range-of-motion limitations. The C2 pars screw construct was significantly superior to the C2 laminar screw construct in lateral bending (P < .01) and axial rotation (P < .01) and equivalent to the C2 laminar screw construct in flexion\/extension (P = .42). There was no significant pullout strength difference between the 3 kinds of C2 screw.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe C1 lateral mass-C2 pars screws construct was stronger than the C1 lateral mass-C2 intralaminar screw construct. Decortication of C2 laminar (up to 50%) did not affect the immediate stability of the C1-2 construct.",

        "abstract":"Stimulation of \u03b11-adrenoceptors evokes inflammatory cytokine production, boosts neurogenic inflammation and pain, and influences cellular migration and proliferation. As expression of \u03b11-adrenoceptors increases on dermal nerves and keratinocytes after peripheral nerve injury, the aim of this study was to determine whether another form of tissue injury (a cutaneous burn) triggered a similar response. In particular, changes in expression of \u03b11-adrenoceptors were investigated on dermal nerve fibres, keratinocytes and fibroblast-like cells using immunohistochemistry 2-12 weeks after a full thickness burn in Wistar rats. Within two weeks of the burn, local increases in \u03b11-adrenoceptor expression were seen in the re-forming epidermis, in dense bands of spindle-shaped cells in the upper dermis (putatively infiltrating immune cells and fibroblasts), and on nerve fibres in the deep dermis. In addition, nerve fibre density increased approximately three-fold in the deep dermis, and this response persisted for several more weeks. In contrast, \u03b11-adrenoceptor labelled cells and staining intensity in the upper dermis decreased contralateral to the burn, as did nerve fibre density in the deep dermis. These findings suggest that inflammatory mediators and\/or growth factors at the site of a burn trigger the synthesis of \u03b11-adrenoceptors on resident epidermal cells and nerve fibres, and an influx of \u03b11-adrenoceptor labelled cells. The heightened expression of \u03b11-adrenoceptors in injured tissue could shape inflammatory and wound healing responses.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND\nAntibodies targeting blood stage antigens are important in protection against malaria, but the key targets and mechanisms of immunity are not well understood. Merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) is an abundant and essential protein. The C-terminal 19 kDa region (MSP1-19) is regarded as a promising vaccine candidate and may also be an important target of immunity.\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY\/FINDINGS\nGrowth inhibitory antibodies against asexual-stage parasites and IgG to recombinant MSP1-19 were measured in plasma samples from a longitudinal cohort of 206 children in Papua New Guinea. Differential inhibition by samples of mutant P. falciparum lines that expressed either the P. falciparum or P. chabaudi form of MSP1-19 were used to quantify MSP1-19 specific growth-inhibitory antibodies. The great majority of children had detectable IgG to MSP1-19, and high levels of IgG were significantly associated with a reduced risk of symptomatic P. falciparum malaria during the 6-month follow-up period. However, there was little evidence of PfMSP1-19 specific growth inhibition by plasma samples from children. Similar results were found when testing non-dialysed or dialysed plasma, or purified antibodies, or when measuring growth inhibition in flow cytometry or microscopy-based assays. Rabbit antisera generated by immunization with recombinant MSP1-19 demonstrated strong MSP1-19 specific growth-inhibitory activity, which appeared to be due to much higher antibody levels than human samples; antibody avidity was similar between rabbit antisera and human plasma.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\/SIGNIFICANCE\nThese data suggest that MSP1-19 is not a major target of growth inhibitory antibodies and that the protective effects of antibodies to MSP1-19 are not due to growth inhibitory activity, but may instead be mediated by other mechanisms. Alternatively, antibodies to MSP1-19 may act as a marker of protective immunity.",

        "abstract":"Botryosphaeria dothidea, a notorious plant pathogen, is responsible for causing chestnut rot during postharvest storage. This research aimed to assess the antifungal properties of perilla essential oil (PEO) and perillaldehyde (PAE) against B. dothidea. PEO's and PAE's inhibitory effects on B. dothidea were investigated using an agar dilution method, a fumigation method, and an in vivo assay in chestnuts and shell buckets. Based on the results of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, it was confirmed that the main component of PEO was elemicin. The antifungal mechanism of PEO and PAE against B. dothidea was investigated by conducting staining experiments of the fungal cell wall and cell membrane. PEO and PAE strongly inhibit the mycelial growth of B. dothidea in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory mechanism is mainly related to the destruction of the integrity of the fungal cell wall and plasma membrane. Notably, PEO retains its antifungal efficacy against B. dothidea in chestnuts, effectively prolonging their storage life. These findings indicate that PEO and PAE are nontoxic, eco-friendly botanical fungicides, holding promise for controlling postharvest chestnut rot.",

        "abstract":"The murine leukemia virus LP-BM5 has been used to reproduce the model of murine AIDS in order to evaluate the course of infection with the MO-1 strain of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). LP-BM5 was inoculated in C57BL\/6 mice by intravenous (i.v.) injection either 8 weeks before an i.v. challenge with 10(3) or 10(6) CFU of MAC (coinfection 1) or 10 days after an i.v. challenge with 10(3) CFU of MAC (coinfection 2). During coinfection 2 experiments, the phenotypic alterations in blood lymphocyte subsets were analyzed. During coinfection 1, LP-BM5 infection tended to decrease the mycobacterial growth, with the difference reaching statistical significance for the lower inoculum (10(3) CFU of MAC) (P<0.001). During coinfection 2, LP-BM5 did not exacerbate MAC infection except in the spleen, at day 90 after LP-BM5 challenge (P<0.001). LP-BM5 infection and the LP-BM5-MAC coinfection increased the numbers of activated CD4+ lymphocytes (CD4+ Ly6AE+) (P<0.001), activated CD8+ lymphocytes (CD8+ Ly6AE+) (P<0.001), and activated B lymphocytes (Ly5+ Ly6AE+) (P<0.001). This activation of T lymphocytes could explain the lack of exacerbation of MAC infection and even the trend to a lower level of MAC infection. Thus, this model of retroviral infection of mice does not seem to be a reliable model of immunodepression for the study of MAC infection and its treatments.",

However, the PFV cell composition and pathogenetic mechanisms are poorly understood. This study aims to characterize PFV cell composition and associated molecular features and attempts to lay a foundation for further understanding the disease.\n\n\nMethods\nImmunohistochemistry was conducted to characterize cell types at the tissue level. Single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) was performed on the vitreous cells derived from normal and Fz5 mutant mice at two early postnatal ages and human PFV samples. Bioinformatic tools were used to cluster cells and analyze their molecular features and functions.\n\n\nResults\nThe findings of this study are as follows: (1) a total of 10 defined and one undefined cell types were characterized in both the hyaloid vessel system and PFV by sc-RNAseq and immunohistochemistry; (2) neural crest-derived melanocytes, astrocytes, and fibroblasts were specifically retained in the mutant PFV; (3) Fz5 mutants were found to possess more vitreous cells at early postnatal age 3 but returned to similar levels as the wild type at postnatal age 6; (4) altered phagocytic and proliferation environments and cell-cell interactions were detected in the mutant vitreous; (5) the human PFV samples shared fibroblast, endothelial and macrophage cell types with the mouse, but having distinct immune cells including T cells, NK cells and Neutrophils; and last, (6) some neural crest features were also shared between certain mouse and human vitreous cell types.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe characterized PFV cell composition and associated molecular features in the Fz5 mutant mice and two human PFV samples. The excessively migrated vitreous cells, intrinsic molecular properties of these cells, phagocytic environment, and cell-cell interactions may together contribute to PFV pathogenesis.

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND\nOphthalmodynamometric studies can provide useful clinical information regarding glaucoma, cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and vascular disease but are affected by variable reproducibility and unknown calibration of force in terms of intraocular pressure (IOP). The aim of this study was to calculate calibration factors and identify key design principles using three different types of ophthalmodynamometers.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe constructed a modified ophthalmodynamometer named OcuDyn using a large contact lens inside a ring force transducer with continuous signal acquisition and averaging. OcuDyn and Sisler ophthalmodynamometers were applied to isolated pig eyes which were cannulated and connected to a fluid reservoir and a pressure transducer to measure induced IOP at increasing force application. Using these two devices and a Meditron ophthalmodynamometer, we measured the minimum ophthalmodynamometric force (ODF) required to induce pulsation in the hemi-veins and diastolic retinal artery of each eye in glaucoma patient volunteers and family members.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBlood pressure was measured with the sphygmomanometer cuff held at eye level. In pigs, the relationship between induced IOP and ODF was strong (minimum r > 0.98, p < 0.001). In humans, the pressure increment (blood pressure - baseline IOP) correlated highly with human arterial ODF (r = 0.83, n = 75, p < 0.001, mean slope 0.32). Mean coefficients of variation were 12.4% (n = 66) for veins and 5.6% (n = 39) for arteries in diastole; these results did not differ significantly with those from the Meditron but were significantly lower than results with the Sisler (20%, p = 0.0014).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLinearity between induced IOP and ODF is strong, suggesting that calibration of 0.32 mmHg\/g for OcuDyn or using two point blood pressure measures allows for valid interpolation. The better optics of the Meditron and OcuDyn result in more repeatable end-point determination and outweigh benefits conferred by signal averaging or slit lamp mounting. We calculate calibration factors of 0.89 mmHg\/arbitrary unit for Meditron and 0.82 mmHg\/g for Sisler. These factors may be useful in the estimation of ocular vascular, orbital, and cerebrospinal fluid pressures.",

From a total of 108,956 individual cattle records, 1,036 cases of AV and 7,695 cases of LDA were identified, with a ratio of LDA to AV cases of 7.4 to 1. In-hospital mortality was 23.5% for AV and 5.6% for LDA. Age, breed, gender, and season each had significant (P less than 0.05) effects on risk for AV and LDA. Risk for AV and LDA increased with increasing age, with greater risk in cattle aged 4 to 7 years. Dairy cattle were at higher risk of developing AV (adjusted odds ratio, 36.4) and LDA (adjusted odds ratio, 95.2) than were beef cattle. The odds of AV in Brown Swiss cattle were significantly (P less than 0.0001) lower, and the odds of LDA in Guernsey cattle were significantly (P less than 0.0001) higher than those in Holstein cattle. Female cattle were also at higher risk of developing AV (adjusted odds ratio, 3.3) and LDA (adjusted odds ratio, 29.1) than were male cattle. The odds of AV and LDA varied considerably throughout the year, with the lowest number of cases observed in autumn. Seasonal development of AV differed significantly (P less than 0.0001) from that of LDA, with the odds of AV and LDA being highest in January and March, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

A family assessment provides information about the social substrate for the evolution of the presenting complaint as well as information to better understand the patient's problems. There are many ways to assess families, and there are a variety of family assessment instruments to help with the assessments. Clinician will be best served by becoming familiar and comfortable with at least one assessment model that is consistent, structured, and evaluates a wide range of family functions. Such an assessment can be incorporated into routine clinical care. A good family assessment can be therapeutic in and of itself even if the decision is made that no further family intervention is indicated.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate risk factors for complications after pancreatic head resection and to assess whether the complication rate changed during the study period.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData of 301 patients undergoing pancreatic head resection were recorded prospectively. Risk factors were assessed by multivariate analysis. The first and second part of the study period were compared.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMortality was 3%. Overall and surgery-related complications occurred in 42% and 28%, respectively. Independent risk factors for postoperative morbidity were impaired renal function (odds ratio [OR] 2.7), absence of preoperative biliary drainage (OR 1.9), and resection of other organs (OR 3.2). Complication rate, duration of surgery, amount of blood transfused, and length of hospital stay decreased during the study period.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIncreasing hospital experience decreased complication rates. Patients with risk factors should be considered for transferal to specialized centers.",

        "abstract":"Inhibin bioactivity and mRNA for inhibin subunits were measured in four dog Sertoli cell tumours and in the testes of five normal control dogs. The tumours contained increased levels of inhibin (P less than 0.05) and mRNA for the alpha and beta B subunits when compared with controls, whereas the mRNA for the beta A subunit was not detected in tumours or control testes. The inhibin bioactivity was associated with a 32 kDa molecule in both Sertoli cell tumours and normal dog testes; no higher molecular weight forms were found after sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Peripheral levels of immunoassayable inhibin in dogs with Sertoli cell tumours were higher than those in the controls (P = 0.01), indicating that it might be possible to use this parameter as a marker for Sertoli cell tumours. Other testicular tumours, however, might also secrete immunoactive inhibin. The increased inhibin concentrations are likely to be the cause of the suppressed peripheral levels of FSH (P less than 0.02). However, peripheral levels of LH (P less than 0.02) and testosterone (P less than 0.01) were also suppressed in the dogs with Sertoli cell tumours, whereas the concentrations of oestradiol in the peripheral plasma of both groups did not differ. Finally, i.v. injection of the LHRH agonist buserelin caused a significant increase in LH and testosterone in the control dogs, but not in the dogs with Sertoli cell tumours. It was concluded that secretory products from the Sertoli cell tumours suppressed pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. It is unlikely that testosterone or oestradiol play a role in this respect. FSH may be suppressed by the high levels of inhibin in tumour-bearing dogs, but it remains unclear whether inhibin or another Sertoli cell product is responsible for the unresponsiveness of the pituitary gland to LHRH and the suppression of LH.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES\nCulex tritaeniorhynchus is the primary vector of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) which is a major threat to animals and humans health. This virus has been reported earlier from low altitude regions of Tibet, in mosquitoes, Tibetan pigs and local Tibetans, but no reports are available for the probable propagation of JE to high altitude regions (3100 m) of Tibet. This study aimed to find the evidence of JEV in Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and pigs from high altitude regions of Tibet, China.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn total, 102 porcine serum samples and eight pools of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus were subjected to real-time PCR (RT-PCR) for the amplification of a fragment (~ 420 bp) of the NS1 gene. The resultant amplicons of the genes were subsequently analyzed and sequenced.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall seroprevalence of JE in Tibetan pigs was 6.86%, while five pools of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus were found positive for JEV. Results showed genotype III as the most prevalent (100%) among JEV positive isolates. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the JEV positive strains showed 98.8-99% similarity to four reference strains from China (JEV-Hubei, Whe, HYZ and CQ11-66).\n\n\nINTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION\nThe present study revealed that JEV has extended its geographic range to high altitude regions of Tibet. The factors like increased tourism and transportation might play key role in the transmission of JE that comprises a potential health risk for humans and animals.",

In such a network, TFs (transcription factors) and TGs (target genes) are represented as nodes and regulatory interactions between TFs and TGs are represented as directed links. In the present review, I address the following topics pertaining to transcriptional regulatory networks. (i) Structure and organization: first, I introduce the concept of networks and discuss our understanding of the structure and organization of transcriptional networks. (ii) Evolution: I then describe the different mechanisms and forces that influence network evolution and shape network structure. (iii) Dynamics: I discuss studies that have integrated information on dynamics such as mRNA abundance or half-life, with data on transcriptional network in order to elucidate general principles of regulatory network dynamics. In particular, I discuss how cell-to-cell variability in the expression level of TFs could permit differential utilization of the same underlying network by distinct members of a genetically identical cell population. Finally, I conclude by discussing open questions for future research and highlighting the implications for evolution, development, disease and applications such as genetic engineering.",

        "abstract":"To elucidate and compare the genetic, clinical, ancillary diagnostic, and pathological characteristics across different Gerstmann-Str\u00e4ussler-Scheinker disease (GSS) phenotypes and explore the underlying causes of the phenotypic heterogeneities. The genetic, clinical, ancillary diagnostic, and pathological profiles of GSS patients reported in the literature were obtained and analyzed. Additionally, 3 patients with genetically confirmed GSS from our unit were included. Based on clinical presentation, patients were classified into typical GSS, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)-like GSS, GSS with dementia, and other categories. A total of 329 GSS cases were included with a 1.13:1 female-to-male ratio, median onset age 44, and median duration 4\u00a0years. Of the 294 categorized patients, 50.7% had typical GSS, 24.8% showed CJD-like GSS, and 16.3% presented with GSS with dementia. Clinical classification varied significantly based on genotype, with P102L more common in typical GSS and A117V prevalent in CJD-like GSS. Polymorphism at codon 129 has no effect on GSS phenotype, but the 129\u00a0M allele acts as a protective factor in GSS patients in Asia and North America. Moderate to severe spongiform degeneration and the presence of PK-resistant small fragments migrating at <11\u00a0kDa on electrophoretic gels along with PrP27-30 fragments were more prevalent in CJD-like GSS phenotype, while hyperphosphorylated tau protein co-deposition tends to be characteristic of typical GSS and GSS with dementia. This study reveals GSS's intricate nature, showing significant variations in clinical presentations, diagnostic findings, and pathological features. Mutation sites and pathological changes play crucial roles in determining the GSS clinical heterogeneity.",

        "abstract":"Self-doping is an essential method of increasing carrier concentrations in organic electronics that eliminates the need to tailor host-dopant miscibility, a necessary step when employing molecular dopants. Self-n-doping can be accomplished using amines or ammonium counterions as an electron source, which are being incorporated into an ever-increasingly diverse range of organic materials spanning many applications. Self-n-doped materials have demonstrated exemplary and, in many cases, benchmark performances in a variety of applications. However, an in-depth review of the method is lacking. Perylene diimide (PDI) chromophores are an important mainstay in the semiconductor literature with well-known structure-function characteristics and are also one of the most widely utilized scaffolds for self-n-doping. In this review, we describe the unique properties of self-n-doped PDIs, delineate structure-function relationships, and discuss self-n-doped PDI performance in a range of applications. In particular, the impact of amine\/ammonium incorporation into the PDI scaffold on doping efficiency is reviewed with regard to attachment mode, tether distance, counterion selection, and steric encumbrance. Self-n-doped PDIs are a unique set of PDI structural derivatives whose properties are amenable to a broad range of applications such as biochemistry, solar energy conversion, thermoelectric modules, batteries, and photocatalysis. Finally, we discuss challenges and the future outlook of self-n-doping principles.",

A series of 5'-end deletions and nucleotide substitutions in the upstream regions of RPO21 and RPO22 were tested for their effect on the expression of lacZ fusions of these genes. Deletion of sequences from -723 to -693 in RPO21, which disrupted two Reb1p-binding sites and an Abf1p-binding site, resulted in a 10-fold decrease in expression. A T-rich region downstream of these sites was also important for expression. Deletion of sequences from -437 to -392 in the RPO22-upstream, which resulted in a 30-fold decrease in expression, indicated that the Reb1p- and Abf1p-binding sites in this region were important for RPO22 expression, as was a T-rich sequence immediately downstream of these sites. The RPO21 and RPO22 upstream regions were capable of interacting in vitro (gel-mobility-shift assays) with Reb1p and Abf1p. The similarities in the type and organization of elements in the upstream regions of RPO21 and RPO22 suggest that expression of these genes may be regulated coordinately.",

A critical care research utilization committee was formed with representation from each of the adult critical care units, the emergency department, and the postanesthesia care unit. This committee was responsible for reviewing and revising each critical care policy and procedure on the basis of the best available evidence. The impetus for this project was a concern that current policies and procedures were, in part, based on tradition rather than on science and did not always reflect rapid changes in critical care, including use of new equipment, new treatments, and new findings. This project produced a number of beneficial outcomes. Policies and procedures were revised on the basis of scientific evidence, new research questions were generated on the basis of gaps in the literature, and the number of clinical nurses involved in using research to improve practice increased.",

In addition, the effect of some hormones on GAG-synthesis was studied. As compared to normolipidemic controls, type IIA hyperlipoproteinemic sera decreased markedly the synthesis of HA without affecting the synthesis of S-GAGs. On the contrary, sera with high HDL-cholesterol concentration decreased the synthesis of S-GAGs causing a decrease in S-GAGs\/HA ratio. Cortisol in concentrations slightly above the physiological level inhibited the synthesis of HA and increased the S-GAGs\/HA ratio. Insulin, and interestingly also sex hormones (estradiol, progesterone, testosterone) had no clear effect on GAG-synthesis. It is known that there is an increased S-GAGs\/HA ratio in early atherosclerotic lesions.

Rings of aorta, suspended in 10-ml organ chambers containing a physiologic salt solution, were precontracted with phenylephrine. Neutrophils (1 X 10(5) -4 X 10(7) cells\/organ chamber) caused a cell number-dependent relaxation of the rat aorta that was augmented by superoxide dismutase (100 U\/ml) or changing the oxygen content from 95 to 21%. The neutrophil-induced smooth muscle relaxation occurred in rings with and without endothelium and in rings precontracted with increasing concentrations of phenylephrine, prostaglandin F2 alpha or KCI. Catalase (1000 U\/ml) and mannitol (1 X 10(-3) M) did not block the neutrophil-induced relaxation, whereas phenazine methosulfate (1 X 10(-5) M), hydroquinone (3 X 10(-5) M) and methylene blue (1 X 10(-5) M) reversed the neutrophil-induced relaxation. Pre-exposure of endothelium-rubbed rings to neutrophils (2 X 10(7) cells\/organ chamber; 15 min) depressed the subsequent concentration-response curve to phenylephrine but augmented the relaxation induced by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor zaprinast (1 X 10(-5) M). The effluent from a column restraining the neutrophils induced a relaxation of endothelium-rubbed aortic rings that was prevented by methylene blue (1 X 10(-5) M). These results demonstrate that rat neutrophils release a factor that has a pharmacologic profile similar to that previously reported for the relaxing factor released from the vascular endothelium.",

        "abstract":"OBJECT\nThe authors investigated the efficacy of intrathecal baclofen therapy, analyzing the complications and risk factors in 200 consecutive patients who received pump implants.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe patient population included 200 patients (mean age 13.7 +\/- 5.68 years). The follow-up duration varied from 13.07 to 87.50 months (mean 50.71 months).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean Ashworth Scale, Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale, clonus, and spasm scores decreased postoperatively. Overall, 31% of patients experienced complications as follows: 11% had cerebrospinal fluid leakage, 7% had catheter-related problems, 7.5% suffered infections; 5.5% of patients had more than one complication.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe authors found that the onset of at least one complication is statistically more likely in patients with Ashworth Scale scores higher than 3 and an age of 10 years or younger. A reduction in the incidence of infection from 10 to 4.8% by the end of the study period appears to be correlated with the switch in technique to subfascial instead of subcutaneous pump implantation and the adoption of a new preoperative prophylaxis protocol in the last 51 patients. There were no statistically significant correlations between the onset of complications and patient weight, ambulatory status, or the presence of dystonia or cerebral palsy.",

        "abstract":"Highly sensitive differential scanning microcalorimetry (DSC) has been used to investigate the phase transition properties of lipid vesicles prepared from 1,2-distearoyl-L-3-glyceryl-phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) in H(2)O and D(2)O. The data show that the response of pre-transition properties to D(2)O-->H(2)O substitution is stronger than the main transition properties. We find that there is a small increase in the phase transition temperature (DeltaT approximately 0.5 K) and in the co-operative unit in the main transition. The increase in enthalpy (DeltaH congruent with1 kJ(.)mol(-1)) and in transition temperature (DeltaT congruent with2 K) observed in the pre-transition is comparable with that observed in quite different processes and systems, i.e. melting of nucleic acids and proteins and gel formation. It is suggested that D(2)O-->H(2)O substitution affects the thermal transition in these systems in such a way that the contributions of enthalpy and entropy to structural reorganization of water in these processes is modified.",

        "abstract":"A scanning electron microscopic (SEM) cast method that has been utilized to examine the internal structure of dentine was modified to examine canalicular communications in the cortices of a human femur and ulna. Although some preparations in which all of the matrix was removed were examined, etched preparations were found to be the most informative. Casts of lacunae and canaliculi along with the underlying matrix could be visualized in these preparations. In the femur, whose cortex exhibited a typical lamellar pattern, canalicular communication was seen between first and second generation osteons and occasionally between osteons and interstitial regions. The interstitial regions in the ulna appeared to be primarily woven rather than lamellar bone. Extensive communication between the outermost lacunae of osteons and interstitial regions was observed in the ulna.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND\nProlonged labor is one of the most important risk factors for perinatal compromise and, if caused by obstructed labor, it carries the risk of uterine rupture, postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), puerperal sepsis, and maternal death.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether or not hyoscine butylbromide shortens the stages of labor, without an increase in maternal or neonatal complications.\n\n\nMETHOD\nIn single-blinded randomized clinical trial study, 188 multiparas women in active phase of labor who were admitted to Shahid Sadoughi Hospital from October 2006 to April 2007 in Yazd - Iran, were evaluated. They were divided hyoscine group (n = 94) received 20mg (1ml) of hyoscine and control group (n = 94) received 1 ml of normal saline was given as placebo, intravenously. The effects of hyoscine in shortening labor time; and neonatal Apgar score was compared.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuration of the first (mean\u00b1 SD: 186.8 \u00b1 125.6 minutes vs. 260.4 \u00b1 120.9 minutes, p= 0.00 1) and second stage of labor (mean\u00b1 SD: 20.0 \u00b1 8.1minutes vs. 25.8 \u00b1 9.4 minutes, p= 0.03) was shorter in hyoscine group. Frequency of cesarean section and mean of neonatal Apgar score at minutes of one and 5 were not different in both groups. No serious adverse events were seen in the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nInjection of hyoscine in active phase of labor can be effective in shortening of labor without any adverse effect on mother and fetus.",

Genotypes exhibited a wide range of variations. Three genotypes DS40, DS30, and DS26 could be used as an antioxidant profile enriched stem amaranth. Phenolics, phytopigments, flavonoids, and vitamins of stem amaranth leaves exhibited strong antioxidant activity.
