Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on stem loop 2 of U1 small nuclear RNA and a construct of the U1A protein were carried out to obtain predictions of the structures for the unbound forms in solution and to elucidate dynamical aspects of induced fit upon binding.
A crystal structure of the complex between the U1A protein and stem loop 2 RNA and an NMR structure for the uncomplexed form of the U1A protein are available from Oubridge et al.
(Nature, 1994, Vol. 372, pp. 432-438) and Avis et al.
(Journal of Molecular Biology, 1996, Vol. 257, pp.
As a consequence, U1A-RNA binding is a particularly attractive case for investigations of induced fit in protein-nucleic acid complexation.
When combined with the available structural data, the results from simulations indicate that structural adaptation of U1A protein and RNA define distinct mechanisms for induced fit.
For the protein, the calculations indicate that induced fit upon binding involves a non-native thermodynamic substate in which the structure is preorganized for binding.
In contrast, induced fit of the RNA involves a distortion of the native structure in solution to an unstable form.
However, the RNA solution structures predicted from simulation show evidence that structures in which groups of bases are favorably oriented for binding the U1A protein are thermally accessible.
These results, which quantify with computational modeling recent proposals on induced fit and conformational capture by Leuillot and Varani (Biochemistry, 2001, Vol. 40, pp. 7947-7956) and by Williamson (Nature Structural Biology, 2000, Vol. 7, pp. 834-837) suggest an important role for intrinsic molecular architecture and substates other than the native form in the specificity of protein-RNA interactions.
