The optimal age to cryopreserve oocytes for later use is before 36 years.
Current users are on average 38 years old.
In this cross-sectional study an online survey was constructed about the factors associated with the intentions of childless women aged 28-35 years to use fertility preservation (FP).
Questions were derived from the Theory of Planned Behaviour (attitudes and subjective norms regarding FP and perceived behaviour control to do FP) and the Health Belief Model (perceived susceptibility of infertility, perceived severity of childlessness, barriers and benefits of FP and cue to use FP).
Also addressed were parenthood goals, fertility knowledge and intentions to use FP within 2 years.
The data were analysed using structural equation modelling.
The Health Belief Model showed a good fit to the data (Ï‡(2)
[14, n = 257] = 13.63, P = 0.477; CFI = 1.000: RMSEA = 00, 90%
Higher intentions to use FP were associated with feeling susceptible to infertility, considering FP useful to achieve parenthood, perceiving the implications of infertility as severe, expecting to have children at a later age and having fewer ethical concerns.
This suggests an increase of fertility awareness is necessary for the optimal use of FP.
