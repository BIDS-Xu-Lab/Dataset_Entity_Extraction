Angiogenesis is a dynamic, multi-step process.
It is known that about 70 diseases are related to angiogenesis.
Both the experimental and the literature reports showed that Sophora flavescens inhibit angiogenesis significantly, but the material basis and the mechanism of action have not been clear.
In this study, molecular docking was used for screening of anti-angiogenesis flavonoids from the roots of S. flavescens.
One handred and twenty-six flavonoids selected from S. flavescens were screened in the docking ligand database with six targets(VEGF-a,TEK,KDR,Flt1,FGFR1 and FGFR2) as the receptors.
In addition, the small-molecule approved drugs of targets from DrugBank database were set as a reference with minimum score of each target's approved drugs as threshold.
The LibDock module in Discovery Studio 2.5 (DS2.5) software was applied to screen the compounds.
As a result, 37 compounds were screened out that their scores were higher than the minimum score of approved drugs as well as being in the top of 10%.
At last the mechanism of flavonoids anti-angiogenesis was preliminarily revealed, which provided a new method for the development of angiogenesis inhibitor drugs.
