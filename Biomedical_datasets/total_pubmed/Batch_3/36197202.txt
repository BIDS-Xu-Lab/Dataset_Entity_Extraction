The objective for the study was to analysis the epidemiology of adenosarcoma, and independent prognostic factors and impact of lymph node dissection (LND) of uterine adenosarcoma.
Cases of patients with primary adenosarcoma were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 2000 to 2016.
Overall survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test.
The differences in baseline covariates between the 2 groups were adjusted by inverse probability of treatment weighting method.
The prognostic factors were identified by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis and hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) of covariates were also estimated.
1129 patients with pathological primary adenosarcoma between 2000 and 2016 were identified from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database.
The only 4 patients were male.
1027 patients with primary uterine adenosarcoma, and 53.1% underwent LND and only 3.5% patients were with positive lymph node.
Age, marital status, largest tumor size, tumor grade, T stage and chemotherapy were significantly correlated with survival.
Race, tumor number, LND, and radiotherapy did not affect overall survival in patients.
Inverse probability of treatment weighting-adjusted K-M curve showed that LND did not improve survival and lymph node metastasis (LNM) did not affect survival.
The majority of primary adenosarcoma patients are female with high incidence of uterus and rare incidence of distant metastasis.
Age, marital status, tumor size, T stage, grade, and chemotherapy are independent prognostic factors of uterine adenosarcoma.
LNM was not a significant prognostic risk factor, and LND did not benefit survival.
