Studies have confirmed that anxiety, especially worry and rumination, are associated with increased risk for cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD).
Hippocampal atrophy is a hallmark of ADRD.
We investigated the association between hippocampus and its subfield volumes and late-life global anxiety, worry, and rumination, and emotion regulation strategies.
We recruited 110 participants with varying worry severity who underwent magnetic resonance imaging and clinical interviews.
We conducted cross-sectional regression analysis between each subfield and anxiety, worry, rumination, reappraisal, and suppression while adjusting for age, sex, race, education, cumulative illness burden, stress, neuroticism, and intracranial volume.
We imputed missing data and corrected for multiple comparisons across regions.
Greater worry was associated with smaller subiculum volume, whereas greater use of reappraisal was associated with larger subiculum and CA1 volume.
Greater worry may be detrimental to the hippocampus and to subfields involved in early ADRD pathology.
Use of reappraisal appears protective of hippocampal structure.
Worry and reappraisal may be modifiable targets for ADRD prevention.
