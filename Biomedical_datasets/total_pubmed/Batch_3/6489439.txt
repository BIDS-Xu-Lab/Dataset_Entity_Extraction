Rats trained to discriminate intraperitoneal injections of 0.16 mg/kg LSD from saline injections were found to show stimulus generalization with 0.31-5 mg/kg of yohimbine.
Partial generalization also occurred with clonidine and xylazine.
Rats discriminating intraperitoneal injections of 5 mg/kg of yohimbine from saline generalized LSD at doses of 0.08-0.63 mg/kg.
The data establish an equivalence between LSD and yohimbine as to discriminative effects in rats.
This equivalence is consistent with LSD and yohimbine producing at least partly similar subjective effects in humans.
