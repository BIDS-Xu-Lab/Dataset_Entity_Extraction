A 39-year-old male presented with gross hematuria and left lower abdominal discomfort.
Excretory urography showed a left ureteral stone and hydronephrosis.
CT scans and magnetic resonance imaging showed a solid mass at the upper pole of the left kidney.
Angiography revealed a hypervascular lesion at this area.
The laboratory data showed a slightly decreased serum potassium level.
In the endocrinological study, the serum deoxycorticosterone (DOC) level was markedly elevated.
There was, however, no evidence of hypertension.
The operation was performed on November 13, 1992.
The tumor was almost separated from the left kidney, but an aberrant artery which divided from the renal artery and penetrated the renal parenchyma was found.
Therefore, we had to carry out en bloc removal of the tumor together with the left kidney and the ureter which contained the ureteral stone.
After the operation, hypokalemia and the serum concentration of DOC returned to normal range.
Therefore, the tumor was diagnosed as DOC producing adrenocortical carcinoma.
The patient was discharged 30 days after the operation with uneventful postoperative course.
He received 2.5 g of op'-DDD a day.
There was no evidence of distant metastasis or local recurrence 12 months after the operation.
Nineteen cases of DOC producing adrenocortical tumor have been reported in the world literature.
A case and a review of the literature are herein reported.
