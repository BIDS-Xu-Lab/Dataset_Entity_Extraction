In the past decade, since the innovation of the smartphone, there has been an increase in depression, anxiety, and suicidality among teenagers and young adults.
The objective of this article was to review the current evidence for these associations and to provide initial clinical guidance.
A narrative review of the available literature on digital technology, social media, and psychiatric outcomes in adolescents.
Psychiatric outcomes have worsened in adolescents in the past decade, correlating with the invention of the smartphone and the rise of social media.
Depressive symptoms among American teenagers rose rapidly around 2012 and now are reported in 22% of adolescents, which is at least double the rate in adults.
Suicide rates have risen, especially among teenage girls in the United States, in whom there has been a doubling of completed suicide in the past decade.
A causal relationship between social media use and these harmful psychiatric outcomes is supported by emerging randomized data showing reduced depressive symptoms associated with a decrease in social media use in college students.
Social media and digital technology correlate with harmful psychiatric outcomes in adolescents and young adults.
