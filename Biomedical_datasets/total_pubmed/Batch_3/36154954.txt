The pharmacist's role in vaccination efforts continues to increase; therefore, it is essential to ensure that pharmacy students receive effective training to be confident and competent administering immunizations.
The purpose of this research was to assess the impact of immunization training timing on students' hands-on experience and perception during pharmacy school.
One hundred forty-five pharmacy schools were surveyed to determine details of their immunization training programs.
A follow-up survey was sent to select schools to determine student comfort immunizing during introductory pharmacy practice experiences (IPPEs) and paid employment in pharmacy settings.
Quantitative data regarding the number of immunizations delivered during IPPEs and work was collected.
Questions also assessed attitudes regarding timing of immunization training and missed opportunities to immunize.
Results indicated students trained during their third professional year (PY3) were less comfortable giving immunizations during their IPPEs or work than those trained during the first professional year (PY1) or second professional year (PY2) (IPPE P < .01;
PY3s were more likely to prefer training earlier in the curriculum.
PY2s and PY3s were more likely to believe the timing of their immunization training caused missed opportunities to deliver immunizations.
The earlier the immunization training occurred in the curriculum, the more vaccinations the student administered.
Providing immunization training programs to pharmacy students earlier in their curriculum provides students with superior experience and instills confidence.
