Specific immunochemical techniques were used to quantitate the levels of eight isozymes of cytochrome P-450 (P-450) and epoxide hydrolase in liver microsomes of untreated rats and rats treated with phenobarbital, 3-methylcholanthrene, a mixture of these two compounds, nine individual polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) congeners, and a commercial mixture of PBBs.
Levels of two 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible P-450s (designated P-450 beta NF-B and P-450 beta NF/ISF-G) varied over two orders of magnitude and were highly correlated.
The levels of four phenobarbital-inducible P-450s (designated P-450PB-B, P-450PB-C, P-450PB-D, and P-450PB/PCN-E) were all correlated to each other.
The level of one form, P-450UT-A, which was present at substantial levels in untreated rats, was inversely correlated to the levels of P-450 beta NF-B and P-450 beta NF/ISF-G. Among the PBB congeners which were examined, the presence of bromine at carbons o to the biphenyl bridge favored the induction of P-450PB-B, P-450PB-C, P-450PG-D, and P-450PB/PCN-E but did not necessarily eliminate the ability to induce P-450 beta NF-B and P-450 beta NF-ISF-G. PBB congeners with 2,2'-dibromo substitution induced P-450 beta NF-B and P-450 beta NF/ISF-G if one of the biphenyl rings contained bromines at positions 2,3, and 4.
The induction of P-450UT-F was found to occur to a small extent with three of the compounds and is not readily explained in terms of structure-activity relationships.
Although correlations were found among levels of some of the forms of P-450, several important exceptions were noted in relative levels of the individual enzymes.
While the correlative data are useful in predicting induction patterns, all eight forms of P-450 appear to be independently regulated to some extent.
