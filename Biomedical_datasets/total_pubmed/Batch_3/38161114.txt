Metabolic syndrome (MetS) defines important risk factors in the development of cardiovascular diseases and other serious health conditions.
This study aims to investigate the influence of different dietary patterns on MetS and its components, examining both associations and predictive performance.
The study sample included 10,750 participants from the seventh survey of the cross-sectional, population-based Troms√∏ Study in Norway.
Diet intake scores were used as covariates in logistic regression models, controlling for age, educational level and other lifestyle variables, with MetS and its components as response variables.
A diet high in meat and sweets was positively associated with increased odds of MetS and elevated waist circumference, while a plant-based diet was associated with decreased odds of hypertension in women and elevated levels of triglycerides in men.
The predictive power of dietary patterns derived by different dimensionality reduction techniques was investigated by randomly partitioning the study sample into training and test sets.
On average, the diet score variables demonstrated the highest predictive power in predicting MetS and elevated waist circumference.
The predictive power was robust to the dimensionality reduction technique used and comparable to using a data-driven prediction method on individual food variables.
The strongest associations and highest predictive power of dietary patterns were observed for MetS and its single component, elevated waist circumference.
