Coxiella burnetii is the etiological agent of Q fever.
Currently, the Netherlands is facing the largest Q fever epidemic ever, with almost 4,000 notified human cases.
Although the presence of a hypervirulent strain is hypothesized, epidemiological evidence, such as the animal reservoir(s) and genotype of the C. burnetii strain(s) involved, is still lacking.
We developed a single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) genotyping assay directly applicable to clinical samples.
Ten discriminatory SNPs were carefully selected and detected by real-time PCR.
SNP genotyping appeared to be highly suitable for discrimination of C. burnetii strains and easy to perform with clinical samples.
With this new method, we show that the Dutch outbreak is caused by at least 5 different C. burnetii genotypes.
SNP typing of 14 human samples from the outbreak revealed the presence of 3 dissimilar genotypes.
Two genotypes were also present in livestock at 9 farms in the outbreak area.
SNP analyses of bulk milk from 5 other farms, commercial cow milk, and cow colostrum revealed 2 additional genotypes that were not detected in humans.
SNP genotyping data from clinical samples clearly demonstrate that at least 5 different C. burnetii genotypes are involved in the Dutch outbreak.
