        "abstract": "Parent, teacher, and peer ratings were collected for 75 grade school boys to test the hypothesis that certain family interaction patterns would be associated with poor peer relations. Path analyses provided support for a mediational model, in which punitive and ineffective discipline was related to child conduct problems in home and school settings which, in turn, predicted poor peer relations. Further analyses suggested that distinct subgroups of boys could be identified who exhibited conduct problems at home only, at school only, in both settings, or in neither setting. Boys who exhibited cross-situational conduct problems were more likely to experience multiple concurrent problems (e.g., in both home and school settings) and were more likely than any other group to experience poor peer relations. However, only about one-third of the boys with poor peer relations in this sample exhibited problem profiles consistent with the proposed model (e.g., experienced high rates of punitive/ineffective home discipline and exhibited conduct problems in home and school settings), suggesting that the proposed model reflects one common (but not exclusive) pathway to poor peer relations.",

        "abstract": "A1 adenosine receptors (A1AR) acting via the inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding protein inhibit adenylate cyclase activity in brain, cardiac, and adipose tissue. We now report the purification of the A1AR from bovine cerebral cortex. This A1AR is distinct from other A1ARs in that it displays an agonist potency series of N6-R-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA) greater than N6-S-phenylisopropyladenosine greater than (S-PIA) greater than 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) compared to the traditional potency series of R-PIA greater than NECA greater than S-PIA. The A1AR was solubilized in 1% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (Chaps) and then purified by chromatography on an antagonist [xanthine amine congener (XAC)]-coupled Affi-Gel 10 followed by hydroxylapatite chromatography. Following purification, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a single protein of Mr 36,000 by silver staining, Na125I iodination with chloramine T and photoaffinity labeling with [125I]8-[4-[[[[2-(4-aminophenyl acetylamino) ethyl] carbonyl] methyl] oxy]-phenyl]-1,3- dipropylxanthine. This single protein displayed all the characteristics of the A1AR, including binding an antagonist radioligand [( 3H]XAC) with high affinity (Kd = 0.7 nM) and in a saturable manner (Bmax greater than 4500 pmol/mg). Agonist competition curves demonstrated the expected bovine brain A1AR pharmacology: R-PIA greater than S-PIA greater than NECA. The overall yield from soluble preparation was 7%. The glycoprotein nature of the purified A1AR was determined with endo- and exoglycosidases. Deglycosylation with endoglycosidase F increased the mobility of the A1AR from Mr 36,000 to Mr 32,000 in a single step. The A1AR was sensitive to neuraminidase but resistant to alpha-mannosidase, suggesting the single carbohydrate chain was of the complex type. This makes the bovine brain A1AR similar to rat brain and fat A1AR in terms of its carbohydrate chains yet the purified A1AR retains its unique agonist potency series observed in membranes.",

        "abstract": "A series of 28 adenosine analogs and 17 xanthines has been assessed as inhibitors of binding of N6-R-[3H]phenylisopropyladenosine binding to A1 adenosine receptors in membranes from rat, calf, and guinea pig brain. Potencies of N6-alkyl- and N6-cycloalkyladenosines are similar in the different species. However, the presence of an aryl or heteroaryl moiety in the N6 substituent results in marked species differences with certain such analogs being about 30-fold more potent at receptors in calf than in guinea pig brain. Potencies at receptors in rat brain are intermediate. Conversely, 2-chloroadenosine and 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine are about 10-fold less potent at receptors in calf brain than in guinea pig brain. Potencies of xanthines, such as theophylline, caffeine and 1,3-dipropylxanthine are similar in the different species. However, the presence of an 8-phenyl or 8-cycloalkyl substituent results in marked species differences. For example, a xanthine amine conjugate of 1,3-dipropyl-8-phenylxanthine is 9-fold more potent at receptors in calf than in rat brain and 110-fold more potent in calf than in guinea pig brain. Such differences indicate that brain A1 adenosine receptors are not identical in recognition sites for either agonists or antagonists in different mammalian species.",

        "abstract": "We recently reported that reconstitution of lethally irradiated B10 mouse recipients with 40 x 10(6) untreated WF rat bone marrow cells resulted in stable fully xenogeneic chimerism (WF rat----B10 mouse). In these animals, the tolerance induced for skin xenografts was highly MHC specific in that donor-specific WF rat skin grafts were significantly prolonged while MHC-disparate third-party xenografts were rapidly rejected (median survival time [MST] = 9 days). We have now examined whether islet cell xenografts placed under the renal capsule of chimeras rendered diabetic with streptozotocin would be accepted and remain functional to maintain euglycemia. Animals were prepared, typed for chimerism at 6 weeks, and diabetes induced with streptozotocin. Donor-specific WF (Rt1Au) islet cell xenografts were significantly prolonged (MST greater than 180 days) in WF----B10 chimeras, while MHC-disparate third-party F344 rat (Rt1A1) grafts were rejected with a time course similar to unmanipulated B10 mice (MST = 8 days). The transplanted donor-specific islet cells were functional to maintain euglycemia, since removal of the grafts at from 100 to 180 days in selected individual chimeras uniformly resulted in return of the diabetic state. These data suggest that donor-specific islet cell xenografts are accepted and remain functional in mice rendered tolerant to rat xenoantigens following bone marrow transplantation.",

        "abstract": "Two classes of 8-substituted analogs of theophylline (1,3-dialkylxanthines), having 8-cycloalkyl, 8-cycloalkenyl or 8-(para-substituted aryl) groups, were shown to be potent and, in some cases, receptor subtype selective antagonists at A1- and A2-adenosine receptors. New analogs based on a functionalized cogener approach and on classical medicinal chemical approaches were prepared. Affinity at A1-adenosine receptors was evaluated by inhibition of binding of [3H]N6-phenylisopropyladenosine to rat brain membranes. Activity at A2-adenosine receptors was measured by the reversal of 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA)-stimulated production of cyclic AMP in membranes from rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Cycloalkenyl analogs containing rigid olefinic bonds differed greatly in potency from the saturated analogs. The selectivity of phenylsulfonamide analogs depended on distal structural features. Novel xanthine analogs include diamino-, thiol-, aldehyde, and halogen-substituted derivatives, peptide conjugates of 8-[4-[2-aminoethylaminocarbonylmethyloxy]phenyl]1,3-dipropylxan thi ne (XAC), and a hydroxyethylamide analog of XAC.",

        "abstract": "Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the latent cytoplasmic transcription factor, Stat1, which then forms homodimers, translocates to the nucleus and participates in IFN-gamma-induced transcription. However, little is known of the interactions between Stat1 and the general transcription machinery during transcriptional activation. We show here that Stat1 can directly interact with the CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 family of transcriptional coactivators. Specifically, two interaction regions were identified: the amino-terminal region of Stat1 interacts with the CREB-binding domain of CBP/p300 and the carboxyl-terminal region of Stat1 interacts with the domain of CBP/p300 that binds adenovirus E1A protein. Transfection experiments suggest a role for these interactions in IFN-gamma-induced transcription. Because CBP/p300-binding is required for the adenovirus E1A protein to regulate transcription of many genes during viral replication and cellular transformation, it is possible that the anti-viral effect of IFN-gamma is based at least in part on direct competition by nuclear Stat1 with E1A for CBP/p300 binding.",

        "title": "Effect of genetic background on the contribution of New Zealand black loci to autoimmune lupus nephritis.",
        "abstract": "Autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus are complex genetic traits with contributions from major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes and multiple unknown non-MHC genes. Studies of animal models of lupus have provided important insight into the immunopathogenesis of disease, and genetic analyses of these models overcome certain obstacles encountered when studying human patients. Genome-wide scans of different genetic crosses have been used to map several disease-linked loci in New Zealand hybrid mice. Although some consensus exists among studies mapping the New Zealand Black (NZB) and New Zealand White (NZW) loci that contribute to lupus-like disease, considerable variability is also apparent. A variable in these studies is the genetic background of the non-autoimmune strain, which could influence genetic contributions from the affected strain. A direct examination of this question was undertaken in the present study by mapping NZB nephritis-linked loci in backcrosses involving different non-autoimmune backgrounds. In a backcross with MHC-congenic C57BL/6J mice, H2z appeared to be the strongest genetic determinant of severe lupus nephritis, whereas in a backcross with congenic BALB/cJ mice, H2z showed no influence on disease expression. NZB loci on chromosomes 1, 4, 11, and 14 appeared to segregate with disease in the BALB/cJ cross, but only the influence of the chromosome 1 locus spanned both crosses and showed linkage with disease when all mice were considered. Thus, the results indicate that contributions from disease-susceptibility loci, including MHC, may vary markedly depending on the non-autoimmune strain used in a backcross analysis. These studies provide insight into variables that affect genetic heterogeneity and add an important dimension of complexity for linkage analyses of human autoimmune disease.",

        "abstract": "Chronic ingestion of caffeine by male NIH Swiss strain mice leads in about 3 days to a significant increase in A1-adenosine, nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, and a significant decrease of beta 1-adrenoceptors in cerebral cortical membranes. Plasma levels of caffeine in the chronically treated mice range from 0.70 to 5.7 micrograms/ml. The changes in receptors reverse after withdrawal of caffeine within 7 days. An increase in nitrendipine binding sites, associated with L-type calcium channels, also occurs within 4 days and has reversed in 7 days after withdrawal. There is no change in the levels of striatal nicotinic receptors of D2-dopamine receptors, nor of [3H]cocaine binding to dopamine uptake sites. Levels of opioid receptors are either increased (delta) or unaltered (mu, kappa). sigma-Receptors are unaltered. Stimulations of striatal adenylate cyclase by forskolin, dopamine and NECA are not significantly affected after chronic caffeine ingestion. The adenosine agonist, NECA, reverses the amphetamine-elicited increases in locomotor activity and partly reverses the cocaine-elicited increases. The NECA dose-response curve is multiphasic (depression, stimulation and then depression) versus amphetamine in control mice, but only depressant versus amphetamine in chronic caffeine mice, while being multiphasic versus cocaine in both control and chronic caffeine mice. NECA reverses the stimulation of locomotor activity elicited by the muscarinic antagonist, scopolamine, and is more effective in the chronic caffeine mice. The behavioral depressant effects of the muscarinic agonist, oxotremorine, are not markedly altered after chronic caffeine ingestion.",

        "abstract": "It has been demonstrated that CD8+ T cells produce a soluble factor(s) that suppresses human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) replication in CD4+ T cells. The role of soluble factors in the suppression of HIV replication in monocyte/macrophages (M/M) has not been fully delineated. To investigate whether a CD8+ T-cell-derived soluble factor(s) can also suppress HIV infection in the M/M system, primary macrophages were infected with the macrophage tropic HIV-1 strain Ba-L. CD8+ T-cell-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells were also infected with HIV-1 IIIB or Ba-L. HIV expression from the chronically infected macrophage cell line U1 was also determined in the presence of CD8+ T-cell supernatants or beta-chemokines. We demonstrate that: (i) CD8+ T-cell supernatants did, but beta-chemokines did not, suppress HIV replication in the M/M system; (ii) antibodies to regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and Secreted (RANTES), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) and MIP-1 beta did not, whereas antibodies to interleukin 10, interleukin 13, interferon alpha, or interferon gamma modestly reduced anti-HIV activity of the CD8+ T-cell supernatants; and (iii) the CD8+ T-cell supernatants did, but beta-chemokines did not, suppress HIV-1 IIIB replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as HIV expression in U1 cells. These results suggest that HIV-suppressor activity of CD8+ T cells is a multifactorial phenomenon, and that RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta do not account for the entire scope of CD8+ T-cell-derived HIV-suppressor factors.",

        "abstract": "Motifs of neural circuitry seem surprisingly conserved over different areas of neocortex or of paleocortex, while performing quite different sensory processing tasks. This apparent paradox may be resolved by the fact that seemingly different problems in sensory information processing are related by transformations (changes of variables) that convert one problem into another. The same basic algorithm that is appropriate to the recognition of a known odor quality, independent of the strength of the odor, can be used to recognize a vocalization (e.g., a spoken syllable), independent of whether it is spoken quickly or slowly. To convert one problem into the other, a new representation of time sequences is needed. The time that has elapsed since a recent event must be represented in neural activity. The electrophysiological hallmarks of cells that are involved in generating such a representation of time are discussed. The anatomical relationships between olfactory and auditory pathways suggest relevant experiments. The neurophysiological mechanism for the psychophysical logarithmic encoding of time duration would be of direct use for interconverting olfactory and auditory processing problems. Such reuse of old algorithms in new settings and representations is related to the way that evolution develops new biochemistry.",

        "abstract": "T cells recognize antigen by formation of a trimolecular complex in which the T-cell receptor (TCR) recognizes a specific peptide antigen within the groove of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. It has generally been assumed that T-cell recognition of two distinct MHC-antigen complexes is due to similarities in the three-dimensional structure of the complexes. Here we report results of experiments examining the crossreactivity of TCRs recognizing the myelin basic protein peptide MBPp85-99 and several of its analogs in the context of MHC. We demonstrate that single conservative amino acid substitutions of the antigenic peptide at the predominant TCR contact residues at positions 91 and 93 totally abrogate reactivity of specific T-cell clones. Yet, when a conservative substitution is made at position 91 concomitant with a substitution at position 93, the T-cell clones regain reactivity equivalent with that of the original stimulating peptide. Thus, the exact nature of the amino acid side chains engaging one TCR functional pocket may change the apparent selectivity of the other predominant TCR functional pocket, thus suggesting a remarkable degree of receptor plasticity. This ability of the TCR-MHC-peptide complex to undergo conformational changes provides a conceptual framework for reconciling the apparent paradox of the extreme selectivity of the TCR and its remarkable crossreactivity with different MHC-peptide complexes.",

        "abstract": "To understand the role of the immune system in limiting HIV type 1 replication, it is critical to know to what extent the rapid turnover of productively infected cells is caused by viral cytopathicity or by immune-mediated lysis. We show that uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells of many patients contain cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) that lyse target cells-at plausible peripheral blood mononuclear cell-to-target ratios-with half-lives of less than 1 day. In 23 patients with CD4 counts ranging from 10 to 900 per microliter, the average rate of CTL-mediated lysis corresponds to a target cell half-life of 0.7 day. We develop mathematical models to calculate the turnover rate of infected cells subjected to immune-mediated lysis and viral cytopathicity and to estimate the fraction of cells that are killed by CTL as opposed to virus. The models provide new interpretations of drug treatment dynamics and explain why the observed rate of virus decline is roughly constant for different patients. We conclude that in HIV type 1 infection, CTL-mediated lysis can reduce virus load by limiting virus production, with small effects on the half-life of infected cells.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to undertake a critical review of the potential role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of low back pain (LBP) and to determine if there were differences in the MRI appearances between various occupational groups. The study group, 149 working men (78 aged 20-30 years and 71 aged 31-58 years) from five different occupations (car production workers, ambulance men, office staff, hospital porters and brewery draymen), underwent MRI of the lumbar spine. Thirty-four percent of the subjects had never experienced LBP. Twelve months later, the examination was repeated on 89 men. Age-related differences were seen in the MRI appearances of the lumbar spine. Disc degeneration was most common at L5/S1 and was significantly more prevalent (P < 0.01) in the older age group (52%) than in the younger age group (27%). Although LBP was more prevalent in the older subjects there was no relationship between LBP and disc degeneration. No differences in the MRI appearance of the lumbar spine were observed between the five occupational groups. Overall, 45% had 'abnormal' lumbar spines (evidence of disc degeneration, disc bulging or protrusion, facet hypertrophy, or nerve root compression). There was not a clear relationship between the MRI appearance of the lumbar spine and LBP. Thirty-two percent of asymptomatic subjects had 'abnormal' lumbar spines and 47% of all the subjects who had experienced LBP had 'normal' lumbar spines. During the 12-month follow-up period, 13 subjects experienced LBP for the first time. However, there was no change in the MRI appearances of their lumbar spines that could account for the onset of LBP. Although MRI is an excellent technique for evaluating the lumbar spine, this study shows that it does not provide a suitable pre-employment screening technique capable of identifying those at risk of LBP.",

Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that CCE channels are formed of subunits encoded in genes related to the Drosophila trp gene. The first step in this pursuit was to search for mammalian trp genes. We found not one but six mammalian genes and cloned several of their cDNAs, some in their full length. As assayed in mammalian cells, overexpression of some mammalian Trps increases CCE, while expression of partial trp cDNAs in antisense orientation can interfere with endogenous CCE. These findings provided a firm connection between CCE and mammalian Trps. This article reviews the known forms of CCE and highlights unanswered questions in our understanding of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and the physiological roles of CCE.",

        "title": "Vertebral body MRI related to lumbar fusion results.",
        "abstract": "The evaluation of continued pain after a technically successful posterolateral lumbar spine fusion is often challenging. Although the intervertebral disc is often a source of low back pain, abnormal endplates may also be a focus of pain, and possibly a source of continued pain after a posterolateral fusion. MRI allows noninvasive evaluation for disc degeneration, as well as for abnormal endplates and adjacent vertebral body marrow. Previous studies have found inflammatory marrow changes, adjacent to abnormal endplates, associated with disc degeneration in low back pain patients. In this study, preoperative MRI scans in 89 posterolateral lumbar fusion patients were reviewed, by an independent radiologist, to determine whether vertebral body marrow changes adjacent to the endplates were related to continued pain. Independent chart review and follow-up telephone interview of all patients at a 4-year follow-up (mean) formed the basis for the clinical results. Vertebral body MRI signals consistent with inflammatory or fatty changes were found in 38% of patients, and always occurred adjacent to a degenerated disc. Inflammatory MRI vertebral body changes were significantly related to continued low back pain at P = 0.03. We conclude that posterolateral lumber fusion has a less predictable result for the subset of degenerative disc patients with abnormal endplates and associated marrow inflammation. More research is needed to determine the biological and biomechanical effects of posterolateral fusion upon the endplate within the fused segments. If indeed further study supports the hypothesis that abnormal endplates associated with inflammation are a source of pain, then treating the endplates directly by anterior fusion may be a preferred treatment for this subset of degenerative patients.",

Twenty patients had syringomyelia, 19 had Chiari malformation. Scoliosis was the only presenting symptom when all these patients were referred to the orthopaedic surgeon. On examination, five patients had normal neurological findings, while the others showed very mild neurological deficits. The diagnosis of syringomyelia and Chiari malformation was established by MRI, which is the best form of neuroradiological examination for discovering spinal abnormalities. Neurosurgical treatment is strongly recommended as the first step in the management of \"pseudo\" idiopathic scoliosis.",

An anterolateral transthoracic approach at the upper-most affected level was selected for removal of all herniated discs, with the use of a surgical microscope; the resected rib was used for intervertebral fusion. An improvement in the patient's subjective and neurological condition was already apparent a few months after the operation, and solid fusion was roentgenographically found at all operated levels.

The role of HLA-DQB1 allele disparity in this clinical setting is unknown. To elucidate the biological importance of HLA-DQB1, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 449 HLA-A, -B, and -DR serologically matched unrelated donor transplants. Molecular typing of HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 alleles revealed 335 DRB1 and DQB1 matched pairs; 41 DRB1 matched and DQB1 mismatched pairs; 48 DRB1 mismatched and DQB1 matched pairs; and 25 DRB1 and DQB1 mismatched pairs. The conditional probabilities of grades III-IV acute GVHD were 0.42, 0.61, 0.55, and 0.71, respectively. The relative risk of acute GVHD associated with a single locus HLA-DQB1 mismatch was 1.8 (1.1, 2.7; P = 0.01), and the risk associated with any HLA-DQB1 and/or HLA-DRB1 mismatch was 1.6 (1.2, 2.2; P = 0.003). These results provide evidence that HLA-DQ is a transplant antigen and suggest that evaluation of both HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1 is necessary in selecting potential donors.",

        "abstract": "Primary HIV-1 isolates were evaluated for their sensitivity to inhibition by beta-chemokines RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), and MIP-1 beta. Virus isolates of both nonsyncytium-inducing (NSI) and syncytium-inducing (SI) biological phenotypes recovered from patients at various stages of HIV-1 infection were assessed, and the results indicated that only the isolates with the NSI phenotype were substantially inhibited by the beta-chemokines. More important to note, these data demonstrate that resistance to inhibition by beta-chemokines RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta is not restricted to T cell line-adapted SI isolates but is also a consistent property among primary SI isolates. Analysis of isolates obtained sequentially from infected individuals in whom viruses shifted from NSI to SI phenotype during clinical progression exhibited a parallel loss of sensitivity to beta-chemokines. Loss of virus sensitivity to inhibition by beta-chemokines RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta was furthermore associated with changes in the third variable (V3) region amino acid residues previously described to correlate with a shift of virus phenotype from NSI to SI. Of interest, an intermediate V3 genotype correlated with a partial inhibition by the beta-chemokines. In addition, we also identified viruses sensitive to RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta of NSI phenotype that were isolated from individuals with AIDS manifestations, indicating that loss of sensitivity to beta-chemokine inhibition and shift in viral phenotype are not necessarily prerequisites for the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection.",

        "abstract": "The stress neurohormone corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) activates at least two receptor types. Expression of corticotropin releasing factor receptor type II (CRF2) has been demonstrated in the hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus (VMH) of the adult and developing rat, but the physiological functions of VMH-CRF2 have not been elucidated. The VMH has been documented as an important participant in the regulation of food intake and its interactions with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and circadian rhythms. Regulation of VMH-CRF2 may thus play a role in the interplay of physiological alterations in metabolic state with the neuroendocrine and anorexic effects of CRF. This study determined the regulation of CRF2-mRNA expression in infant rats by the physiological consequences of maternal deprivation, i.e., fasting and stress. Using in situ hybridization, maternally deprived pups had an average 62% reduction of VMH-CRF2-mRNA levels compared with stress-free controls. Maternal deprivation also resulted in elevated plasma corticosterone levels (3.8 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.1 microg/dl) and an average 5.7% body weight loss. This study demonstrates that maternal deprivation, via fasting and HPA activation, leads to a dramatic decrease of CRF2-mRNA levels in the VMH. These results are consistent with a role for CRF2 activation in mediating some of the complex interactions of CRF (or urocortin) with regulation of food intake in the developing rat.",

To assess whether additional segments of the PrP molecule can be deleted, we previously removed regions of putative secondary structure in PrPC; in the present study we found that deletion of each of the four predicted helices prevented PrPSc formation, as did deletion of the stop transfer effector region and the C178A mutation. Removal of a 36-residue loop between helices 2 and 3 did not prevent formation of protease-resistant PrP; the resulting scrapie-like protein, designated PrPSc106, contained 106 residues after cleavage of an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal sequence for glycolipid anchor addition. Addition of the detergent Sarkosyl to cell lysates solubilized PrPSc106, which retained resistance to digestion by proteinase K. These results suggest that all the regions of proposed secondary structure in PrP are required for PrPSc formation, as is the disulfide bond stabilizing helices 3 and 4. The discovery of PrPSc106 should facilitate structural studies of PrPSc, investigations of the mechanism of PrPSc formation, and the production of PrPSc-specific antibodies.",

Mutants lacking all or part of the 3' terminal conserved region or the poly(U-UC) region were unable to infect the chimpanzee, indicating that both regions are critical for infectivity in vivo. However, the third region, the variable region, was able to tolerate a deletion that destroyed the two putative stem-loop structures within this region. Mutant VR-24 containing a deletion of the proximal 24 nt of the variable region of the 3' UTR was viable in the chimpanzee and seemed to replicate as well as the undeleted parent virus. The chimpanzee became viremic 1 week after inoculation with mutant VR-24, and the HCV genome titer increased over time during the early acute infection. Therefore, the poly(U-UC) region and the conserved region, but not the variable region, of the 3' UTR seem to be critical for in vivo infectivity of HCV.",

        "title": "Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase gene disruption conferred mice resistant to streptozotocin-induced diabetes.",
        "abstract": "Streptozotocin (STZ), a glucose analogue known to induce diabetes in experimental animals, causes DNA strand breaks and subsequent activation of poly(ADPribose) polymerase (Parp). Because Parp uses NAD as a substrate, extensive DNA damage will result in reduction of cellular NAD level. In fact, STZ induces NAD depletion and cell death in isolated pancreatic islets in vitro. Activation of Parp therefore is thought to play an important role in STZ-induced diabetes. In the present study, we established Parp-deficient (Parp-/-) mice by disrupting Parp exon 1 by using the homologous recombination technique. These mice were used to examine the possible involvement of Parp in STZ-induced beta-cell damage in vivo. The wild-type (Parp+/+) mice showed significant increases in blood glucose concentration from 129 mg/dl to 218, 370, 477, and 452 mg/dl on experimental days 1, 7, 21, and 60, respectively, after a single injection of 180 mg STZ/kg body weight. In contrast, the concentration of blood glucose in Parp-/- mice remained normal up to day 7, slightly increased on day 21, but returned to normal levels on day 60. STZ injection caused extensive necrosis in the islets of Parp+/+ mice on day 1, with subsequent progressive islet atrophy and loss of functional beta cells from day 7. In contrast, the extent of islet beta-cell death and dysfunction was markedly less in Parp-/- mice. Our findings clearly implicate Parp activation in islet beta-cell damage and glucose intolerance induced by STZ in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Auditory filial imprinting in the domestic chicken is accompanied by a dramatic loss of spine synapses in two higher associative forebrain areas, the mediorostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale (MNH) and the dorsocaudal neostriatum (Ndc). The cellular mechanisms that underlie this learning-induced synaptic reorganization are unclear. We found that local pharmacological blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the MNH, a manipulation that has been shown previously to impair auditory imprinting, suppresses the learning-induced spine reduction in this region. Chicks treated with the NMDA receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) during the behavioral training for imprinting (postnatal day 0-2) displayed similar spine frequencies at postnatal day 7 as naive control animals, which, in both groups, were significantly higher than in imprinted animals. Because the average dendritic length did not differ between the experimental groups, the reduced spine frequency can be interpreted as a reduction of the total number of spine synapses per neuron. In the Ndc, which is reciprocally connected with the MNH and not directly influenced by the injected drug, learning-induced spine elimination was partly suppressed. Spine frequencies of the APV-treated, behaviorally trained but nonimprinted animals were higher than in the imprinted animals but lower than in the naive animals. These results provide evidence that NMDA receptor activation is required for the learning-induced selective reduction of spine synapses, which may serve as a mechanism of information storage specific for juvenile emotional learning events.",

Traditional ownership financing options in the form of direct purchase or financing (loan) have several limitations including technology obsolescence, higher fixed pricing, limited options for equipment disposal, and the need to tie up valuable capital. Alternative financing options, in the form of conventional lease and risk sharing arrangements, offer several theoretical advantages including technology obsolescence protection in the form of built-in upgrades, preservation of borrowing power, multiple end-of-term options, and payment flexibility (which can be directly tied to realized productivity and operational efficiency gains).

The pathologies differed in severity and were treated by diskectomy or by extended corporectomy using the Senegas technique. Intraoperative SEP changes were recorded in 84 patients (40%); in 13 (6.2%) of these, changes in SEP amplitude and latency were caused by mechanical stress. SEPs revealed transient episodes of regional ischaemia or neurophysiological anomalies during anaesthesia (mainly hypotension) in 27 patients (12.8%). The traces detected incipient and potentially dangerous mechanical pressure on, or metabolic anomalies of, the spinal cord during manipulation and placement procedures of spinal fixation devices. They were particularly sensitive indicators of ischaemia; one of the most common causes of irreversible injury. The traces of 44 patients (21.0%) improved markedly during surgery. There were no false-negatives in this series and, thanks to the fact that SEPs gave immediate warnings of incipient ischaemia to the surgical team, we had no case of irreversible medullary or nerve-root deficit.",

The flavodoxin-like flavin domain is positioned at the proximal face of the heme domain with the FMN 4.0 and 18.4 A from the peptide that precedes the heme-binding loop and the heme iron, respectively. The heme-binding peptide represents the most efficient and coupled through-bond electron pathway to the heme iron. Substantial differences between the FMN-binding domains of P450BM-3 and microsomal P450 reductase, observed around the flavin-binding sites, are responsible for different redox properties of the FMN, which, in turn, control electron flow to the P450.",

        "abstract": "The nervous system maintains a delicate balance between excitation and inhibition, partly through the complex interplay between voltage-gated sodium and potassium ion channels. Because K+ channel blockade or gene deletion causes hyperexcitability, it is generally assumed that increases in K+ channel gene expression should reduce neuronal network excitability. We have tested this hypothesis by creating a transgenic mouse that expresses a Shaker-type K+ channel gene. Paradoxically, we find that addition of the extra K+ channel gene results in a hyperexcitable rather than a hypoexcitable phenotype. The presence of the transgene leads to a complex deregulation of endogenous Shaker genes in the adult central nervous system as well as an increase in network excitability that includes spontaneous cortical spike and wave discharges and a lower threshold for epileptiform bursting in isolated hippocampal slices. These data suggest that an increase in K+ channel gene dosage leads to dysregulation of normal K+ channel gene expression, and it may underlie a mechanism contributing to the pathogenesis of human aneuploidies such as Down syndrome.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in the human presenilin genes PS1 and PS2 cause early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Studies in Caenorhabditis elegans and in mice indicate that one function of presenilin genes is to facilitate Notch-pathway signaling. Notably, mutations in the C. elegans presenilin gene sel-12 reduce signaling through an activated version of the Notch receptor LIN-12. To investigate the function of a second C. elegans presenilin gene hop-1 and to examine possible genetic interactions between hop-1 and sel-12, we used a reverse genetic strategy to isolate deletion alleles of both loci. Animals bearing both hop-1 and sel-12 deletions displayed new phenotypes not observed in animals bearing either single deletion. These new phenotypes-germ-line proliferation defects, maternal-effect embryonic lethality, and somatic gonad defects-resemble those resulting from a reduction in signaling through the C. elegans Notch receptors GLP-1 and LIN-12. Thus SEL-12 and HOP-1 appear to function redundantly in promoting Notch-pathway signaling. Phenotypic analyses of hop-1 and sel-12 single and double mutant animals suggest that sel-12 provides more presenilin function than does hop-1.",

To do this successfully, one must be able to perform technology assessment and capital equipment asset management. The lack of a commercial system that adequately performed technology needs assessment and addressed the unique needs of the military led to the development of an in-house Technology Assessment and Requirements Analysis (TARA) program. The TARA is a tool that provides an unbiased review of clinical operations and the resulting capital equipment requirements for military hospitals. The TARA report allows for the development of acquisition strategies for new equipment, enhances personnel management, and improves and streamlines clinical operations and processes.",

        "abstract": "T-cell responses can be antagonized by some single amino acid-substituted analogs of a peptide ligand for T-cell receptors (TCR), and these are called TCR antagonists. In this study, we addressed the question of whether TCR antagonism can be elicited by a whole protein antigen carrying a mutated T-cell determinant region corresponding to a TCR antagonist peptide. To clarify this, we examined the ability of a single amino acid-substituted mutant form of bovine beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg) to inhibit three CD4+ T-cell clones recognizing a peptide corresponding to an immunodominant determinant region 119-133 of beta-Lg (p119-133). First, we identified pD129A, an analog of p119-133 with a substitution of Ala for 129Asp, as an antagonist which can inhibit the response of two of the three T-cell clones. Then, using a yeast expression system, we prepared a mutant beta-Lg (mutD129A) with the same substitution of Ala for 129Asp as that in pD129A. This mutant protein could inhibit the proliferation of the two T-cell clones in a manner similar to the effect of pD129A. From these results we can demonstrate that TCR antagonism can be elicited by peptides naturally processed from a single-substituted mutant protein as well as by the corresponding peptides added exogenously.",

        "abstract": "Morbidity and mortality from head trauma is highest among children. No animal model mimicking traumatic brain injury in children has yet been established, and the mechanisms of neuronal degeneration after traumatic injury to the developing brain are not understood. In infant rats subjected to percussion head trauma, two types of brain damage could be characterized. The first type or primary damage evolved within 4 hr and occurred by an excitotoxic mechanism. The second type or secondary damage evolved within 6-24 hr and occurred by an apoptotic mechanism. Primary damage remained localized to the parietal cortex at the site of impact. Secondary damage affected distant sites such as the cingulate/retrosplenial cortex, subiculum, frontal cortex, thalamus and striatum. Secondary apoptotic damage was more severe than primary excitotoxic damage. Morphometric analysis demonstrated that the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonate and dizocilpine protected against primary excitotoxic damage but increased severity of secondary apoptotic damage. 2-Sulfo-alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butyl-nitrone, a free radical scavenger, did not affect primary excitotoxic damage but mitigated apoptotic damage. These observations demonstrate that apoptosis and not excitotoxicity determine neuropathologic outcome after traumatic injury to the developing brain. Whereas free radical scavengers may prove useful in therapy of head trauma in children, N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists should be avoided because of their propensity to increase severity of apoptotic damage.",

        "abstract": "In order to follow the spatial and temporal evolution of neuronal damage, cellular activation and stress responses subsequent to lithium-pilocarpine seizures of various durations in the adult rat, we analyzed the expression of Fos protein and local cerebral glucose utilization as markers of cellular activation, HSP72 immunoreactivity and acid fuchsin staining as indicators of cellular stress and injury, and Cresyl violet staining for the assessment of neuronal damage. The expression of Fos appeared very early, 2-30 min after the onset of polyspikes and intensified during the following 4 h. Fos immunoreactivity was especially high in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, amygdala and anterior olfactory nuclei. Local cerebral glucose utilization measured during the second hour of seizures was largely increased (350-580%) over control levels in cortical areas, amygdala, dentate gyrus, caudate nucleus and mediodorsal thalamus. HSP72 immunoreactivity never appeared earlier than 40-50 min after the onset of polyspikes, and was most prominent in hippocampal CA3 area, cerebral cortex (except the piriform cortex) and anterior olfactory nuclei. Acid fuchsin staining was maximal in the piriform cortex and the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus. Staining was moderate in the sensorimotor cortex and the amygdala. Neuronal damage was extensive in the piriform and entorhinal cortices, the hippocampal CA3 area and the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus, basal amygdala, mediodorsal thalamus and anterior olfactory nuclei. In conclusion, the present study shows that brain regions with the highest expression of Fos and the largest metabolic activation were also highly stained with acid fuchsin and most heavily damaged. Conversely, there is no clear relationship between HSP72 expression, cellular activation and neuronal damage.",

Each opioid receptor exhibits a distinct pharmacological profile as well as a distinct pattern of temporal and spatial expression in the brain, suggesting the critical role of transcription regulatory elements and their associated factors. Here, we report the identification of a minimum core promoter, in the 5'-flanking region of the mouse DOR gene, containing an E box and a GC box that are crucial for DOR promoter activity in NS20Y cells, a DOR-expressing mouse neuronal cell line. In vitro protein-DNA binding assays and in vivo transient transfection assays indicated that members of both the upstream stimulatory factor and Sp families of transcription factors bound to and trans-activated the DOR promoter via the E box and GC box, respectively. Furthermore, functional and physical interactions between these factors were critical for the basal as well as maximum promoter activity of the DOR gene. Thus, the distinct developmental emergence and brain regional distribution of the delta opioid receptor appear to be controlled, at least in part, by these two regulatory elements and their associated factors.",

        "abstract": "Full term pregnancy early in life is the most effective natural protection against breast cancer in women. Rats treated with chemical carcinogen are similarly protected by a previous pregnancy from mammary carcinogenesis. Proliferation and differentiation of the mammary gland does not explain this phenomenon, as shown by the relative ineffectiveness of perphenazine, a potent mitogenic and differentiating agent. Here, we show that short term treatment of nulliparous rats with pregnancy levels of estradiol 17beta and progesterone has high efficacy in protecting them from chemical carcinogen induced mammary cancers. Because the mammary gland is exposed to the highest physiological concentrations of estradiol and progesterone during full term pregnancy, it is these elevated levels of hormones that likely induce protection from mammary cancer. Thus, it appears possible to mimic the protective effects of pregnancy against breast cancer in nulliparous rats by short term specific hormonal intervention.",

        "abstract": "Conventional treatment of obesity reduces fat in mature adipocytes but leaves them with lipogenic enzymes capable of rapid resynthesis of fat, a likely factor in treatment failure. Adenovirus-induced hyperleptinemia in normal rats results in rapid nonketotic fat loss that persists after hyperleptinemia disappears, whereas pair-fed controls regain their weight in 2 weeks. We report here that the hyperleptinemia depletes adipocyte fat while profoundly down-regulating lipogenic enzymes and their transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma in epididymal fat; enzymes of fatty acid oxidation and their transcription factor, PPARalpha, normally low in adipocytes, are up-regulated, as are uncoupling proteins 1 and 2. This transformation of adipocytes from cells that store triglycerides to fatty acid-oxidizing cells is accompanied by loss of the adipocyte markers, adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein 2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and leptin, and by the appearance of the preadipocyte marker Pref-1. These findings suggest a strategy for the treatment of obesity by alteration of the adipocyte phenotype.",

        "abstract": "Conjugation of drugs with antibodies to surface endothelial antigens is a potential strategy for drug delivery to endothelium. We studied antibodies to platelet-endothelial adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1, a stably expressed endothelial antigen) as carriers for vascular immunotargeting. Although 125I-labeled anti-PECAM bound to endothelial cells in culture, the antibody was poorly internalized by the cells and accumulated poorly after intravenous administration in mice and rats. However, conjugation of biotinylated anti-PECAM (b-anti-PECAM) with streptavidin (SA) markedly stimulated uptake and internalization of anti-PECAM by endothelial cells and by cells expressing PECAM. In addition, conjugation with streptavidin markedly stimulated uptake of 125I-labeled b-anti-PECAM in perfused rat lungs and in the lungs of intact animals after either intravenous or intraarterial injection. The antioxidant enzyme catalase conjugated with b-anti-PECAM/SA bound to endothelial cells in culture, entered the cells, escaped intracellular degradation, and protected the cells against H2O2-induced injury. Anti-PECAM/SA/125I-catalase accumulated in the lungs after intravenous injection or in the perfused rat lungs and protected these lungs against H2O2-induced injury. Thus, modification of a poor carrier antibody with biotin and SA provides an approach for facilitation of antibody-mediated drug targeting. Anti-PECAM/SA is a promising candidate for vascular immunotargeting of bioactive drugs.",

        "title": "Type 2 diabetes: evidence for linkage on chromosome 20 in 716 Finnish affected sib pairs.",
        "abstract": "We are conducting a genome scan at an average resolution of 10 centimorgans (cM) for type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes in 716 affected sib pairs from 477 Finnish families. To date, our best evidence for linkage is on chromosome 20 with potentially separable peaks located on both the long and short arms. The unweighted multipoint maximum logarithm of odds score (MLS) was 3.08 on 20p (location, chi = 19.5 cM) under an additive model, whereas the weighted MLS was 2.06 on 20q (chi = 57 cM, recurrence risk,lambda(s) = 1. 25, P = 0.009). Weighted logarithm of odds scores of 2.00 (chi = 69.5 cM, P = 0.010) and 1.92 (chi = 18.5 cM, P = 0.013) were also observed. Ordered subset analyses based on sibships with extreme mean values of diabetes-related quantitative traits yielded sets of families who contributed disproportionately to the peaks. Two-hour glucose levels in offspring of diabetic individuals gave a MLS of 2. 12 (P = 0.0018) at 9.5 cM. Evidence from this and other studies suggests at least two diabetes-susceptibility genes on chromosome 20. We have also screened the gene for maturity-onset diabetes of the young 1, hepatic nuclear factor 4-a (HNF-4alpha) in 64 affected sibships with evidence for high chromosomal sharing at its location on chromosome 20q. We found no evidence that sequence changes in this gene accounted for the linkage results we observed.",

Thus, computer processing of digital images and other information helps to refine patient data presentation, analysis, interpretation, and communication. This form of data management is especially valuable in oncological research, where clinical trials demand rapid, ongoing assessment of results and analysis of large amounts of data.

        "abstract": "Stereocilia of the inner ear play an integral role in the mechanotransduction of sound. Their structural support is derived from actin filaments and actin-binding proteins. We have identified a novel actin-binding protein, 2E4-kaptin (KPTN), which appears to be involved in this structural network. Using double label immunofluorescence, we now show that KPTN extends beyond the barbed ends of actin filaments at the tips of stereocilia, and using cloned human cDNA, we mapped KPTN to chromosome 19q13.4. A combination of FISH, radiation hybrid mapping and YAC screening localized KPTN between markers D19S412 and NIB1805, making this gene an excellent functional and positional candidate for DFNA4, a form of autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss. We identified a second family with inherited deafness that also maps to the DFNA4 region. To screen KPTN for deafness-causing mutations, we first determined its genomic structure and then completed a mutational analysis by direct sequencing and SSCP in affected family members. Although no deafness-causing mutations were identified in the coding region, KPTN remains an excellent candidate gene for hearing loss; by synteny, its murine orthologue also remains a candidate gene for the Nijmegan waltzer (nv) mouse mutant, which has vestibular defects and a variable sensorineural hearing loss.",

        "abstract": "The immunodominant, CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to the HLA-B8-restricted peptide, RAKFKQLL, located in the Epstein-Barr virus immediate-early antigen, BZLF1, is characterized by a diverse T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. Here, we show that this diversity can be partitioned on the basis of crossreactive cytotoxicity patterns involving the recognition of a self peptide-RSKFRQIV-located in a serine/threonine kinase and a bacterial peptide-RRKYKQII-located in Staphylococcus aureus replication initiation protein. Thus CTL clones that recognized the viral, self, and bacterial peptides expressed a highly restricted alphabeta TCR phenotype. The CTL clones that recognized viral and self peptides were more oligoclonal, whereas clones that strictly recognized the viral peptide displayed a diverse TCR profile. Interestingly, the self and bacterial peptides equally were substantially less effective than the cognate viral peptide in sensitizing target cell lysis, and also resulted only in a weak reactivation of memory CTLs in limiting dilution assays, whereas the cognate peptide was highly immunogenic. The described crossreactions show that human antiviral, CD8(+) CTL responses can be shaped by peptide ligands derived from autoantigens and environmental bacterial antigens, thereby providing a firm structural basis for molecular mimicry involving class I-restricted CTLs in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease.",

In this brief announcement, we show that there is a perfectly satisfactory existence theory for nonatomic games provided this nonatomicity is formulated on the basis of a particular class of measure spaces, hyperfinite Loeb spaces. We also emphasize other desirable properties of games on hyperfinite Loeb spaces, and present a synthetic treatment, embracing both large games as well as those with incomplete information.",

        "abstract": "Coactivators previously implicated in ligand-dependent activation functions by thyroid hormone receptor (TR) include p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP), the steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1)-related family of proteins, and the multicomponent TR-associated protein (TRAP) complex. Here we show that two positive cofactors (PC2 and PC4) derived from the upstream stimulatory activity (USA) cofactor fraction act synergistically to mediate thyroid hormone (T3)-dependent activation either by TR or by a TR-TRAP complex in an in vitro system reconstituted with purified factors and DNA templates. Significantly, the TRAP-mediated enhancement of activation by TR does not require the TATA box-binding protein-associated factors of TFIID. Furthermore, neither the pleiotropic coactivators CBP and p300 nor members of the SRC-1 family were detected in either the TR-TRAP complex or the other components of the in vitro assay system. These results show that activation by TR at the level of naked DNA templates is enhanced by cooperative functions of the TRAP coactivators and the general coactivators PC2 and PC4, and they further indicate a potential functional redundancy between TRAPs and TATA box-binding protein-associated factors in TFIID. In conjunction with earlier studies on other nuclear receptor-interacting cofactors, the present study also suggests a multistep pathway, involving distinct sets of cofactors, for activation of hormone responsive genes.",

Many transcription factors of this class have been conserved during evolution; however, the functional significance of their structural conservation is generally not known. ap is best known for its fundamental role as a dorsal selector gene required for patterning and growth of the wing, but it also has other important functions required for neuronal fasciculation, fertility, and normal viability. We isolated mouse (mLhx2) and human (hLhx2) ap orthologs, and we used transgenic animals and rescue assays to investigate the conservation of the Ap protein during evolution. We found that the human protein LHX2 is able to regulate correctly ap target genes in the fly, causes the same phenotypes as Ap when ectopically produced, and most importantly rescues ap mutant phenotypes as efficiently as the fly protein. In addition, we found striking similarities in the expression patterns of the Drosophila and murine genes. Both mLhx2 and ap are expressed in the respective nerve cords, eyes, olfactory organs, brain, and limbs. These results demonstrate the conservation of Ap protein function across phyla and argue that aspects of its expression pattern have also been conserved from a common ancestor of insects and vertebrates.",

Several distinct clinical syndromes accompany infection with diarrheagenic E. coli categories, including traveler's diarrhea (enterotoxigenic E. coli), hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (enterohemorrhagic E. coli), persistent diarrhea (enteroaggregative E. coli), and watery diarrhea of infants (entero-pathogenic E. coli). This review discusses the current level of understanding of the pathogenesis of the diarrheagenic E. coli strains and describes how their pathogenic schemes underlie the clinical manifestations, diagnostic approach, and epidemiologic investigation of these important pathogens.",

        "abstract": "The ability to taste the bitter compound phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) and related chemicals is bimodal, and all human populations tested to date contain some people who can and some people who cannot taste PTC. Why this trait has been maintained in the population is uncertain but this polymorphism may influence food selection, nutritional status or thyroid metabolism. The gene product that gives rise to this phenotype is unknown, and its characterization would provide insight into the mechanism of bitter taste perception. Although this trait is often considered a simple Mendelian trait, i.e. one gene two alleles, a recent linkage study found a major locus on chromosome 5p15 and evidence for an additional locus on chromosome 7. The development of methods to identify these genes will provide a good stepping-stone between single-gene disorders and polygenic traits.",

        "abstract": "The competing public health concerns of vector-borne disease and vector control strategies, particularly pesticide use, are inherently subjective and difficult to balance. Disease response decisions must frequently be made in the absence of data or clear criteria. The factors to be weighed include the vector control measures versus those posed by the disease itself; short-term versus long-term disease management goals, specifically with regard to the issue of pesticide resistance; the need to distinguish among diseases of differing severity in making response choices; and the issue of pesticide efficacy. New York City's experience with West Nile virus has illustrated each of these issues. A framework for assessing the appropriate response to West Nile virus can serve to guide our response to likely new pathogens.",

        "abstract": "Mosquito control began in New York City in 1901. Large-scale efforts to drain marshlands occurred through the 1930s, and aerial application of pesticide occurred as early as 1956. Components of early mosquito-borne disease control were reimplemented in 1999-2000 in response to an outbreak of West Nile virus, and included promoting public and health professional awareness regarding disease causation and prevention, providing free government laboratory testing, case reporting, mapping of mosquito breeding sites and their elimination or application of larvicide to them, and adult mosquito control. Because a potential for various mosquito-borne diseases in New York City persists, continued efforts are warranted to limit mosquito breeding, to monitor adult mosquito populations for the presence of human pathogens, and to establish protocols and capacity for adult mosquito control.",

        "title": "Community participation in a multisectoral intervention to address health determinants in an inner-city community in central Havana.",
        "abstract": "It is increasingly acknowledged that the process of community involvement is critical to the successful implementation of community-based health interventions. Between 1995 and 1999, a multisectoral intervention called Plan Cayo Hueso was launched in the inner-city community of Cayo Hueso in Havana, Cuba, to address a variety of health determinants. To provide a better understanding of the political structures and processes involved, the Cuban context is described briefly. The interventions included improvements in housing, municipal infrastructure, and social and cultural activities. A qualitative study, consisting of interviews of key informants as well as community members, was conducted to evaluate the community participatory process. Questions from an extensive household survey pre- and postintervention that had been conducted in Cayo Hueso and a comparison community to assess the effectiveness of the intervention also informed the analysis of community participation, as did three community workshops held to choose indicators for evaluating effectiveness and to discuss findings. It was found that formal leaders led the interventions, providing the institutional driving force behind the plan. However, extensive community involvement occurred as the project took advantage of the existing community-based organizations, which played an active role in mobilizing community members and enhanced linkage systems critical to the project's success. Women played fairly traditional roles in interventions outside their households, but had equivalent roles to men in interventions within their household units. Most impressive about this project was the extent of mobilization to participate and the multidimensional ecosystem approach adopted. Indeed, Plan Cayo Hueso involved a massive mobilization of international, national, and community resources to address the needs of this community. This, as well as the involvement of community residents in the evaluation process, was seen as resulting in improved social interactions and community well-being and enhanced capacity for future action. While Cuba is unique in many respects, the lessons learned about enhancing community participation in urban health intervention projects, as well as in their evaluation, are applicable worldwide.",
