Tamoxifen is an antiestrogen widely used for the treatment of breast cancer.
Current evolutions in preventive strategies to include healthy premenopausal women warrant the study of its developmental toxicity.
Perinatal treatment of male rodents with tamoxifen caused reproductive tract lesions and sexual behavior deficits similar to those induced by diethylstilbestrol (DES).
Those abnormalities could originate, at least in part, from lesions of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.
The initial alterations caused by tamoxifen in the hypothalamic medial preoptic area (MPOA) and sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA) were studied in 6-day-old male rat pups treated with 100 micrograms tamoxifen (group 1), 1 microgram DES (group 2) or vehicle (group 3) from PN1 to 5.
In situ hybridization was performed to analyze the expression of the GAP-43 gene, a marker of neuronal differentiation, and morphometry was used to study the neuronal density in the SDN-POA and MPOA and the volume and number of neurons in the SDN-POA.
Tamoxifen reduced severely the volume and neuron numbers in the SDN-POA (46.1% and 47.8% of controls, respectively).
The neuronal density of the MPOA was not modified.
GAP-43 gene expression was decreased as demonstrated by a greater percentage of unlabeled neurons (grade 0) mirrored by a lesser percentage of intensely labeled ones (grade 2) in the SDN-POA and MPOA.
In contrast to the effects of the antiestrogen, DES did not affect the above endpoints.
These data indicated that developmental exposure of male rat pups to tamoxifen-induced immediate neuronal loss in one and altered differentiation in two hypothalamic areas crucial to reproduction.
How those initial alterations contribute to the pathogenesis of the reproductive disorders observed in the adult male needs further investigation.
