In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, excessive irons as well as lactoferrin (Lf), but not transferrin (Tf), have been found in and around the affected regions of the brain.
These evidences suggest that lactoferrin plays a critical role during neurodegenerative diseases, although Lf-mediated iron transport across blood-brain barrier (BBB) is negligible compared to that of transferrin in normal condition.
However, the kinetics of lactoferrins and lactoferrin-mediated iron transport are still unknown.
To determine the kinetic rate constants of lactoferrin-mediated iron transport through BBB, a mass-action based ordinary differential equation model has been presented.
A Bayesian framework is developed to estimate the kinetic rate parameters from posterior probability density functions.
The iron transport across BBB is studied by considering both Lf- and Tf-mediated pathways for both normal and pathologic conditions.
Using the point estimates of kinetic parameters, our model can effectively reproduce the experimental data of iron transport through BBB endothelial cells.
The robustness of the model and parameter estimation process are further verified by perturbation of kinetic parameters.
Our results show that surge in high-affinity receptor density increases lactoferrin as well as iron in the brain.
Due to the lack of a feedback loop such as iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) for lactoferrin, iron can transport to the brain continuously, which might increase brain iron to pathological levels and can contribute to neurodegeneration.
This study provides an improved understanding of presence of lactoferrin and iron in the brain during neurodegenerative diseases.
