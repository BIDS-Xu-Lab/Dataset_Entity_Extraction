Primary metabolites are molecules of essential biochemical reactions that define the biological phenotype.
All primary metabolites cannot be measured in a single analysis.
In this protocol, we outline the multiplexed and quantitative measurement of 106 metabolites that cover the central part of primary metabolism.
The protocol includes several sample preparation techniques and one liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method.
Then, we describe the steps of the bioinformatic data analysis to better understand the metabolic perturbations that may occur in a biological system.
For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to: Costanza et al.,1 Blomme et al.,2 Blomme et al.,3 Guillon et al.,4 Stuani et al.5.
