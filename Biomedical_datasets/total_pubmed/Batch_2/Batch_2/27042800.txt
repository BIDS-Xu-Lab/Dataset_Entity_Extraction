The contemporary treatment of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is an area of debate.
We report outcomes of a minimally invasive approach involving transoral laser microsurgery (TLM).
A consecutive series of patients (n = 153) undergoing primary TLM for oropharyngeal SCC from 2006 to 2013 was studied.
Human papillomavirus (HPV) status was determined by p16 immunohistochemistry and high-risk HPV DNA in situ hybridization.
Survival analyses were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier statistics.
Tumor subsites included tonsil (n = 94; 61.5%), tongue base (n = 38; 24.8%), and soft palate (n = 21; 13.7%), with the majority being American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage III/IVa (n = 124; 81.0%) and HPV-positive (n = 101; 66.0%).
Three-year overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were 84.5%, 91.7%, and 78.2%, respectively.
One-year gastrostomy tube (G-tube) dependency was 1.3%.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest single-center TLM oropharyngeal SCC series to date.
Our data suggest that TLM +/- postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) results in at least as good oncologic outcomes as chemoradiotherapy (CRT), while conferring swallowing function advantages.
