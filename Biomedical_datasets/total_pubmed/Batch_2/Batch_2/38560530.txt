One-carbon metabolism is a complex network of metabolic reactions that are essential for cellular function including DNA synthesis.
Vitamin B12 and folate are micronutrients that are utilized in this pathway and their deficiency can result in the perturbation of one-carbon metabolism and subsequent perturbations in DNA replication and repair.
This effect has been well characterized in nuclear DNA but to date, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has not been investigated extensively.
Mitochondrial variants have been associated with several inherited and age-related disease states; therefore, the study of factors that impact heteroplasmy are important for advancing our understanding of the mitochondrial genome's impact on human health.
Heteroplasmy studies require robust and efficient mitochondrial DNA enrichment to carry out in-depth mtDNA sequencing.
Many of the current methods for mtDNA enrichment can introduce biases and false-positive results.
Here, we use a method that overcomes these limitations and have applied it to assess mitochondrial heteroplasmy in mouse models of altered one-carbon metabolism.
Vitamin B12 deficiency was found to cause increased levels of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy across all tissues that were investigated.
Folic acid supplementation also contributed to elevated mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy across all mouse tissues investigated.
Heteroplasmy analysis of human data from the Framingham Heart Study suggested a potential sex-specific effect of folate and vitamin B12 status on mitochondrial heteroplasmy.
This is a novel relationship that may have broader consequences for our understanding of one-carbon metabolism, mitochondrial-related disease and the influence of nutrients on DNA mutation rates.
