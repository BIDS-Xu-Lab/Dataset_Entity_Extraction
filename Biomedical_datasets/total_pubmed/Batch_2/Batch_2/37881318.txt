Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified over 100 loci associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, the functionally affected genes and the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to these associations are often unknown.
In this study, we conducted an integrative genomic analysis incorporating multiple "omics" data and identified a functional regulatory DNA variant, rs56199421, and a plausible mechanism by which it regulates the expression of a putative RA risk gene,
