Physiotherapists show a positive attitude towards playing games in order to be a role model for pediatric patients and to increase the success of therapy.
The aim of the present study is to investigate the physical playfulness of physiotherapy students and the relationship of physical playfulness and individual and environmental factors.
The sociodemographic data, regular physical activity habits of the students were examined as well as their computer game playing status and duration.
"Attitudes of 18-22 Age Adults for Playing Games That Contain Physical Activity" scale was used for assessing playfulness.
A total of 268 students participated in the study.
Among the game proneness scale subsections, the highest score was obtained in the Social Adjustment while the lowest scores were obtained in the "Desire to Play Game" and "To take pleasure from playing game" subsections.
Male students scored higher in "Risk Taking and "To take pleasure from playing game" in comparison with the female students.
There was a statistically significant difference between physical activity habits and "Game Compassion", "Risk Taking", "Social Adjustment" and "To take pleasure from playing game scores".
Physiotherapy students were found to be more playful, particularly in terms of social adaptation.
Men take more risks in the plays and also play the games more enjoyable.
Students with regular physical activity habits were more playful overall.
The present study suggests that monitoring physical activity levels, computer games types might be beneficial for evaluating the playfulness.
