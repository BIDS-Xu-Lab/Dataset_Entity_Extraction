The aim of the present study was to explore the significance of the mealtime experience among residents of nursing homes in Spain.
A qualitative phenomenological approach was followed.
An initial purposeful sampling of Spanish residents in for-profit nursing homes in the southern area of Madrid was carried out.
A theoretical sampling was also implemented in order to gain a more in-depth understanding of dependence.
Inclusion criteria for nursing home residents were: age (60 years or older) and lack of any cognitive impairment.
Data were collected using unstructured and semistructured interviews.
Data collection was concluded once theoretical saturation was reached, and the data were analysed using the Giorgi proposal.
A total of 26 residents with a mean age of 83 years were included.
Three main themes that describe the significance of meals in nursing homes emerged from the data: (i) timing of the meals - mealtimes serve as a point of reference for organizing activities in the nursing home and orient the residents during the day; (ii) table allocation - table allocation depends on the judgment of the personnel, the behavior of each resident and on the input from the residents that use a table; and (iii) the meals themselves - food is experienced as a privilege, as a sign of autonomy and normality, and as an indicator of personal identity.
Understanding the social significance of meals for residents in nursing homes would provide deeper insight into resident expectations.
This will in turn help to improve service and quality of life for residents.
