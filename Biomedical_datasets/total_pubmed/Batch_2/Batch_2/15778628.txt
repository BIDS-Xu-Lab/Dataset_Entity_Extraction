This study examined contextual factors associated with physical activity of urban African American preschoolers (N = 59).
Qualitative research methodologies utilized data from home visits, caregiver and child interviews, field notes, and document collection.
The primary finding suggested, "In underserved communities fundamental barriers exist that obstruct young children's ability to be physically active."
Four themes were developed revealing that outside environments limited opportunities for physical activity, home environments resulted in sedentary behaviors, and communities had limited physical activity role models.
Despite this, young children enjoyed being physically active.
