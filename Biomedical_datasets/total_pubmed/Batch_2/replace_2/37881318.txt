Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified over 100 loci associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, the functionally affected genes and the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to these associations are often unknown.
In this study, we conducted an integrative genomic analysis incorporating multiple "omics" data and identified a functional regulatory DNA variant, rs56199421, and a plausible mechanism by which it regulates the expression of a putative RA risk gene, ORMDL Sphingolipid Biosynthesis Regulator 3 (ORMDL3).
The T allele of rs56199421, located in the enhancer region of ORMDL3, exhibited stronger direct binding ability than the other C allele of rs56199421 did in vitro with the transcription factor JunD and demonstrated higher transcriptional activity.
Moreover, the T allele of rs56199421 is associated with elevated RA risk, and ORMDL3 expression is increased in RA patients.
Thus, these findings suggest that the T allele of rs56199421 enhances JunD transcription factor binding, increases enhancer activity, and elevates the expression of the RA risk gene ORMDL3.
