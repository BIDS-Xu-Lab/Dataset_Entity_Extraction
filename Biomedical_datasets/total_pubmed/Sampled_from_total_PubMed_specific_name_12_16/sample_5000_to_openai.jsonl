Forward data telemetry carries stimulation parameters by on-off-keying the power carrier at a data rate of 50 kb/s to selectively activate a 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0\u03bcLED array. Load-shift-keying back telemetry controls the wireless power transmission by reporting the FF-WIOS received power level in a closed-loop power control mechanism. LEDs typically require high instantaneous power to emit sufficient light for optical stimulation. Thus, a switched-capacitor-based stimulation architecture is used as an energy storage buffer with one off-chip capacitor to receive charge directly from the inductive link and deliver it to the selected \u03bcLED at the onset of stimulation. The FF-WIOS system-on-a-chip prototype, fabricated in a 0.35-\u03bcm standard CMOS process, charges a 10-\u03bcF capacitor up to 5 V with 37% efficiency and passes instantaneous current spikes up to 10 mA in the selected \u03bcLED, creating a bright exponentially decaying flash with minimal wasted power.

Examination of the mechanism by which TFAM might influence CpG ODN mediated innate immune responses revealed that TFAM binds directly, tightly and selectively to the structurally related CpG-A, -B, and -C ODN. TFAM also modulated the ability of the CpG-B or -C to stimulate the production of antibodies from human B cells. TFAM showed a dose-dependent modulation of CpG-B, and -C -induced antibody production from human B cells in vitro, with enhancement of high dose and inhibition of low doses of CpG stimulation. This effect was linked to the ability of TFAM to directly inhibit the binding of CpG ODNs to B cells, in a manner consistent with the relative binding affinities of TFAM for the ODNs. These data suggest that TFAM alters the free concentration of the CpG available to stimulate B cells by sequestering this ODN in a TFAM-CpG complex. Thus, TFAM has the potential to decrease the pathogenic consequences of exposure to natural CpG-like hypomethylated DNA in vivo, as well as such as that found in traumatic injury, infection, autoimmune disease and during pregnancy."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

Each experiment included five groups: no irradiation and irradiation (+/-Adcontrol, AdEF1alpha-hKGF, or AdLTR(2)EF1alpha-hKGF). Blood, saliva, submandibular glands, and tongue were collected on day 7 for single-dose studies or day 10 for fractionated dosing. hKGF levels were measured by ELISA. In three separate single-dose irradiation experiments, lingual ulcers were dramatically reduced after either KGF-expressing vector. Similarly, in two separate fractionated irradiation experiments, the hKGF-expressing vectors completely prevented ulcer formation. QPCR data indicated that approximately 10(7) to 10(8) particles of each vector remained in the targeted submandibular glands at the terminal time. Transgenic hKGF protein was found at high levels in saliva, serum, and submandibular gland extracts. hKGF gene transfer to salivary glands prevented radiation-induced oral mucositis in mice.

Here, we propose a machine learning approach to predict the REE contents based on the bulk composition of coal ashes, easily measurable under the routine testing protocol. We introduce a multi-task neural network that simultaneously predicts the contents of different REEs. Compared to the single-task model, this model exhibits notably improved accuracy and reduced sensitivity to noise. Further model analyses reveal key data patterns for screening coal ashes with high REE concentrations.

CONDITION AND TARGET POPULATION  REFRACTIVE ERRORS: Refractive errors occur when the eye cannot focus light properly. In myopia (near- or short-sightedness), distant objects appear blurry because the axis of the eye is too long or the cornea is too steep, so light becomes focused in front of the retina. Hyperopia (far sightedness) occurs when light is focused behind the retina causing nearby objects to appear blurry. In astigmatism, blurred or distorted vision occurs when light is focused at two points rather than one due to an irregularly shaped cornea or lens. Refractive errors are common worldwide, but high refractive errors are less common. [CI], 6.5% - 8.3%), 7.8% (95% CI, 6.4% - 8.6%), and 3.1% (95% CI, 2.2% - 3.9%), respectively. The prevalence of high hyperopia (\u2265 3 D) is 1.0% (95% CI, .6% - 1.4%), 2.4% (95% CI, 1.7% - 3.0%), and 10.0% (95% CI, 9.1% - 10.9%) for the same age groupings. Finally, the prevalence of astigmatism (\u2265 1 D cylinder) is 23.1% (95% CI, 21.6% - 24.5%), 27.6% (95% CI, 25.8% - 29.3%) and 50.1% (48.2% - 52.0%). According to the Ontario Schedule of Benefits, low visual acuity is defined by a best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) of 20/50 (6/15) or less in the better eye and not amenable to further medical and/or surgical treatment. Similarly, the Ontario Assistive Devices Program defines low vision as BSCVA in the better eye in the range of 20/70 or less that cannot be corrected medically, surgically, or with ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses. Estimates of the prevalence of low vision vary. Using the criteria of BSCVA ranging from 20/70 to 20/160, one study estimated that 35.6 per 10,000 people in Canada have low vision. The 2001 Participation and Activity Limitation Survey (PALS) found that 594,350 (2.5%) Canadians had \"difficulty seeing ordinary newsprint or clearly seeing the face of someone from 4 m,\" and the Canadian National Institute for the Blind (CNIB) registry classified 105,000 (.35%) Canadians as visually disabled. A phakic intraocular lens (pIOL) is a supplementary lens that is inserted into the anterior or posterior chamber of the eye to correct refractive errors (myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism). Unlike in cataract surgery, the eye's natural crystalline lens is not removed when the pIOL is inserted, so the eye retains its accommodative ability. In Canada and the United States, iris-fixated (anterior chamber lenses that are anchored to the iris with a claw) and posterior chamber lenses are the only types of pIOLs that are licensed by Health Canada and the Food and Drug Administration, respectively. EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS METHOD:  RESEARCH QUESTIONS #ENTITYSTARTX00026; What are the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and safety of pIOLs for the treatment of myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism?Do certain subgroups (e.g. high myopia and low vision) benefit more from pIOLs?How do pIOLs compare with alternative surgical treatment options (LASIK, PRK, and CLE)?Using appropriate keywords, a literature search was conducted up to January 2009. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies with more than 20 eyes receiving pIOLs were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcomes of interest were uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), predictability of manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE), and adverse events. The GRADE approach was used to systematically and explicitly evaluate the quality of evidence. The search identified 1,131 citations published between January 1, 2003, and January 16, 2009. Including a health technology assessment (HTA) identified in the bibliography review, 30 studies met the inclusion criteria: two HTAs; one systematic review; 20 pre-post observational studies; and seven comparative studies (five pIOL vs. LASIK, one pIOL vs. PRK, and one pIOL vs. CLE). Both HTAs concluded that there was good evidence of the short-term efficacy and safety of pIOLs, however, their conclusions regarding long-term safety differed. The 2006 HTA found convincing evidence of long-term safety, while the 2009 HTA found no long-term evidence about the risks of complications including cataract development, corneal damage, and retinal detachment. The systematic review of adverse events found that cataract development (incidence rate of 9.6% of eyes) is a substantial risk following posterior chamber pIOL implantation, while chronic endothelial cell loss is a safety concern after iris-fixated pIOL implantation. Adverse event rates varied by lens type, but they were more common in eyes that received posterior chamber pIOLs. The evidence of pIOL effectiveness is based on pre-post case series. These studies reported a variety of outcomes and different follow-up time points. It was difficult to combine the data into meaningful summary measures as many time points are based on a single study with a very small sample size. Overall, the efficacy evidence is low to very low quality based on the GRADE Working Group Criteria. For all refractive errors (low to high), most eyes experienced a substantial increase in uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) with more than 75% of eyes achieving UCVA of 20/40 or better at all postoperative time points. The proportion of eyes that achieved postoperative UCVA 20/20 or better varied substantially according type of lens used and the type of refractive error being corrected, ranging from about 30% of eyes that received iris-fixated lenses for myopia to more than 78% of eyes that received posterior chamber toric lenses for myopic astigmatism. Predictability of manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) within \u00b1 2.0 D was very high (\u2265 90%) for all types of lenses and refractive error. At most time points, more than 50% of eyes achieved a MRSE within \u00b1 0.5 D of emmetropia and at least 85% within \u00b1 1.0 D. Predictability was lower for eyes with more severe preoperative refractive errors. The mean postoperative MRSE was less than 1.0 D in all but two studies. Safety, defined as a loss of two or more Snellen lines of best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), was high for all refractive errors and lens types. Losses of two or more lines of BSCVA were uncommon, occurring in fewer than 2% of eyes that had received posterior chamber pIOLs for myopia, and less than 1% of eyes that received iris-fixated lens implantation for myopia. Most eyes did not experience a clinically significant change in BSCVA (i.e. loss of one line, no change, or gain of one line), but 10% to 20% of eyes gained two or more lines of BSCVA. The pIOL outcomes for UCVA, predictability, BSCVA, and adverse events were compared with FDA targets and safety values for refractive surgery and found to meet or exceed these targets at most follow-up time points. The results were then stratified to examine the efficacy of pIOLs for high refractive errors. There was limited data for many outcomes and time points, but overall the results were similar to those for all levels of refractive error severity. The studies that compared pIOLs with LASIK, PRK, and CLE for patients with moderate to high myopia and myopic astigmatism showed that pIOLs performed better than these alternative surgical options for the outcomes of: UCVA,predictability and stability of MRSE,postoperative MRSE,safety (measured as clinically significant loss of BSCVA), andgains in BSCVA.Correction of refractive cylinder (astigmatism) was the only outcome that favoured refractive surgery over pIOLs. This was observed for both toric and non-toric pIOLs (toric pIOLs correct for astigmatism, non-toric pIOLs do not). Common adverse events in the LASIK groups were diffuse lamellar keratitis and striae in the corneal flap. In the pIOL groups, lens repositioning and lens opacities (both asymptomatic and visually significant cataracts) were the most commonly observed adverse events. These studies were determined to be of low to very low evidence quality based on the GRADE Working Group Criteria.

The safety profile of SGLT2 inhibitors is well defined, and the adverse event profile is largely consistent with their mechanism of action. These well-recognized events include genital mycotic infections and volume-associated adverse events. Serious safety issues detected more recently with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, such as bone fractures, pyelonephritis, urosepsis, and ketoacidosis, have been uncommon. A robust improvement in cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was recently demonstrated with empagliflozin. Given the glucose-lowering efficacy, low risk of hypoglycemia, and other benefits associated with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, this class of oral glucose-lowering medication is a valuable addition to treatment options for T2DM, and may play an increasingly prominent therapeutic role as emerging data are revealed."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

The physiological activities of UCPs have been hotly contested, and the involvement of UCPs in the pathogenesis and progression of diabetes mellitus is among the greatest concerns. UCPs are hypothesised to be triggered by superoxide and then reduce mitochondrial free radical production, potentially protecting diabetes mellitus patients who are experiencing oxidative stress. The objectives of the study are to find out the newest ways to treat diabetes mellitus through protein uncoupling. Research and review papers are collected from different databases like google scholar, PubMed, Mendeley, Scopus, Science Open, Directory of open access journals, and Education Resources Information Center, using different keywords such as \"uncoupling proteins in diabetes mellitus treatment\", \"UCP 1\", \"UCP 2\", and 'UCP 3\". UCP1, UCP2, and UCP 3 are the potential targets as an uncoupling protein for the treatment of diabetes mellitus for new drugs. New drugs treat the disease by reducing oxidative stress through thermogenesis and energy expenditure. UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 have a role in fatty acid metabolism, negative control of insulin production, and insulin sensitivity by beta-cells. Polymorphisms in the UCP 1, 2, and 3 genes significantly reduce the risk of developing diabetes mellitus. Protein uncoupling indirectly targets the GPCR and islet of Langerhans. This review summarises the advances in understanding the role of UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 in diabetes mellitus."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

A total of 59 fecal samples from healthy wild newborn and juvenile vicu\u00f1as, raised in captivity in Jujuy, Argentina were collected and analyzed by ELISA to detect RVA antigen. Two samples (3%) were found to contain G8 RVA strains and one strain (RVA/Vicu\u00f1a-wt/ARG/C75/2010/G8P[14]) was selected for further genome analyses, revealing the G8-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-Ax-N2-T6-E3-Hx genotype constellation. Unfortunately, no sequence data could be obtained for NSP1 and NSP5. Except for the E3 NSP4 genotype, this partial genotype constellation is reminiscent to bovine RVA strains and bovine-like RVA strains isolated from sheep, guanaco, antelope and humans. This relationship was confirmed phylogenetically, providing further evidence of the widespread presence of this genotype constellation in animals belonging to the artiodactyls. In particular, a close phylogenetic relationship was found between C75 and guanaco RVA strain RVA/Guanaco-wt/ARG/Chubut/1999/G8P[14] for at least 5 gene segments, suggesting a partial conservation of the genotype constellation of RVA strains infecting different species of SACs, even though nowadays their natural habitats are not overlapping.

In addition, the posterior oropharyngeal/tonsillar swab, which is commonly used to sample oropharyngeal Neisseria, is poorly tolerated by many individuals. We evaluated an alternative non-invasive method to isolate oropharyngeal commensal Neisseria and to detect decreased susceptibility to azithromycin using selective media (LBVT.SNR) with and without azithromycin (2 \u00b5g/mL). In this pilot study, we compared paired posterior oropharyngeal/tonsillar swabs and oral rinse-and-gargle samples from 10 participants and demonstrated that a similar Neisseria species diversity and number of colonies were isolated from both sample types. Moreover, the proportion of Neisseria colonies that had a decreased susceptibility to azithromycin was similar in the rinse samples compared to the swabs. This pilot study has produced encouraging data that a simple protocol of oral rinse-and-gargle and culture on plates selective for commensal Neisseria with and without a target antimicrobial can be used as a surveillance tool to monitor antimicrobial susceptibility in commensal oropharyngeal Neisseria.

To date, little is known on the trends in the use of ION for scoliosis surgery in the United States. A retrospective review was performed using the PearlDiver Database to identify patients that had scoliosis surgery with and without ION from years 2005 to 2011. Demographic information (such as age, gender, region within the United States) and clinical information (such as type of ION and rates of neurological injury) were assessed. There were 3618 patients who had scoliosis surgery during the study period. ION was used in 1361 (37.6%) of these cases. The number of cases in which ION was used increased from 27% in 2005 to 46.9% in 2011 (p < 0.0001). Multimodal ION was used more commonly than unimodal ION (64.6% vs. 35.4%). The most commonly used modality was combined SSEP and EMG while the least used modality was MEP only. Neurological injuries occurred in 1.8% and 2.0% of patients that had surgery with and without ION, respectively (p = 0.561). ION was used most commonly in patients < 65 years of age and in the Northeastern part of the United States (age; p = 0.006, region; p < 0.0001). The use of ION for scoliosis surgery gradually increased annually from 2005 to 2011. Age and regional differences were noted with neuromonitoring being most commonly used for scoliosis surgery in non-elderly patients and in the Northeastern part of the United States. No differences were noted in the risk of neurological injury in patients that had surgery with and without ION. Although the findings from this study may seem to suggest that ION may not influence the risk of neurologic injury, this result must be interpreted with caution as inherently riskier surgeries may utilize ION more, leading to an actual reduction in injuries more dramatic than observed in this study."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

Bacteria have been popular subjects of interactome studies: more than six different bacterial species have been the subjects of comprehensive interactome studies while several more have had substantial segments of their proteomes screened for interactions. The protein interactomes of several bacterial species have been completed, including several from prominent human pathogens. The availability of interactome data has brought challenges, as these large data sets are difficult to compare across species, limiting their usefulness for broad studies of microbial genetics and evolution. In this study, we use more than 52,000 unique protein-protein interactions (PPIs) across 349 different bacterial species and strains to determine their conservation across data sets and taxonomic groups. When proteins are collapsed into orthologous groups (OGs) the resulting meta-interactome still includes more than 43,000 interactions, about 14,000 of which involve proteins of unknown function. While conserved interactions provide support for protein function in their respective species data, we found only 429 PPIs (~1% of the available data) conserved in two or more species, rendering any cross-species interactome comparison immediately useful. The meta-interactome serves as a model for predicting interactions, protein functions, and even full interactome sizes for species with limited to no experimentally observed PPI, including Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella enterica which are predicted to have up to 18,000 and 31,000 PPIs, respectively. In the course of this work, we have assembled cross-species interactome comparisons that will allow interactomics researchers to anticipate the structures of yet-unexplored microbial interactomes and to focus on well-conserved yet uncharacterized interactors for further study. Such conserved interactions should provide evidence for important but yet-uncharacterized aspects of bacterial physiology and may provide targets for anti-microbial therapies."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

Significant increasing trends were observed for kidney, thyroid and uterine cancers. Overall incidence has increased among both sexes younger than 50 years of age, with recent increases in pancreatic cancer among men, breast cancer among women and colorectal cancer among both sexes. From the birth cohort analysis, we observed increasing trends in colorectal, liver and prostate cancers among men; kidney cancer and melanoma among women; and thyroid cancer among both sexes.

However, most randomized trials have failed to show survival benefits. Examining nonlinear associations between antioxidant levels and health outcomes may help to explain these discrepant findings. We evaluated all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular mortality risks associated with quintiles (Q1-Q5) of serum antioxidant (vitamins C and E, \u03b2-carotene, and selenium) and vitamin A levels, in 16,008 adult participants of The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III; 1988-1994). Over a median follow-up period of 14.2 years, there were 4,225 deaths, including 891 from cancer and 1,891 from cardiovascular disease. We observed a dose-response decrease in cancer and overall mortality risks with higher vitamin C levels. In contrast, for vitamin A, risk of cancer death decreased from Q1-Q2, with no further decline in risk at higher levels. For vitamin E, having levels in Q4 was associated with the lowest cancer mortality risk. Both vitamin A and E had U-shaped associations with all-cause mortality. Cancer mortality risks decreased from Q1-Q2 for \u03b2-carotene and from Q1-Q4 for selenium. However, for \u03b2-carotene and selenium, overall mortality risks decreased from Q1-Q2 but then did not change significantly with higher levels. Antioxidant supplement use should be studied in the context of overall mortality and other competing mortality risks. These data suggest the need for novel intervention studies where doses of these agents are individualized based on their serum levels, and possibly, markers of oxidative stress and systemic inflammatory response."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

Overall, only 6% of the subjects who visited the nutritional clinic had the maximum adherence to the Mediterranean diet, 73% had an average adherence, followed by 21% with low adherence. Multivariable analysis between risk factors and socio-demographic characteristics and the adherence to Mediterranean diet revealed that male gender relates directly (p =0.002, AOR = 2.95) to a low adherence. There are three criteria in the questionnaire for a point in favour of Mediterranean diet which we believe to be inadequate, as they are not in accordance with the Italian guidelines for healthy eating.

All the papers published in three electronic databases, namely Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science, were searched for the purposes of this study. The searching process started on 15 October and lasted until 9 November 2020. Eventually, 10 reports were found about the clinical outcomes of SFT for the management of the OTCS. The included studies were carried out on a total of 234 patients with OTCS, all of whom had undergone SFT. Evaluation of urologic symptoms revealed that 40-100% of patients with OTCS suffered from urinary instability. Moreover, its improvement rate after SFT was estimated at 59-100%. Evaluation of neurological symptoms indicated that 25-69% of patients with OTCS suffered from back/leg pain, And its improvement rate, the symptoms of back/leg pain of all patients were resolved or improved after SFT. Lower extremity weakness was found in 9-40% of patients with OTCS which was resolved or improved after SFT in about 25-100% of patients. Nevertheless, surgical indications for occult tight filum terminale syndrome remain controversial. Although it seems that the SFT in OTCS patients is promising in treating neurologic, orthopedic and urological symptoms, usage of surgical untethering for patients with OTCS is a controversial issue.

The following were measured; the angle of the pedicle relative to the sagital plane, the smallest internal and external diameter of the pedicles and the angle of the lamina. Angular measures had a CV% of 3.9%. The re-measurement error for distance was 0.5 mm. Three hundred and thirty-six pedicles were assessed in 25 females and 29 males. Average age was 48.2 years (range 17-85). Our morphologic data from live subjects was comparable to previous cadaveric data. Mean pedicle external diameter was 4.9 mm at C3 and 6.6 mm at C7. Females were marginally smaller than males. Left and right did not significantly differ. In no case was the pedicle narrower than 3.2 mm. Mean pedicle angle was 130 degrees at C3 and 140 degrees at C7.

In a randomized, controlled trial 98 atopic, pregnant women received fish oil (3.7 g n-3 PUFAs per day) or placebo from 20 weeks' gestation until delivery. Neonatal PUFA levels and immunologic response to allergens were measured at birth. Fish oil supplementation (n = 40) achieved significantly higher proportions of n-3 PUFAs in neonatal erythrocyte membranes (mean +/- SD, 17.75% +/- 1.85% as a percentage of total fatty acids) compared with the control group (n = 43, 13.69% +/- 1.22%, P <.001). All neonatal cytokine (IL-5, IL-13, IL-10, and IFN-gamma) responses (to all allergens) tended to be lower in the fish oil group (statistically significant only for IL-10 in response to cat). Although this study was not designed to examine clinical effects, we noted that infants in the fish oil group were 3 times less likely to have a positive skin prick test to egg at 1 year of age (odds ratio, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.11 to 1.02; P =.055).

There has been increasing interest in GABA signaling and modulation as it pertains to the development of altered circuity and depressive states. This scientific underpinning served as the rationale for the initial development of brexanolone. We review the clinical trials supporting its Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval as the first rapidly acting antidepressant specific for PPD, and the subsequent development of a clinical brexanolone program at an academic medical center, highlighting new research and data from that site as well as the challenges with the delivery of this I.V. drug. In addition to the GABA signaling hypothesis, we discuss the new evidence demonstrating that brexanolone inhibits inflammatory signaling post-infusion, suggesting that inflammatory signaling may contribute to the etiology of PPD. Finally, we describe new and future directions in neurosteroid therapeutics, including the development of an oral agent, zuranolone, and the IV and oral formulations of ganaxolone.

Its thallus is filamentous, initially organized as a main primary filament composed of elongated cells and round cells, from which branches differentiate. Modeling of its early development suggests the involvement of very local positional information mediated by cell-cell recognition. However, this model also indicates that an additional mechanism is required to ensure proper organization of the branching pattern. In this paper, we show that auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is detectable in mature E. siliculosus organisms and that it is present mainly at the apices of the filaments in the early stages of development. An in silico survey of auxin biosynthesis, conjugation, response, and transport genes showed that mainly IAA biosynthesis genes from land plants have homologs in the E. siliculosus genome. In addition, application of exogenous auxins and 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid had different effects depending on the developmental stage of the organism, and we propose a model in which auxin is involved in the negative control of progression in the developmental program. Furthermore, we identified an auxin-inducible gene called EsGRP1 from a small-scale microarray experiment and showed that its expression in a series of morphogenetic mutants was positively correlated with both their elongated-to-round cell ratio and their progression in the developmental program. Altogether, these data suggest that IAA is used by the brown alga Ectocarpus to relay cell-cell positional information and induces a signaling pathway different from that known in land plants."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

The extracellular N-terminal domains (NTDs) of iGluR subunits show sequence homology to the bacterial periplasmic leucine/isoleucine/valine binding protein (LIVBP) and have been implicated in iGluR assembly, trafficking, and function. Here, we investigated how deletion of the NR1- and NR2-NTDs affects the expression and function of NMDA receptors. Both proteolytic cleavage of the NR1-NTD from assembled NR1/NR2 receptors and coexpression of the NTD-deleted NR1 subunit with wild-type or NTD-deleted NR2 subunits resulted in agonist-gated channels that closely resembled wild-type receptors. This indicates that the NTDs of both NMDA receptor subunits are not essential for receptor assembly and function. However, deletion of either the NR1 or the NR2 NTD eliminated high-affinity, allosteric inhibition of agonist-induced currents by Zn2+ and ifenprodil, consistent with the idea that interdomain interactions between these domains are important for allosteric receptor modulation. Furthermore, by replacing the NR2A-NTD with the NR2B NTD, and vice versa, the different glycine affinities of NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2B receptors were found to be determined by their respective NR2-NTDs. Together, these data show that the NTDs of both the NR1 and NR2 subunits determine allosteric inhibition and glycine potency but are not required for NMDA receptor assembly."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

Since the sites for tyrosine phosphorylation and nitration are on adjacent carbon atoms, the present study tested the hypothesis that in vitro dephosphorylation of the NR1, NR2A and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor increases receptor nitration by peroxynitrite in cortical membranes of newborn piglets. To test this hypothesis, cerebral cortical P(2) membranes were prepared from normoxic and hypoxic newborn piglets and divided into dephosphorylated and non-dephosphorylated control groups. Dephosphorylation was performed in vitro by incubation with protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B and confirmed by immunoprecipitation with antiphosphotyrosine antibody. Dephosphorylated and non-dephosphorylated samples were nitrated with 0.5 mM peroxynitrite. Nitration was measured by immunoprecipitating with agarose-conjugated anti-nitrotyrosine antibody followed by Western blot analysis using specific anti -NR1, -NR2A and -NR2B primary antibodies. The data demonstrate that nitration of the NR1, NR2A and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor increases following dephosphorylation in both normoxic and hypoxic animals, however increase is much higher in hypoxic animals. We conclude that dephosphorylation at the site adjacent to the nitration site (ortho-position) on tyrosine residues of the NMDA receptor enhances nitration. Since in vitro nitration of the NMDA receptor increases the affinity of the glutamate recognition site and the receptor ion channel, we speculate that tyrosine dephosphorylation of the NMDA receptor will remove steric hindrance and facilitate nitration of tyrosine residues resulting in increased ion-channel activation in the hypoxic newborn brain."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

This search for susceptibility genes is hampered by several methodological limitations, and environmental risk factors for the disease (requiring incorporation into analyses) remain misunderstood. Among them, childhood trauma is probably the most promising environmental factor for further investigation. The objectives are to review the arguments in favor of an association between childhood trauma and bipolar disorder and to discuss the interpretations of such an observation. We computed a literature search using PubMed to identify relevant publications concerning childhood trauma and bipolar disorder. We also present some personal data in this field. Growing evidence suggests that incidences of childhood trauma are frequent and severe in bipolar disorder, probably affect the clinical expression of the disease in terms of suicidal behavior and age at onset, and also have an insidious influence on the affective functioning of patients between episodes. The relationships between childhood trauma and bipolar disorder suggest several interpretations, mainly a causal link, a neurodevelopmental consequence, or the intergenerational transmission of traumatic experiences. The neurobiological consequences of childhood trauma on a maturing brain remain unclear, although such stressors may alter the organization of brain development, leading to inadequate affective regulation. Childhood trauma is associated with bipolar disorder and its clinical expression and may interact with genetic susceptibility factors. Although not completely understood, the relationships between childhood trauma and bipolar disorder require further attention. Several suggestions for further exploration of this environmental factor and of its interaction with susceptibility genes are proposed."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

The article aims to describe and conceptualize this underresearched practice and to explore the challenges workers face when implementing it. The study described here included 20 in-depth interviews conducted with social workers working in an innovative Israeli child protection program called Families on the Path to Growth. The program is based on the Poverty-Aware paradigm and provides social workers and families with a substantial flexible budget designated for families' needs. Findings revealed that utilizing material assistance is an extremely complex and multidimensional task. Specifically, workers' engagement with this practice revolved around three continuums that range between (a) collaboration and countercollaboration; (b) splitting and integrating the emotional and the material; and (c) a hermeneutic of trust and a hermeneutic of suspicion. In the discussion, we explore the findings in relation to Nancy Fraser's conceptualization of social justice, redistribution, and recognition.

Based on this common pathophysiological root we can assume that the SA can be skin markers of HPS. The objective of this study is to assess whether there is a relationship between the presence of SA and HPS. Records of 40 patients with liver cirrhosis who underwent contrast echocardiography were evaluated, in which we researched the description of SA, physical examination, and other clinical and laboratory data. For diagnosis of HPS we use these signs of the disease: presence of liver disease (cirrhosis in the case), abnormalities in gas exchange by arterial blood gases, and evidence of pulmonary vasodilations by the contrast echocardiography. The SA were found in 21/40 (52.5%) patients and hepatopulmonary syndrome in 9/40 (22.5%). The HPS was observed in 8/21 (38.1%) of patients with SA and 1/19 (5.3%) patients were without this sign (P<0.01). We found no statistically significant difference between the SA and the presence of HPS with sex or age.

The influence of rhIGF-I on the cytotoxicity of vincristine has not yet been studied. Furthermore, studies performed have been done under serum-free conditions, which are far from physiological. We studied the influence of rhIGF-I on the growth of two rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines (Rh30 and Rh1) and on the antitumor effects of vincristine, cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, and topotecan under serum-free and serum-containing conditions.

In vitro, both cell lines demonstrated a functional type I IGF receptor, as shown by the rapid activation of ribosomal p70 S6 kinase after stimulation with rhIGF-I. Under serum-free conditions, rhIGF-I stimulated growth of both cell lines. Exposure to cytotoxic drugs with and without rhIGF-I resulted in higher cell numbers in cultures exposed to rhIGF-I. However, relative to the appropriate control, fractional growth inhibition and or cell kill of the cytotoxic drugs was identical with and without rhIGF-I. Under serum-containing conditions, rhIGF-I had no effect on cell growth or drug cytotoxicity. In vivo we did not find a significant influence of rhIGF-I on HxRh30 cell growth, or on the antitumor activity of vincristine. These studies show that rhIGF-I has no adverse effects on human rhabdomyosarcoma growth or on the antitumor effect of cytotoxic drugs under serum-containing conditions in vitro or in tumor-bearing mice.

The most commonly identified stressors were relationship loss, \"not being there for me,\" nonsupportive/hostile experiences, transitioning into adulthood, and boredom. Resilience strategies included developing and maintaining relationships with others, being responsible, creating systems of reciprocity, practicing subsistence living, and giving back to family and the community. These opportunities allowed youth to gain a sense of competence and mastery.

We previously reported a significant inverse correlation between Myc promoter-binding protein-1 (MBP-1) and ERBB2 expression in primary breast invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). MBP-1 is a transcriptional repressor of the c-MYC gene that acts by binding to the P2 promoter; only one other direct target of MBP-1, the COX2 gene, has been identified so far. To gain new insights into the functional relationship linking MBP-1 and ERBB2 in breast cancer, we have investigated the effects of MBP-1 expression on endogenous ERBB2 transcript and protein levels, as well as on transcription promoter activity, by transient-transfection of SKBr3 cells. Reporter gene and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were used to dissect the ERBB2 promoter and identify functional MBP-1 target sequences. We also investigated the relative expression of MBP-1 and HDAC1 in IDC and normal breast tissues by immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Transfection experiments and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in SKBr3 cells indicated that MBP-1 negatively regulates the ERBB2 gene by binding to a genomic region between nucleotide -514 and -262 of the proximal promoter; consistent with this, a concomitant recruitment of HDAC1 and loss of acetylated histone H4 was observed. In addition, we found high expression of MBP-1 and HDAC1 in normal tissues and a statistically significant inverse correlation with ErbB2 expression in the paired tumor samples. Altogether, our in vitro and in vivo data indicate that the ERBB2 gene is a novel MBP-1 target, and immunohistochemistry analysis of primary tumors suggests that the concomitant high expression of MBP-1 and HDAC1 may be considered a diagnostic marker of cancer progression for breast IDC."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

The structural and functional analyses of the gene responsible of their degradation are an important aspect for environmental studies and are important to human well-being. It has been shown that some haloacids are toxic and mutagenic. Microorganisms capable of degrading these haloacids can be found in the natural environment. One of these, a soil-borne Burkholderia mallei posses the ability to grow on monobromoacetate (MBA). This bacterium produces a haloacid dehalogenase that allows the cell to grow on MBA, a highly toxic and mutagenic environmental pollutant. For the structural and functional analysis, a 346 amino acid encoding protein sequence of haloacid dehalogenase is retrieve from NCBI data base. Primary and secondary structure analysis suggested that the high percentage of helices in the structure makes the protein more flexible for folding, which might increase protein interactions. The consensus protein sub-cellular localization predictions suggest that dehalogenase protein is a periplasmic protein 3D2GO server, suggesting that it is mainly employed in metabolic process followed by hydrolase activity and catalytic activity. The tertiary structure of protein was predicted by homology modeling. The result suggests that the protein is an unstable protein which is also an important characteristic of active enzyme enabling them to bind various cofactors and substrate for proper functioning.

All three proteins are localized at replication foci (RF), but in contrast to PCNA, Ligase and Fen1 were readily extracted. Dual photobleaching combined with time overlays revealed a rapid exchange of Ligase and Fen1 at RF, which is consistent with de novo loading at every Okazaki fragment, while the slow recovery of PCNA mostly occurred at adjacent, newly assembled RF. These data indicate that PCNA works as a stationary loading platform that is reused for multiple Okazaki fragments, while PCNA binding proteins only transiently associate and are not stable components of the replication machinery."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

The binding of CSBP to MAPKAP kinase-3 was confirmed in vitro by the precipitation of epitope-tagged CSBP1, CSBP2, and CSBP2(D168A) and endogenous CSBP from mammalian cells by a bacterially expressed GST-MAPKAP kinase-3 fusion protein and in vivo by co-precipitation of the epitope-tagged proteins co-expressed in HeLa cells. MAPKAP kinase-3 was phosphorylated by both CSBP1 and CSBP2 and was then able to phosphorylate HSP27 in vitro. Treatment of HeLa cells with sorbitol or TNF resulted in activation of CSBP and MAPKAP kinase-3 and activation of MAPKAP kinase-3 could be blocked by preincubation of cells with SB203580, a specific inhibitor of CSBP kinase activity.

Here, we analyzed and compared microbial communities on waste plastic films (WPFs) buried for long periods at four landfill sites with those in nearby soils to identify microbes with the potential to degrade plastics. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy spectra of these WPFs showed that most were polyethylene and had signs of oxidation, such as carbon-carbon double bonds, carbon-oxygen single bonds, or hydrogen-oxygen single bonds, but the presence of carbonyl groups was rare. The species richness and diversity of the bacterial and fungal communities on the films were generally lower than those in nearby soils. Principal coordinate analysis of the bacterial and fungal communities showed that their overall structures were determined by their geographical locations; however, the microbial communities on the films were generally different from those in the soils. For the pulled data from the four landfill sites, the relative abundances of Bradyrhizobiaceae, Pseudarthrobacter, Myxococcales, Sphingomonas, and Spartobacteria were higher on films than in soils at the bacterial genus level. At the species level, operational taxonomic units classified as Bradyrhizobiaceae and Pseudarthrobacter in bacteria and Mortierella in fungi were enriched on the films. PICRUSt analysis showed that the predicted functions related to amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism and xenobiotic degradation were more abundant on films than in soils.

The public release of voluminous data from the Library of Integrated Cellular Signatures (LINCS) programme further enhanced the utilities and potentials of gene expression connectivity mapping in biomedicine. We describe QUADrATiC ( http://go.qub.ac.uk/QUADrATiC ), a user-friendly tool for the exploration of gene expression connectivity on the subset of the LINCS data set corresponding to FDA-approved small molecule compounds. It enables the identification of compounds for repurposing therapeutic potentials. The software is designed to cope with the increased volume of data over existing tools, by taking advantage of multicore computing architectures to provide a scalable solution, which may be installed and operated on a range of computers, from laptops to servers. This scalability is provided by the use of the modern concurrent programming paradigm provided by the Akka framework. The QUADrATiC Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been developed using advanced Javascript frameworks, providing novel visualization capabilities for further analysis of connections. There is also a web services interface, allowing integration with other programs or scripts. QUADrATiC has been shown to provide an improvement over existing connectivity map software, in terms of scope (based on the LINCS data set), applicability (using FDA-approved compounds), usability and speed. It offers potential to biological researchers to analyze transcriptional data and generate potential therapeutics for focussed study in the lab.

A total of 1766 large landslides were identified based on integrated remote sensing interpretations utilizing multisource satellite images and topographic data that were dominated by 3 major regional categories, namely, rockslides, rock falls, and flow-like landslides. The geographical detector method was applied to quantitatively unveil the spatial association between the landslides and 12 environmental factors through computation of the q values based on spatially stratified heterogeneity. Meanwhile, a certainty factor (CF) model was used for comparison. The results indicate that the q values of the 12 influencing factors vary obviously, and the dominant factors are also different for the 3 types of landslides, with annual mean precipitation (AMP) being the dominant factor for rockslide distribution, elevation being the dominant factor for rock fall distribution and lithology being the dominant factor for flow-like distribution. Integrating the results of the factor detector and ecological detector, the AMP, annual mean temperature (AMT), elevation, river density, fault distance and lithology have a stronger influence on the spatial distribution of landslides than other factors. Furthermore, the factor interactions can significantly enhance their interpretability of landslides, and the top 3 dominant interactions were revealed. Based on statistics of landslide discrepancies with respect to diverse stratification of each factor, the high-risk zones were identified for 3 types of landslides, and the results were contrasted with the CF model.

Such systems can be useful to evaluate the catch composition as well. In demersal trawl fisheries, however, their applicability can be challenged by low light conditions, mobilized sediment and scattering in murky waters. In this study, we introduce a novel observation system (called NepCon) which aims at reducing current limitations by combining an optimized image acquisition setup and tailored image analyses software. The NepCon system includes a high-contrast background to enhance the visibility of the target objects, a compact camera and an artificial light source. The image analysis software includes a machine learning algorithm which is evaluated here to test automatic detection and count of Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus). NepCon is specifically designed for applications in demersal trawls and this first phase aims at increasing the accuracy of N. norvegicus detection at the data acquisition level. To find the best contrasting background for the purpose we compared the output of four image segmentation methods applied to static images of N. norvegicus fixed in front of four test background colors. The background color with the best performance was then used to evaluate computer vision and deep learning approaches for automatic detection, tracking and counting of N. norvegicus in the videos.

Furthermore, the related delays significantly increase patient mortality and make inefficient use of resources to the detriment of the satisfaction of employees and patients. In this work, lean thinking is applied to the ED of Cardarelli Hospital of Naples with the aim of increasing patient flow, improving the processes that contribute to facilitating the flow of patients through the various stages of medical treatment and eliminating all bottlenecks (queue) as well as all activities that generate waste. This project was performed at National Hospital A.O.R.N. A. Cardarelli of Naples. The historical times of access to the ED were analysed from January 2015 to June 2015, for a total of 16,563 records. Subsequently, starting in November 2015, corrective actions were implemented according to the Lean Approach. Data collected after the introduced improvements were collected from April 2016 to June 2016 and compared to those collected during the starting period. The results acquired before application of the Lean Thinking strategy illustrated the as-is process with its drawbacks. An analysis of the non-added value activities was performed to identify the procedures that need to be improved. After implementation of the corrective actions, we observed a positive increase in the performance of the ED, quantified as percentages of hospitalized patients according to triage codes and waiting times. This work demonstrates the applicability of Lean Thinking to ED processes and its effectiveness in terms of increasing the efficiency of services and reducing waste (waiting times)."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

We enrolled patients with primary pancreatic cancer and benign pancreatic cystic disease (n = 163). We performed sensitivity tests for multiple tumor markers, plotted receiver operating characteristic curves, and conducted multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard method. Survival data were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival. Among multiple tumor markers assessed in this study, CA 19-9 showed good diagnostic performance, with an area under the curve of 0.86 \u00b1 0.04 in ROC analysis. Based on two different cutoff values, CYFRA 21-1 (\u2265 2.0 and 1.83 ng/mL) had a respective sensitivity of 80.4% and 82.3% and was also more significant than the other tumor markers in a parallel test. There was a weak significant relationship between tumoral fluorodeoxyglucose uptake and CYFRA 21-1 or CA 19-9. Initial CA 125, CYFRA 21-1, and CEA could be utilized to categorize subgroups with different overall survival. In multivariate analyses, CA 125 (HR 18.8, p < 0.001) and CYFRA 21-1 levels (HR 0.962, p = 0.006) demonstrated independent prognostic significance for predicting overall survival.

In this paper, a new method based on deep neural networks is proposed for accurate extraction of a lesion region. The input image is preprocessed, and then, its patches are fed to a convolutional neural network. Local texture and global structure of the patches are processed in order to assign pixels to lesion or normal classes. A method for effective selection of training patches is proposed for more accurate detection of a lesion's border. Our results indicate that the proposed method could reach the accuracy of 98.7% and the sensitivity of 95.2% in segmentation of lesion regions over the dataset of clinical images. The experimental results of qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method can outperform other state-of-the-art algorithms exist in the literature."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

(1) Funding from the NIH is critical if new procedures and devices are to be developed. (2) The success rate for NIH applications coming from cardiothoracic surgery faculty is thought to be inferior. (3) Per capita numbers of surgical NIH application and awards and application success rate have recently been found to be below the average for the NIH. Application and award data for full-time academic cardiothoracic surgeons were obtained by matching records in the NIH IMPAC II database with membership rosters of The Society of Thoracic Surgeons and The American Association for Thoracic Surgery. Manpower data were obtained from 1999, 2003, and 2005 reports of the STS/AATS Workforce committee. Society membership was used as a surrogate for investigator experience. The number of NIH applications has increased steeply in the past 7 years; however, the number of awards has remained constant. This pattern was observed for surgery and cardiothoracic surgery as well. Until 2003, the cardiothoracic surgery application success rate was actually higher than that of surgery and the NIH as a whole (between 25% and 40%). Since then, however, the cardiothoracic surgery application success rate has declined steeply and is now only 14%. NIH applications and awards per 100 cardiothoracic surgeons, although similar to those of surgery, are very much less than the NIH as a whole. Per capita NIH funding of cardiothoracic surgeons is very much less than that of the NIH as a whole. The primary cause is the low per capita number of applications submitted by cardiothoracic surgeons. Junior cardiothoracic faculty should be encouraged to apply for career development awards. However, since the ability to shift cost from clinical to academic faculty is declining, affirmative action from the NIH may be necessary."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

To eliminate problems associated with raw material inhomogeneity, processing was conducted on a pilot-plant scale under operating conditions of industrial practice. Inherent product heterogeneity caused by diverse lettuce leaf tissues was compensated for by pooling large-sized samples, and frequent sampling ensured significant data about the activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and peroxidase (POD), as well as the contents of caffeic acid derivatives over storage time. In the homogeneous lettuce samples, specific responses caused by different washing procedures were detectable. PAL activity in the samples increased for up to 5-8 days of storage. Compared to tap and ozonated water, the use of chlorinated water (100-200 mg/L free chlorine) for washing trimmed heads or shredded lettuce significantly reduced PAL activity and the concomitant rise of 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (isochlorogenic acid isomer) concentrations.

Therefore, we hypothesize that genetic background may play a role in modulating disease expression. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) aggregate effects of common genetic variants to investigate whether, cumulatively, these variants are associated with disease penetrance or severity. However, the major limitations in this field have been in generating sufficient sample sizes for these studies. Here we used CHD-phenotype matched genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from the UK Biobank (UKBB) as our base study and whole-genome sequencing data from the CHD cohort (n1\u00a0= 711 trios, n2\u00a0= 362 European trios) of the Gabriella Miller Kids First dataset as our target study to develop PRSs for CHD. PRSs estimated using a GWAS for heart valve problems and heart murmur explain 2.5% of the variance in case-control status of CHD (all SNVs, p\u00a0= 7.90\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-3; fetal cardiac SNVs, p\u00a0= 8.00\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-3) and 1.8% of the variance in severity of CHD (fetal cardiac SNVs, p\u00a0= 6.20\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-3; all SNVs, p\u00a0= 0.015).

We iteratively developed physician clinic note prototypes with features designed to emphasize more important information and de-emphasize less clinically relevant information. Sixteen primary care physicians reviewed comparable clinic notes with the 4 note styles presented in random order to find key information in the notes during timed tasks. The 4 note styles were denoted A (traditional SOAP note), B (2-column APSO note), C (collapsible APSO note), and D (2-column collapsible APSO note). The 4 unique note styles were designed to have equal amounts of information in each section. We simulated their utility for clinical practice by imposing time limits and by interrupting 1 of the tasks with a typical clinical interruption. For each session, we recorded audio, computer-screen activity, eye tracking, and made field notes. We obtained usability ratings (System Usability Scale), new feature preference ratings, and performed semistructured post-task interviews with subsequent content analysis. We compared the effectiveness of the 4 note styles by measuring time on task, task success (accuracy), and effort as measured by NASA Task Load Index. Note styles C and D were significantly faster than A and B for the Review of Systems and Physical Examination tasks, as we expected. Notes B and C had the best success (finding requested data) scores. Users strongly endorsed all the new note features incorporated into the new note prototypes. Previously expressed concerns about temporarily hiding parts of the note (using the accordion display design pattern) were allayed. Usability ratings for note A were worst but comparably better for note styles B, C, and D. The new APSO note prototypes performed better than the traditional SOAP note format for speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary care.

We show here that knockout or knockdown of ATRX in mortal cells or immortal telomerase-positive cells is insufficient to activate ALT. Notably, however, in SV40-transformed mortal fibroblasts ATRX loss results in either a significant increase in the proportion of cell lines activating ALT (instead of telomerase) or in a significant decrease in the time prior to ALT activation. These data indicate that loss of ATRX function cooperates with one or more as-yet unidentified genetic or epigenetic alterations to activate ALT.

However, the transcriptional components that are directly targeted by AMPK are still elusive. The peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) has emerged as a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis; furthermore, it has been shown that PGC-1alpha gene expression is induced by exercise and by chemical activation of AMPK in skeletal muscle. Using primary muscle cells and mice deficient in PGC-1alpha, we found that the effects of AMPK on gene expression of glucose transporter 4, mitochondrial genes, and PGC-1alpha itself are almost entirely dependent on the function of PGC-1alpha protein. Furthermore, AMPK phosphorylates PGC-1alpha directly both in vitro and in cells. These direct phosphorylations of the PGC-1alpha protein at threonine-177 and serine-538 are required for the PGC-1alpha-dependent induction of the PGC-1alpha promoter. These data indicate that AMPK phosphorylation of PGC-1alpha initiates many of the important gene regulatory functions of AMPK in skeletal muscle."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

However, the evidence for this approach in T2D is limited. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of an educational programme in BCC as add-on to the usual dietary care on glycaemic control in people with T2D. The study is designed as a randomised, controlled trial with a parallel-group design. The study duration is 12 months with data collection at baseline, and after 6 and 12 months. We plan to include 226 adults with T2D. Participants will be randomised to one of two interventions: (1) BCC as add-on to usual dietary care or (2) usual dietary care. The primary outcome is changes in glycated haemoglobin A1c or mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions from baseline and after 6-month intervention between and within study groups. Further outcome measures include changes in time in range, body weight and composition, lipid profile, blood pressure, mathematical literacy skills, carbohydrate estimation accuracy, dietary intake, diet-related quality of life, perceived competencies in diet and diabetes and perceptions of an autonomy supportive dietician-led climate, physical activity and urinary biomarkers.

The purpose of this evaluation was to pilot test integrating synthetic data within an existing dataset of complex medication data to improve machine learning model prediction of fluid overload. This retrospective cohort study evaluated patients admitted to an ICU \u2265 72\u00a0h. Four machine learning algorithms to predict fluid overload after 48-72\u00a0h of ICU admission were developed using the original dataset. Then, two distinct synthetic data generation methodologies (synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) and conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN)) were used to create synthetic data. Finally, a stacking ensemble technique designed to train a meta-learner was established. Models underwent training in three scenarios of varying qualities and quantities of datasets. Training machine learning algorithms on the combined synthetic and original dataset overall increased the performance of the predictive models compared to training on the original dataset. The highest performing model was the meta-model trained on the combined dataset with 0.83 AUROC while it managed to significantly enhance the sensitivity across different training scenarios. The integration of synthetically generated data is the first time such methods have been applied to ICU medication data and offers a promising solution to enhance the performance of machine learning models for fluid overload, which may be translated to other ICU outcomes. A meta-learner was able to make a trade-off between different performance metrics and improve the ability to identify the minority class."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

There was a need to develop alternative approaches for stable patients to access medication. With the onset of the coronavirus pandemic there was an urgent need to decongest facilities and protect people from infection. In this crisis the Metro Health Services rapidly implemented home delivery of medication by community health workers. This study aimed to evaluate the implementation of home delivery of medication by community health workers during the coronavirus pandemic in Cape Town, South Africa. A convergent mixed methods study evaluated six implementation outcomes: adoption, feasibility, fidelity, coverage, cost, and sustainability of the initiative. Data sources included routinely collected data, a telephonic survey of 138 patients, an analysis of set-up and recurrent costs as well as 17 descriptive exploratory qualitative semi-structured interviews with 68 key informants. Over a 6-month period 1,054,657 pre-packaged parcels were sent to primary care facilities, 819,649 (77.7%) were delivered and of those 97,297 (11.9%) returned. The additional costs were estimated as 1.3% of a total health budget of R2,2 billion. The initiative was rapidly adopted as it decongested facilities and protected vulnerable patients. Although it was feasible to implement at scale, numerous challenges were encountered, such as incorrect addresses and contact details, transporting parcels, communicating with patients, having a reliable audit trail, and handling out-of-area patients. All role players thought the service should continue and 42.3% of patients reported better adherence to their medication. Home delivery of medication by community health workers is feasible at scale and affordable. It should continue, but as one of a menu of options for alternative delivery of medication. The following need to be improved: efficiency of the system, the audit trail, adequate support and resources for community health workers, transport of medication, communication with patients, empanelment of patients, governance of the system and training of the community health workers."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

To evaluate the strength, the ventrodorsal force was measured with atlantoaxial ligaments intact, after removing the ligaments, and after applying conventional wire or SMA implants to stabilize the atlantoaxial joint. The time taken for implant application was measured. No significant difference in vertebral body size of the atlas and axis was observed. A significant difference in vertebral canal size was observed between the animals. In biomechanical testing, the SMA-2 implant provided more stabilization, while the SMA-1 implant had lower strength than the conventional method using wires. The application time of wire was the longest, while that of SMA-1 was the shortest. SMA implants provide comparable strength and demonstrate superior efficacy compared to conventional dorsal wire fixation of atlantoaxial stabilization.

The protection conferred by this factor was mainly cell mediated but immune serum enhanced this immunity despite the fact that no antibodies were detected in it. The protective activity of this factor was sensitive to RNase digestion but resistant to proteolytic enzymes. Ion exchange chromatography of this factor with DEAE-Sephadex A-25 (in 7 M Urea-0.02 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5) resulted in a single A260 peak which was found to be immunogenic.

We created lytR mutant strains from two independent S. pyogenes strains to analyze the function of LytR. The protease assay in culture supernatant showed that lytR mutant had the higher cysteine protease activity than wild-type. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and western blotting analysis revealed that the amount of cysteine protease, SpeB in lytR mutant was more compared with that in wild-type. The level of speB mRNA in lytR mutant also increased compared with that of wild-type. The membrane integrity and potential in lytR mutant also were decreased compared with that of wild-type. Murine infection model showed that less survival was detected in mice inoculated with lytR mutant than that with wild-type, and the size of wound lesion of mice with lytR mutant was larger than that with wild-type.

Data on hospitalization from the two largest hospitals in HCMC and daily records of PM10, NO2, SO2, O3 and meteorological data were collected from February 2004 to December 2007. A time-series regression analysis with distributed lag model was applied for data analysis. Changes in levels of NO2 and PM10 were strongly associated with hospital admissions for both respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (CVD); whereas levels of SO2 were only moderately associated with respiratory and CVD hospital admissions and O3 concentration was not associated with any of them. For a 10\u03bcg/m(3) increase of each air pollutant, the risk of respiratory admissions increased from 0.7% to 8% while the risk of CVD admissions increased from 0.5% to 4%. Females were found to be more sensitive than males to exposure to air pollutants in regard to respiratory diseases. In regard to CVD, females (RR, 1.04, 95% CI, 1.01-1.07) had a slightly higher risk of admissions than males (RR, 1.03, 95% CI, 1-1.06) to exposure to NO2.

Adult gymnasts who had been retired for 8 years had no deficit in sitting height, leg length, or menstrual dysfunction.

It represents failure of adaptation of pulmonary circulation to the extrauterine environment causing severe hypoxemia in affected newborns. Few data have weighed the relationship of ventricular dysfunction in the context of PPHN and the outcome in involved patients. The aim of this paper is to study ventricular functions in newborns with PPHN and to determine whether short-term outcome is closely related or not to ventricular dysfunction occurring in PPHN.Methods: Thirty full-term neonates with PPHN were screened with conventional echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) for the assessment of ventricular functions at the start of treatment for PPHN, demographic data and Arterial blood gazes were performed as well. The echocardiographic data were compared to healthy age-matched controls. The sensitivity and specificity of relevant echocardiographic data to predict the short-term (Day 3) outcome of patients were measured. Results: Patients with PPHN had both left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction when compared to controls, RV Tei (Cases: 0.39\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 versus controls: 0.29\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08, p\u2009<\u2009.01) LV Tei (Cases: 0.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04 versus controls: 0.25\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02, p\u2009<\u2009.01), LV functions were found of greatest prediction of negative outcome in cases with PPHN than RV Tei. Conclusion: The aforementioned findings are sight opening towards the importance of LV dysfunction in PPHN, LV dysfunction might occur in PPHN as a result of RV-LV interactions and the observed involvement might be an important aggravating factor of PPHN."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

Due to resistance to standard of care, GBMs relapse in almost all patients. Targeting GSCs using transcriptional CDK inhibitors, CYC065 and THZ1 is a potential novel treatment to prevent relapse of the tumour. TCGA-GBM data analysis has shown that the GSC markers, CD133 and CD44 were significantly upregulated in GBM patient tumours compared to non-tumour tissue. CD133 and CD44 stem cell markers were also expressed in gliomaspheres derived from recurrent GBM tumours. Light Sheet Florescence Microscopy (LSFM) further revealed heterogeneous expression of these GSC markers in gliomaspheres. Gliomaspheres from recurrent tumours were highly sensitive to transcriptional CDK inhibitors, CYC065 and THZ1 and underwent apoptosis while being resistant to TMZ.

Sequence analysis of the tfdR gene revealed an open reading frame with amino acid sequence similar to the LysR family of transcriptional activators. The tfdR gene is located upstream and transcribed divergently from the tfdCB operon. Utilizing primer extension analysis, the transcription initiation sites of the gene tfdR and the tfdCB operon were localized 85 (84)bp and 292bp upstream from the coding sequences of these genes, respectively. Multiple sequence analysis revealed that the genes tfdR, tfdC and tfdB of plasmid pEST4011 are most similar to the regulatory gene tfdR and the module 2 genes tfdC(II) and tfdB(II) of pJP4, respectively. The promoter-operator sequences of tfdR and its target tfdCB operon of pEST4011 have regions with highly conserved nucleotides characteristic for the catechol-subgroup LysR-type transcriptional activators. We showed that the pEST4011 tfdR gene product activates the expression of the tfdCB operon and the effector molecule for TfdR is 2,4-dichloro-cis,cis-muconate.

Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was performed on Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates to identify patients infected with the same strain. Using RFLP and clinical and epidemiologic data, we identified the most likely source case and site of transmission for 79 patients. Homelessness, birth in the United States and Native American ethnicity were independent predictors of being a source case, but HIV infection was not. Three homeless shelters were sites of tuberculosis transmission for 55 (70%) of the 79 patients. HIV-infected patients constituted 27% (66/249) of the study population, but only 17% (13/79) of patients were infected by an HIV-infected source case. We conclude that transmission of tuberculosis in central Los Angeles was highly focal, and that the major transmission sites were three homeless shelters.

The exclusion of coronary calcification is the most accurate noninvasive method to exclude significant coronary stenosis whereas the detection of calcification identifies coronary arteriosclerosis. The total calcium load correlates with the risk of coronary stenosis, but there is not a 1 : 1 relationship. CT angiography with contrast enhancement offers promises to increase diagnostic accuracy. 4-slice scanners acquire data with a slide width down to 1 mm. The spatial resolution of invasive coronary angiography cannot be achieved yet. Severe coronary stenosis may be excluded with 90% specificity if image quality is not impaired by artifacts, severe calcification, arrhythmia, and a heart rate > 70 beats/min. With present technology, about 26% of segments may not be adequately assessed. Despite these limitations CT angiography is a useful tool to reduce the number of invasive diagnostic angiography. In patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD), progression as well as stent occlusion can be assessed. Instent stenosis can only be diagnosed indirectly. The patency of arterial and venous grafts can be assessed very well including also the bypass insertion site. Actual studies on the significance of noncalcified plaques are in progress. A CT angiography should take place in order to avoid further exposure to radiation. Therefore, patients with typical angina or significant signs of coronary ischemia have to be investigated by invasive methods and do not profit from a CT scan. Preparation and implementation of this method should only be applied in cooperation with radiologists and cardiologists in an experienced center."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

However, the dynamics and multiple patterns of spatiotemporal dependencies make this problem challenging. Most existing methods suffer from two major shortcomings: (1) They ignore the local context semantics when modeling temporal dependencies. (2) They lack the ability to capture the spatial dependencies of multiple patterns. To tackle such issues, we propose a novel Transformer-based model for multivariate time series forecasting, called the spatial-temporal convolutional Transformer network (STCTN). STCTN mainly consists of two novel attention mechanisms to respectively model temporal and spatial dependencies. Local-range convolutional attention mechanism is proposed in STCTN to simultaneously focus on both global and local context temporal dependencies at the sequence level, which addresses the first shortcoming. Group-range convolutional attention mechanism is designed to model multiple spatial dependency patterns at graph level, as well as reduce the computation and memory complexity, which addresses the second shortcoming. Continuous positional encoding is proposed to link the historical observations and predicted future values in positional encoding, which also improves the forecasting performance. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets show that the proposed STCTN outperforms the start-of-the-art methods and is more robust to nonsmooth time series data."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

Tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is considered to be a novel anticancer agent; however, recent studies have shown that many pancreatic cancer cells are resistant to apoptosis induction by TRAIL due to TRAIL-activated nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signalling. Several chemopreventive agents are able to inhibit NF-kappaB, and favourable results have been obtained--for example, for the broccoli compound sulforaphane-in preventing metastasis in clinical studies. The aim of the study was to identify TICs in pancreatic carcinoma for analysis of resistance mechanisms and for definition of sensitising agents. TICs were defined by expression patterns of a CD44(+)/CD24(-), CD44(+)/CD24(+) or CD44(+)/CD133(+) phenotype and correlation to growth in immunodeficient mice, differentiation grade, clonogenic growth, sphere formation, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity and therapy resistance. Mechanistically, specific binding of transcriptionally active cRel-containing NF-kappaB complexes in TICs was observed. Sulforaphane prevented NF-kappaB binding, downregulated apoptosis inhibitors and induced apoptosis, together with prevention of clonogenicity. Gemcitabine, the chemopreventive agents resveratrol and wogonin, and the death ligand TRAIL were less effective. In a xenograft model, sulforaphane strongly blocked tumour growth and angiogenesis, while combination with TRAIL had an additive effect without obvious cytotoxicity in normal cells. Freshly isolated patient tumour cells expressing markers for TICs could be sensitised by sulforaphane for TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity. The data provide new insights into resistance mechanisms of TICs and suggest the combination of sulforaphane with TRAIL as a promising strategy for targeting of pancreatic TICs."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

Multiple milk ejections (5.1\u00b12.0; range, two to 14) were detected as increases in milk flow rate. A larger total expression volume was associated with a higher maximum milk flow rate (p<0.001). However, 14% less of the available milk was removed for a 100\u2009g increase in available milk (p<0.001). After 2.9\u00b11.4 and 6.0\u00b12.5 minutes, 50% and 80%, respectively, of the total expression volume was removed. Milk flow was more active in the first 7 minutes than the last 7 minutes. At the eighth minute (midpoint), 54\u00b125% of the available milk and 86\u00b19% of the total expression volume were removed. The maximum milk flow rate was predictive of the total volume expressed. After the eighth minute of expression the milk flow rate was reduced. Increasing volumes of milk in the breast were associated with less complete breast emptying.

As a result, three of the five species are now considered to be critically endangered, one species is vulnerable and one species is near-threatened. Poaching has increased dramatically over the past decade due to a growing demand for rhino horn products, primarily in Asia. Improved wildlife forensic techniques, such as validated tests for species identification of seized horns, are critical to aid current enforcement and prosecution efforts and provide a deterrent to future rhino horn trafficking. Here, we present an internationally standardized species identification test based on a 230 base pair cytochrome-b region. This test improves on previous nested PCR protocols and can be used for the discrimination of samples with <20pg of template DNA, thus suitable for DNA extracted from horn products. The assay was designed to amplify water buffalo samples, a common 'rhino horn' substitute, but to exclude human DNA, a common contaminant. Phylogenetic analyses using this partial cytochrome-b region resolved the five extant rhino species. Testing successfully returned a sequence and correct identification for all of the known rhino horn samples and vouchered rhino samples from museum and zoo collections, and provided species level identification for 47 out of 52 unknown samples from seizures. Validation and standardization was carried out across five different laboratories, in four different countries, demonstrating it to be an effective and reproducible test, robust to inter laboratory variation in equipment and consumables (such as PCR reagents). This is one of the first species identification tests to be internationally standardized to produce data for evidential proceedings and the first published validated test for rhinos, one of the flagship species groups of the illegal wildlife trade and for which forensic tools are urgently required. This study serves as a model for how species identification tests should be standardized and disseminated for wildlife forensic testing."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

We explore an approach to estimating cost-effective prices which uses aggregate data including estimated lifetime costs of dementia, both financial and quality of life, and incorporates a range of assumptions regarding sustainability of short- term gains and other parameters. The approach is addressed in the context of the theoretical reduction in a range of risk factors, and in the context of a specific small-scale trial of an internet-based intervention augmented with diet and physical activity consultations. The principal outcomes were prices per unit of interventions at which interventions were cost-effective or cost-saving. Taking a societal perspective, a notional intervention reducing a range of dementia risk-factors by 5% was cost-effective at $A460 per person with higher risk groups at $2,148 per person. even if program effect diminished by 75% over time.

ATP (10 microM) was used to increase hydraulic conductivity (Lp) and [Ca2+]i in venular microvessel in frog mesentery. The cAMP analogue, 8-bromo-cAMP (8-BrcAMP, 2 mM) significantly attenuated the initial increase in Lp (from a peak increase of 7.1 +/- 2.4 times control with ATP alone to 1.2 +/- 0.34 times control with ATP and cAMP). In contrast, cAMP did not significantly change the magnitude or time course of the biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i, which increased from 54 +/- 5 nM to peak of 187 +/- 48 nM with ATP alone, and from 55 +/- 8 nM to 190 +/- 28 nM with ATP and cAMP. Thus the action of cAMP to attenuate microvessel permeability increase in the presence of ATP does not involve modification of the initial Ca2+ transient in endothelial cells. Our results enable alternative hypotheses, such as the suggestion that cAMP might modulate a Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent actin-myosin cascade, to be investigated without the added complications of having to account for the modulation of initial changes in [Ca2+]i.

We verify its mechanical characteristics, derive and validate a kinetostatic model and demonstrate controllability and imaging capabilities on an ultrasound phantom. The soft robot exhibits the desired stiffness characteristics and is able to reach 100% of the required workspace when no external force is present, and 95% of the workspace when considering its compliance. The model can accurately predict the end-effector pose with a mean error of 1.18\u00b10.29\u00a0mm in position and 0.92\u00b10.47\u00b0 in orientation. The derived controller is, with an average position error of 0.39\u00a0mm, able to track a target pose efficiently without and with externally applied loads. Ultrasound images acquired with the system are of equally good quality compared to a manual sonographer scan. The system is able to withstand loads commonly applied during foetal ultrasound scans and remains controllable with a motion range similar to manual scanning. The proposed soft robot presents a safe, cost-effective solution to offloading sonographers in day-to-day scanning routines.

Only 27.4% of smokers were aware of the benefit in 2002; use among all smokers was 13.6%. Of all smokers, 30.4% used smoking-cessation treatment medication (over-the-counter or covered) in 2002. Smoking prevalence was 15.6% in 2001 and 13.2% in 2002. In an educated employee population, self-reported smoking-cessation treatment benefit use was modest among all smokers during its first 2 years of availability. Benefit awareness was low in this educated population, which may help explain low use rates, particularly given the 30% of all smokers who attempted to quit smoking with the help of smoking-cessation treatment medication. These data provide use-rate estimates for states contemplating adoption of an evidence-based smoking-cessation treatment benefit."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

Spindle and kinetochore-associated complex subunit 3 (SKA3), located on chromosome 13q, was identified as a novel gene involved in promoting malignant transformation in cancers. However, the function and underlying mechanisms of SKA3 in CC remain unknown. Using the Oncomine database, we found that expression of SKA3 mRNA is higher in CC tissues than in normal tissues and is linked with poor prognosis. In our study, immunohistochemistry showed increased expression of SKA3 in CC tissues. The effect of SKA3 on cell proliferation and migration was evaluated by CCK8, clone formation, Transwell and wound-healing assays in HeLa and SiHa cells with stable SKA3 overexpression and knockdown. In addition, we established a xenograft tumor model in vivo. SKA3 overexpression promoted cell proliferation and migration and accelerated tumor growth. We further identified that SKA3 is involved in regulating cell cycle progression and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway via RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) and gene set enrichment analyses. Western blotting results revealed that SKA3 overexpression increased levels of p-Akt, cyclin E2, CDK2, cyclin D1, CDK4, E2F1 and p-Rb in HeLa cells. Additionally, the use of an Akt inhibitor (GSK690693) significantly reversed the cell proliferation capacity induced by SKA3 overexpression in HeLa cells. We suggest that SKA3 overexpression contributes to CC cell growth and migration by promoting cell cycle progression and activating the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which may provide potential novel therapeutic targets for CC treatment."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

To enhance PD detection accuracy, we propose a two-stage diagnostic system that refines the extracted set of features through [Formula: see text] regularized linear support vector machine and classifies the refined subset of features through a deep neural network. To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed diagnostic system, experiments are performed on two different voice recording-based benchmark datasets. For both datasets, the proposed diagnostic system achieves 100% accuracy under leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation (CV) and 97.5% accuracy under k-fold CV.

A qualitative phenomenological approach was followed. An initial purposeful sampling of Spanish residents in for-profit nursing homes in the southern area of Madrid was carried out. A theoretical sampling was also implemented in order to gain a more in-depth understanding of dependence. Inclusion criteria for nursing home residents were: age (60 years or older) and lack of any cognitive impairment. Data were collected using unstructured and semistructured interviews. Data collection was concluded once theoretical saturation was reached, and the data were analysed using the Giorgi proposal. A total of 26 residents with a mean age of 83 years were included. Three main themes that describe the significance of meals in nursing homes emerged from the data: (i) timing of the meals - mealtimes serve as a point of reference for organizing activities in the nursing home and orient the residents during the day; (ii) table allocation - table allocation depends on the judgment of the personnel, the behavior of each resident and on the input from the residents that use a table; and (iii) the meals themselves - food is experienced as a privilege, as a sign of autonomy and normality, and as an indicator of personal identity. Understanding the social significance of meals for residents in nursing homes would provide deeper insight into resident expectations. This will in turn help to improve service and quality of life for residents."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

To investigate the stiffness of anterior versus circumferential spinal reconstructions for different anatomic stages of tumor lesions. Metastatic tumors predominantly involve the vertebral bodies. Although anterior instrumentation and strut grafts provide excellent stability, it remains unclear to what extent vertebral destruction requires anterior reconstructions alone versus combined anterior and posterior procedures. Ten human cadaveric thoracolumbar spines were used. The L1 vertebral body and posterior elements were resected sequentially based on Weinstein's anatomic zone classification for tumor lesions. Anterior reconstruction was performed between T12 and L2 using an iliac strut graft and the Kaneda SR system (AcroMed, Cleveland, OH). For circumferential reconstruction, the Cotrel-Dubousset hook and rod system was combined with the anterior reconstruction procedure. Experimental groups included the intact condition and five reconstruction stages: anterior reconstructions for corpectomy, subtotal and total spondylectomies, and circumferential reconstructions for subtotal and total spondylectomies. Nondestructive biomechanical testing was performed under four different loading modes. All the reconstruction groups except anterior instrumentation alone for total spondylectomy returned stiffness to a level equivalent or higher to that of the intact spine. There were no statistical differences observed between anterior and circumferential reconstruction for subtotal spondylectomy. Anterior instrumentation alone for total spondylectomy did not restore stiffness to the intact level, and demonstrated significantly lower stiffness than that of circumferential reconstruction. For corpectomy or subtotal spondylectomy, anterior reconstruction alone can provide stiffness equivalent to circumferential reconstruction. However, total spondylectomy significantly reduces the anterior reconstruction stiffness, suggesting the need for combined anterior and posterior procedures."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

Although relatively uncommon, perioperative neurologic injury, in particular spinal cord injury, is one of the most feared complications of spinal surgery. Intraoperative neuromonitoring (IOM) has been proposed as a method which could reduce perioperative neurologic complications after spine surgery. A systematic review of the English language literature was undertaken for articles published between 1990 and March 2009. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Collaborative Library databases were searched, as were the reference lists of published articles examining the use of IOM in spine surgery. Two independent reviewers assessed the level of evidence quality using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. A total of 103 articles were initially screened and 32 ultimately met the predetermined inclusion criteria. We determined that there is a high level of evidence that multimodal IOM is sensitive and specific for detecting intraoperative neurologic injury during spine surgery. There is a low level of evidence that IOM reduces the rate of new or worsened perioperative neurologic deficits. There is very low evidence that an intraoperative response to a neuromonitoring alert reduces the rate of perioperative neurologic deterioration. Based on strong evidence that multimodality intraoperative neuromonitoring (MIOM) is sensitive and specific for detecting intraoperative neurologic injury during spine surgery, it is recommended that the use of MIOM be considered in spine surgery where the spinal cord or nerve roots are deemed to be at risk, including procedures involving deformity correction and procedures that require the placement of instrumentation. There is a need to develop evidence-based protocols to deal with intraoperative changes in MIOM and to validate these prospectively."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

The aim of this study was to evaluate soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) efficacy, as it is highly sensitive and specific and usually utilized in sport medicine for monitoring iron metabolism. sTfR was studied using two immunological methods (IDeA Orion, and Biokit) on a group of professional athletes, together with hematological and iron metabolism parameters. Values have been compared with those of sedentary people, before and during competitive season. Athletes were 76 professional male soccer players plus 20 males and 14 females of the alpine ski Italian National Teams. The sTfR values in athletes are similar to those found in sedentary people. Different results have been observed between the two different methods: a bias of 0.37 mg/L was found comparing them. A significant correlation between sTfR and iron, transferrin saturation, and reticulocytes was found in skiers; there was no correlation with hemoglobin, erythrocytes, ferritin. In soccer players significant differences have been retrieved among different teams' distribution of data. The principal limit for using sTfR in sports medicine, but also in the general population, is the lack of standardization among methods. The quantitative differences in athletes between the two methods are high, although the behavior of the parameter is similar from the quality point of view.

Multilevel analyses of quantitative data on the determinants of collaborations according to the DISC model were done, with 90 respondents (response 57 %) at pretest and 69 respondents (52 %) at posttest. Nvivo analyses of the qualitative data collected during the trajectory included minutes of monthly/bimonthly personal/telephone interviews (N = 65) with regional coordinators, and documents they produced about their activities. Quantitative data showed major improvements in change management and project management. There were also improvements in consensus development, commitment formation, formalization of the CSHP, and alignment of policies, although organizational problems within the collaboration increased. Content analyses of qualitative data identified five main management styles, including (1) facilitating active involvement of relevant parties; (2) informing collaborating parties; (3) controlling and (4) supporting their task accomplishment; and (5) coordinating the collaborative processes. We have contributed to the fundamental understanding of the development of intersectoral collaboration by combining qualitative and quantitative data. Our results support a systematic approach to intersectoral collaboration using the DISC model.

Using Iowa Trauma Registry data collected by the Iowa Department of Public Health, we examined trends in non-fatal agricultural injuries reported by acute care hospitals accredited as Level I, II, and III Trauma Care Facilities from 2005 to 2013. Rate ratios and corresponding 95\u00a0% confidence intervals were used to examine the burden of non-fatal agricultural injuries across this period. Negative binomial regression was used to calculate the average annual change in agricultural injury rates over time. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to examine the average annual change in the number of injuries over time. Between 2005 and 2013, a total of 1238 agricultural injuries were reported to the trauma registry by Level I, II and III trauma facilities. From 2005 to 2013, the rate of agricultural injuries per 100,000 hired workers, ranchers, and farm operators increased by 11\u00a0% for every unit increase in year and had nearly tripled over this time period. From 2005 to 2008 there was a significant annual increase of 31.74\u00a0% in the number of agricultural injuries whereas from 2008 to 2013 there was a non-significant annual increase of 3.70\u00a0%. The number of moderate and severe/critical injuries increased steadily and significantly over the study period, with annual percent increases of 13 and 20\u00a0%, respectively. Non-fatal agricultural injuries are rising, although the documented increases could be influenced in some part by treatment patterns in the trauma system, reporting bias or increases in farm work exposure. However, these issues do not likely account for all of the increase found, and this calls for an increase in priority of agricultural safety programs.

Fractionation of the cytoplasmic fraction was performed using sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and individual fractions were subjected in parallel to (i) identification of constituent proteins by mass spectrometry and (ii) structural visualization by electron microscopy. Macromolecular assemblies present in the fractions were analyzed by integrating available data using bioinformatic approaches. We identified 368 unique proteins in our sample. Among these are components of some well-characterized assemblies involved in diverse cellular processes and structures including translation, proteolysis, protein folding, metabolism, and the cytoskeleton, as well as less characterized proteins that may correspond to additional components of known assemblies or other homo- or hetero-oligomeric structures. Single-particle analysis of electron micrographs of negatively stained samples allowed the identification of clearly distinguishable two-dimensional projections of discrete protein assemblies. Among these, we can identify small ribosomal subunits and preribosomal particles, the 26S proteasome complex and small ringlike structures resembling the molecular chaperone complexes. In addition, a broad range of discrete and different complexes were seen at size ranges between 11 to 38 nm in diameter. Our procedure selects the assemblies on the basis of abundance and ease of isolation, and therefore provides an immediately useful starting point for further study of structure and function of large assemblies. Our results will also contribute toward building a molecular cell atlas."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

So far, only phenomenological approaches have been described, which do not capture the shear induced microstructural deformation, which is responsible for the viscoelastic behavior to the superimposed flow. Experimentally there are indications that there is a fundamental difference between the viscoelastic response to an orthogonally and a parallel superimposed shear flow. We present theoretical predictions, based on microscopic considerations, for both orthogonal and parallel viscoelastic response functions for a colloidal system of attractive particles near their gas-liquid critical point. These predictions extend to values of the stationary shear rate where the system is nonlinearly perturbed, and are based on considerations on the colloidal particle level. The difference in response to orthogonal and parallel superimposed shear flow can be understood entirely in terms of microstructural distortion, where the anisotropy of the microstructure under shear flow conditions is essential. In accordance with experimental observations we find pronounced negative values for response functions in case of parallel superposition for an intermediate range of frequencies, provided that microstructure is nonlinearly perturbed by the stationary shear component. For the critical colloidal systems considered here, the Kramers-Kronig relations for the superimposed response functions are found to be valid. It is argued, however, that the Kramers-Kronig relations may be violated for systems where the stationary shear flow induces a considerable amount of new microstructure."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

By limiting the retina's blue light exposure, new blue-light filtering intraocular lenses (BLF IOLs) have the potential to reduce the development of AMD following cataract surgery. In the current economic healthcare environment, there is increased interest in the cost impact of new medical technologies. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the cost impact of a BLF IOL versus a non-BLF IOL in cataract surgery. An economic model was developed to emulate three age-specific cohorts and to assess the clinical and economic outcomes over 5 years. Data from the published literature was supplemented with clinical expert opinion. Key literature inputs involved the risk of AMD after cataract surgery as well as laboratory and animal data on the effectiveness of the BLF IOL in reducing the risk of AMD. Clinical experts provided information on the management of AMD. Direct medical costs including the cost of the IOL, monitoring, and AMD prophylaxis and treatment were incorporated into the model. All costs were standardized to 2004 US dollars. In the BLF IOL group, the 5-year age-stratified incidence of AMD ranged from 0.58 to 9.23 per 100 eyes, compared with 1.69 to 24.55 per 100 eyes in the non-BLF IOL group. The incremental cost of the BLF was offset by reduced costs associated with averted AMD treatment. Estimated savings with BLF IOLs per 100 eyes were $4275, $29 997, and $111 734 in the 55 to 64 year-old, 65 to 74 year-old, and >or= 75-year-old cohorts, respectively; these findings remained robust throughout the sensitivity analyses. Limitations of this analysis include the lack of prospective clinical trial data that definitively demonstrate the efficacy of a BLF IOL in preventing AMD. Moreover, the efficacy data used to populate the model were derived from laboratory and animal studies. Thus, based on preliminary data, this study suggests that the economic benefits of implanting BLF IOLs during cataract surgery are observed in all patients over a 5-year timeframe although cost savings are greatest in patients >or= 75 years."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

These evidences suggest that lactoferrin plays a critical role during neurodegenerative diseases, although Lf-mediated iron transport across blood-brain barrier (BBB) is negligible compared to that of transferrin in normal condition. However, the kinetics of lactoferrins and lactoferrin-mediated iron transport are still unknown. To determine the kinetic rate constants of lactoferrin-mediated iron transport through BBB, a mass-action based ordinary differential equation model has been presented. A Bayesian framework is developed to estimate the kinetic rate parameters from posterior probability density functions. The iron transport across BBB is studied by considering both Lf- and Tf-mediated pathways for both normal and pathologic conditions. Using the point estimates of kinetic parameters, our model can effectively reproduce the experimental data of iron transport through BBB endothelial cells. The robustness of the model and parameter estimation process are further verified by perturbation of kinetic parameters. Our results show that surge in high-affinity receptor density increases lactoferrin as well as iron in the brain. Due to the lack of a feedback loop such as iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) for lactoferrin, iron can transport to the brain continuously, which might increase brain iron to pathological levels and can contribute to neurodegeneration. This study provides an improved understanding of presence of lactoferrin and iron in the brain during neurodegenerative diseases."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

The accuracy of these biological phenomena depend on genetic codes and all subsequent processes. To computerize the biological procedures, different domain experts are provided with the authorized access of the genetic codes; as a consequence, the ownership protection of such data is inevitable. For this purpose, watermarks serve as the proof of ownership of data. While protecting data, embedded hidden messages (watermarks) influence the genetic data; therefore, the accurate execution of the relevant processes and the overall result becomes questionable. Most of the DNA based watermarking techniques modify the genetic data and are therefore vulnerable to information loss. Distortion-free techniques make sure that no modifications occur during watermarking; however, they are fragile to malicious attacks and therefore cannot be used for ownership protection (particularly, in presence of a threat model). Therefore, there is a need for a technique that must be robust and should also prevent unwanted modifications. In this spirit, a watermarking technique with aforementioned characteristics has been proposed in this paper. The proposed technique makes sure that: (i) the ownership rights are protected by means of a robust watermark; and (ii) the integrity of genetic data is preserved. The proposed technique-GenInfoGuard-ensures its robustness through the \"watermark encoding\" in permuted values, and exhibits high decoding accuracy against various malicious attacks."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

We found that internalized AT(1A)R was retained in Rab5a-positive early endosomes and was neither targeted to lysosomes nor recycled back to the cell surface, whereas a mutant defective in Rab5a binding, AT(1A)R-(1-349), was targeted to lysosomes for degradation. However, the loss of Rab5a binding to the AT(1A)R carboxyl-terminal tail did not promote AT(1A)R recycling. Rather, it was the stable binding of beta-arrestin to the AT(1A)R that prevented, at least in part, AT(1A)R recycling. The overexpression of wild-type Rab7 and Rab7-Q67L resulted in both increased AT(1A)R degradation and AT(1A)R targeting to lysosomes. The Rab7 expression-dependent transition of \"putative\" AT(1A)R.beta-arrestin complexes to late endosomes was blocked by the expression of dominant-negative Rab5a-S34N. Rab11 overexpression established AT(1A)R recycling and promoted the redistribution of AT(1A)R.beta-arrestin complexes from early to recycling endosomes. Taken together, our data suggest that Rab5, Rab7, and Rab11 work in concert with one another to regulate the intracellular trafficking patterns of the AT(1A)R."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

Previous studies report that both ripple (100-250 Hz) and fast ripple (250-500 Hz) oscillations are increased in the seizure-onset zone of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Comparatively little is known, however, about their spatial distribution with respect to seizure-onset zone in neocortical epilepsy, or their prevalence in normal brain. We present a quantitative analysis of high-frequency oscillations and their rates of occurrence in a group of nine patients with neocortical epilepsy and two control patients with no history of seizures. Oscillations were automatically detected and classified using an unsupervised approach in a data set of unprecedented volume in epilepsy research, over 12 terabytes of continuous long-term micro- and macro-electrode intracranial recordings, without human preprocessing, enabling selection-bias-free estimates of oscillation rates. Hz is increased in the seizure-onset zone more frequently than a cluster of fast ripple frequency oscillations (median spectral centroid = 305 Hz); (ii) we found no difference in the rates of high frequency oscillations in control neocortex and the non-seizure-onset zone neocortex of patients with epilepsy, despite the possibility of different underlying mechanisms of generation; and (iii) while previous studies have demonstrated that oscillations recorded by parenchyma-penetrating micro-electrodes have higher peak 100-500 Hz frequencies than penetrating macro-electrodes, this was not found for the epipial electrodes used here to record from the neocortical surface. We conclude that the relative rate of ripple frequency oscillations is a potential biomarker for epileptic neocortex, but that larger prospective studies correlating high-frequency oscillations rates with seizure-onset zone, resected tissue and surgical outcome are required to determine the true predictive value."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

In this review we report data from non-clinical pharmacology studies supporting Nanolithium efficacy and the mechanism of action in Alzheimer's disease.

These data supported the initiation of a currently ongoing phase II proof-of-concept study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Nanolithium in patients with mild-to-severe Alzheimer's disease.

A potential component of FAS-II, the protein MabA (FabG1), was overexpressed and purified. Sedimentation equilibrium analyses revealed that MabA undergoes a dimer to tetramer self-association with a dissociation constant of 22 microM. The protein was detected by Western blotting in a mycobacterial cell-wall extract that produces mycolic acids and in the FPLC FAS-II fraction. MabA was shown to catalyse the NADPH-specific reduction of beta-ketoacyl derivatives, equivalent to the second step of a FAS-II elongation round. Unlike the known homologous proteins, MabA preferentially metabolizes long-chain substrates (C(8)-C(20)) and has a poor affinity for the C(4) substrate, in agreement with FAS-II specificities. Molecular modelling of MabA structure suggested the presence of an unusually hydrophobic substrate-binding pocket holding a unique Trp residue, suitable for fluorescence spectroscopic analyses. In agreement with the enzyme kinetic data, the spectral properties of MabA were different in the presence of the C(8)-C(16) ligands as compared to the C(4) ligand. Altogether, these data bring out distinctive enzymic and structural properties of MabA, which correlate with its predilection for long-chain substrates, in contrast to most of the other known ketoacyl reductases."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

However, most of the pathways responsible for RA effects remain unknown. To investigate such pathways, we used a RA-induced differentiation model in the human neuroblastoma cells, SH-SY5Y. Our data showed that n-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) reduced cells' proliferation rate and increased cells' sensitivity to RA toxicity. Simultaneously, NAC pre-incubation attenuated nuclear factor erythroid 2-like factor 2 (NRF2) activation by RA. None of these effects were obtained with Trolox\u00ae as antioxidant, suggesting a cysteine signalization by RA. NRF2 knockdown increased cell sensibility to RA after 96\u00a0h of treatment and diminished neuroblastoma proliferation rate. Conversely, NRF2 overexpression limited RA anti-proliferative effects and increased cell proliferation. In addition, a rapid and non-genomic activation of the ERK 1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways revealed to be equally required to promote NRF2 activation and necessary for RA-induced differentiation. Together, we provide data correlating NRF2 activity with neuroblastoma proliferation and resistance to RA treatments; thus, this pathway could be a potential target to optimize neuroblastoma chemotherapeutic response as well as in vitro neuronal differentiation protocols."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

Carbon quantum dots (CQDs), sourced from Na-citrate as a carbon precursor were synthesized and characterized before being tested for their ability to intervene in amyloidogenic (fibril-forming) trajectories. Hen-egg white lysozyme (HEWL) served as a model amyloidogenic protein. A pulse-chase lysozyme fibril-forming assay developed to examine the impact of CQDs on the HEWL amyloid-fibril-forming trajectory used ThT fluorescence as a reporter of mature fibril presence. The results revealed that the Na-citrate-derived CQDs were able to intervene at multiple points along the fibril-forming trajectory by preventing the conversion of both monomeric and oligomeric HEWL intermediates into mature fibrils. In addition, and importantly, the carbon nano material (CNM) was able to dissolve oligomeric HEWL into monomeric HEWL and provoke the disaggregation of mature HEWL fibrils. These results suggest that Na-citrate CQD's intervene in amyloidogenesis by multiple mechanisms. The gathered data, coupled with cell-line results demonstrating the relatively low cytotoxicity of Na-citrate CQDs, suggest that this emerging CNM has the potential to intervene both prophylactically and therapeutically in protein misfolding diseases. The aforementioned findings are likely to enable Na-citrate CQDs to eventually transition to both cell-line and preclinical models of protein-misfolding-related disorders. Importantly, the study outcomes positions Na-citrate CQDs as an important class of chemical, nanotechnological, and biobased interventional tools in neuroscience."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

SP afflicts ~20% of people, and is also one of the typical symptoms in narcolepsy. During SP the sleeper may experience hallucinations. Unsurprisingly, SP is associated with great fear globally. To date, there are no published clinical trials or outcome data for treating this condition. However, few non-pharmacological interventions have been proposed, including cognitive behavioral approaches, and case studies showing clinical amelioration with auto-hypnosis and Meditation-Relaxation (MR) therapy. The latter for instance showed positive preliminary results; when applied for 8 weeks it reduced SP frequency and anxiety/worry symptoms. With this paper we aimed to evaluate, with a small-scale pilot study, the efficacy of MR therapy for SP in patients with narcolepsy. Ten patients with narcolepsy and SP were enrolled in the study. Notably, MR therapy (n = 6), applied for 8 weeks, resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of days SP occurred (50% reduction); and the total number of SP episodes (54% reduction) in the last month of the study (demonstrated by large within-group effect sizes); unlike the control intervention (deep breathing) (n = 4). These findings are preliminary and exploratory given the small sample. Nonetheless, they represent the first proof of concept at providing empirically-guided insights into the possible efficacy of a novel treatment for frequently occurring SP. Although the study was conducted in patients with narcolepsy we cautiously suggest that the findings may generalize to individuals with isolated SP."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

The parameters describing the phase II kinetics are investigated by applying different data treatments to the acquired O2 uptake data to reduce the effects of their noise before running a non-linear regression procedure. The effects of different data treatments (nothing, resampling at various time intervals or averaging of more repetitions) on the precision and/or accuracy of the kinetics parameters estimated by non-linear regression with a simple mono-exponential model were investigated by artificially generating 10(5) simulated responses with average breath duration of 3.5 s. The simulations showed that, whatever the explored data treatment, the average estimated parameters were close to the theoretical ones. Nevertheless, in all the explored conditions, the non-linear regression provided narrower asymptotic confidence intervals than the real ones. In particular, when the responses were resampled at 1 s time intervals, the width of the asymptotic confidence interval for the time constant was 50% of the real one, even after the averaging of more repetitions. The reasons for this discrepancy were investigated further, allowing us to identify some methods to obtain the correct confidence interval of the O2 uptake kinetics parameters. The simplest method to obtain an asymptotic confidence interval close to the real one is to average more responses resampled to a time interval slightly longer than the average breath duration."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

Increasing data have shown substantial differences between the receptor profiles of primary BCs and their paired metastases. In this study, we provide a large single center cohort to assess the frequency of receptor conversion in metastatic BC. The overall discordant rates were 18.3%, 40.3%, and 13.7% for ER, PR, and HER2, respectively. The discordance was significantly higher for PR when compared with ER and HER2. The conversion occurred significantly as a switch from positive to negative receptor status when compared with that from negative to positive for all three receptors. Semiquantitative analyses revealed a significantly decreased expression of both ER (25%) and PR (57%) in the metastases. There was a higher rate of PR discordance in bone metastases when comparing to other common organs of relapse. Furthermore, in the subset of patients with a single primary and multiple distant metastases, the discordant rates among the distant sites were 27.5%, 39.4%, and 14.3% for ER, PR, and HER2, respectively. A positive ER status, be it in primary or metastatic BC, was associated with a prolonged metastasis-free survival when compared with ER-negative primary tumors without conversion. Furthermore, a positive ER status in metastatic BC regardless of primary was associated with a superior overall survival when compared with an ER-negative tumor without conversion. Thus, receptor conversion is a frequent event in the course of BC progression, and can also be seen between different metastatic sites. Moreover, some conversions are of prognostic significance. The findings may reflect tumor heterogeneity, sampling or treatment effect, but may also indicate alteration in tumor biology.

A comprehensive search for relevant studies published between January 1, 1951 and May 14, 2020 was conducted in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Web of Science, and EMbase. Two investigators independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the included studies. The software Endnote X9 was used for screening articles, and the Review Manager 5.3 for analyzing data. The meta-analyses involved 6 studies and 1457 individuals. The pooled results favored the EA group for the increase of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week in the fourth week (MD = 0.80, P = 0.001) during treatment, and further improved in the eight weeks (MD = 1.25, P < 0.001). During the follow-up period, significant changes in CSBMs per week were seen in the experimental group (MD = 1.38, P = 0.008); the effect decreased in the twelfth week (MD = 0.87, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the Bristol stool scale score between the two groups in the fourth week (MD = 0.40, P = 0.08), but significant differences were observed in the eighth week (MD = 0.40, P = 0.03). A significant reduction in patient assessment of constipation quality of life (PAC-QOL) score were observed in the EA group during treatment (SMD = -0.83, P < 0.001). No serious adverse events were reported. EA had favorable effects on CSFC, and the longer the treatment duration was, the better was the effect, but the effect showed a certain period of validity. However, the results may be influenced by the clinical heterogeneity of acupuncture points, depth of needling, intensity, and frequency of EA."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

The application of these approaches is usually feasible and effective when performed by healthcare professionals with specific expertise and skills and when data and resources are easily accessible. Contrariwise, in the field situation where healthcare workers or first responders from heterogeneous competences can be asked to investigate an outbreak of unknown origin, a simple and suitable tool for rapid agent identification and appropriate outbreak management is highly needed. Most especially when time is limited, available data are incomplete, and accessible infrastructure and resources are inadequate. The use of a prompt, user-friendly, and accessible tool able to rapidly recognize an infectious disease outbreak and with high sensitivity and precision may be a game-changer to support emergency response and public health investigations. This paper presents the work performed to implement and test an innovative tool for prompt identification of infectious diseases during outbreaks, called Infectious Diseases Seeker (IDS). IDS is a standalone software that runs on the most common operative systems. It has been built by integrating a database containing an interim set of 60 different disease causative agents and COVID-19 data and is able to work in an off-line mode without requiring a network connection. IDS has been applied in a real and complex scenario in terms of concomitant infectious diseases (yellow fever, COVID-19, and Lassa fever), as can be in the second part of 2020 in Nigeria. The outcomes have allowed inferring that yellow fever (YF), and not Lassa fever, was affecting the area under investigation. Our result suggests that a tool like IDS could be valuable for the quick and easy identification and discrimination of infectious disease outbreaks even when concurrent outbreaks occur, like for the case study of YF and COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

Epistasis is an important genetic foundation underlying quantitative traits in many organisms as well as in complex human diseases. However, there are two major barriers in identifying epistasis using large genomic datasets. One is that epistasis analysis will induce over-fitting of an over-saturated model with the high-dimensionality of a genomic dataset. Therefore, the problem of identifying epistasis demands efficient statistical methods. The second barrier comes from the intensive computing time for epistasis analysis, even when the appropriate model and data are specified. In this study, we combine statistical techniques and computational techniques to scale up epistasis analysis using Empirical Bayesian Elastic Net (EBEN) models. Specifically, we first apply a matrix manipulation strategy for pre-computing the correlation matrix and pre-filter to narrow down the search space for epistasis analysis. We then develop a parallelized approach to further accelerate the modeling process. Our experiments on synthetic and empirical genomic data demonstrate that our parallelized methods offer tens of fold speed up in comparison with the classical EBEN method which runs in a sequential manner. We applied our parallelized approach to a yeast dataset, and we were able to identify both main and epistatic effects of genetic variants associated with traits such as fitness.

Recent neuroimaging studies suggest that ASD disrupts the structural and functional organization of brain networks and, presumably, how they generate information.

We recorded magnetoencephalography while children with ASD and typically developing controls performed a set-shifting task designed to test mental flexibility. We used multiscale entropy (MSE) to estimate the rate at which information was generated in a set of sources distributed across the brain. Multivariate partial least-squares analysis revealed 2 distributed networks, operating at fast and slow time scales, that respond completely differently to set shifting in ASD compared with control children, indicating disrupted temporal organization within these networks. Moreover, when typically developing children engaged these networks, they achieved faster reaction times. When children with ASD engaged these networks, there was no improvement in performance, suggesting that the networks were ineffective in children with ASD. Our data demonstrate that the coordination and temporal organization of large-scale neural assemblies during the performance of cognitive control tasks is disrupted in children with ASD, contributing to executive function deficits in this group."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

In this study, we investigated the mechanism for Stat3 nuclear transport. We report here that among five ubiquitously expressed human importin alphas, importin alpha5 and alpha7, but not importin alpha1, alpha3, and alpha4, bind to Stat3 upon cytokine stimulation. Similar results were observed for Stat1, but not for Stat5a and 5b, which were unable to interact with any of the importin alphas. The C-terminus of importin alpha5 is necessary but not sufficient for Stat3 binding. Truncation mutant of Stat3 (aa1-320) that contains Arg214/215 exhibits specific binding to importin alpha5, and an exclusive nuclear localization. Point mutations of Arg214/215 in this mutant destroy importin alpha5 binding and its nuclear localization. In contrast, the truncation mutant (aa320-770) including Arg414/417 fails to interact with importin alpha5 and is localized in the cytoplasm. However, both sequence elements are necessary for the full-length Stat3's interaction with importin alpha5. These results suggest that Arg214/215 is likely the binding site for importin alpha5, whereas Arg414/417 may not be involved in the direct binding, but necessary for maintaining the proper conformation of Stat3 dimer for importin binding.

Structural equation twin modeling was applied to interview and questionnaire data on personality traits and lifetime psychiatric disorders on more than 5300 members of male-male (MM) and female-female (FF) twin pairs. The best-fitting models for both the externalizing and internalizing spectra differed significantly in males and females. In males, the externalizing genetic common factor was best indexed by four disorders in the following order: antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), drug abuse/dependence (DAD), alcohol abuse dependence (AAD) and conduct disorder (CD). In females, the four disorders most closely related to the externalizing common factor were, in order: DAD, AAD, nicotine dependence (ND) and ASPD. Personality traits of novelty seeking (NS) and extraversion (E) better indexed the genetic externalizing spectrum in females than in males. In both males and females, major depression (MD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) best indexed the genetic internalizing common factor. Panic disorder (PD) and agoraphobia (AgP) better reflected the internalizing genetic common factor in women, and neuroticism (N) in men. Genetic correlations between the two spectra were estimated at + 0.53 in males and + 0.52 in females. The disorders that optimally index the genetic liability to externalizing and internalizing disorders in the general population differ meaningfully in men and women. In both sexes, these genetic spectra are better assessed by psychiatric disorders than by personality traits."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

In DIC, excessive thrombin generation causes symptoms from formation of microthrombi to multiorgan failure; bleeding risks can also be a concern because of clotting factor consumption. Different clinical events lead to DIC, including sepsis, trauma, and shock. Treatments for thrombotic episodes or bleeding presentation in DIC oppose each other, thus creating therapeutic dilemmas in management. The objective of this study was to develop fibrin-specific core-shell nanogels (FSNs) loaded with tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) to treat the microcirculatory complications of DIC, which would facilitate targeted clot dissolution to manage microthrombi and the potential consumptive coagulopathy that causes bleeding. FSNs enhance formation of actively polymerizing clots by crosslinking fibrin fibers, but they can also target preexisting microthrombi and, when loaded with tPA, facilitate targeted delivery to lyse the microthrombi. We hypothesized that this dual action would simultaneously address bleeding and microthrombi with DIC to improve outcomes. In vivo, tPA-FSNs decreased the presentation of multiorgan microthrombi, recovered platelet counts, and improved bleeding outcomes in a DIC rodent model. When incorporated with human DIC patient plasma, tPA-FSNs restored clot structure and clot growth under flow. Together, these data demonstrate that a fibrinolytic agent loaded into fibrin-targeting nanogels could improve DIC outcomes."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

Both areas were chosen because they have different patterns and features, such as different residential densities, street aspect ratios and orientations, impervious surfaces, vegetation, and elevations. The aim is to assess the effect of the different patterns of these settlements on the land surface temperature (LST) using Landsat 8 satellite images in the summertime, July 19, 2021. The results showed that the maximum, minimum, and average LST of the Do\u011fukent Neighborhood, which is characterized by uniform streets with dense vegetation and streets oriented to the NE-SW or NW-SE, were recorded as 44.4, 38.4, and 41.0\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively, while 45.4, 40.4, and 43.8\u00a0\u00b0C were recorded in the \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131 Neighborhood characterized by excessive residential areas and deep streets with lack of vegetation oriented to the E-W direction. However, the average difference is around 2.8\u00a0\u00b0C, implying that residential areas with mid-building heights and vegetated streets oriented to NE-SW or NW-SE are thermally better than those with high aspect ratio streets and lacking vegetation and oriented to E-W. It was found that small variations in land elevation of these areas do not significantly affect the LST. The results of this study will set an example not only for the city of Elaz\u0131\u011f, but also for the determination of urban transformation areas, new housing areas, and climate change in most cities of Turkey and other countries, and will provide support for sustainable and more livable urbanization in most cities.

Specifically, SI2DL simultaneously learns an intravideo distance metric and an inter-video distance metric from the training videos. The intra-video distance metric is used to make each video more compact, and the inter-video one is used to ensure that the distance between truly matching videos is smaller than that between wrong matching videos. Considering that the goal of distance learning is to make truly matching video pairs from different persons be well separated with each other, we also propose a pair separation based SI2DL (P-SI2DL). P-SI2DL aims to learn a pair of distance metrics, under which any two truly matching video pairs can be well separated. Experiments on four public pedestrian image sequence datasets show that our approaches achieve the state-of-the-art performance."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

In the early phase of unilateral antigen-induced arthritis, there was a particularly close correlation between R-L difference values and clinical scores of inflammation, reflecting an acute type of inflammation. Data obtained after the early phase of arthritis suggested that R-L difference measurements provide a more sensitive measure of inflammation than clinical scores. 99mTcO4 uptake measurements can reliably be used to detect and quantitate joint inflammation in animals as small as rabbits."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

Vitamin B12 and folate are micronutrients that are utilized in this pathway and their deficiency can result in the perturbation of one-carbon metabolism and subsequent perturbations in DNA replication and repair. This effect has been well characterized in nuclear DNA but to date, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has not been investigated extensively. Mitochondrial variants have been associated with several inherited and age-related disease states; therefore, the study of factors that impact heteroplasmy are important for advancing our understanding of the mitochondrial genome's impact on human health. Heteroplasmy studies require robust and efficient mitochondrial DNA enrichment to carry out in-depth mtDNA sequencing. Many of the current methods for mtDNA enrichment can introduce biases and false-positive results. Here, we use a method that overcomes these limitations and have applied it to assess mitochondrial heteroplasmy in mouse models of altered one-carbon metabolism. Vitamin B12 deficiency was found to cause increased levels of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy across all tissues that were investigated. Folic acid supplementation also contributed to elevated mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy across all mouse tissues investigated. Heteroplasmy analysis of human data from the Framingham Heart Study suggested a potential sex-specific effect of folate and vitamin B12 status on mitochondrial heteroplasmy. This is a novel relationship that may have broader consequences for our understanding of one-carbon metabolism, mitochondrial-related disease and the influence of nutrients on DNA mutation rates."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

Phylogenetic Community Structure (PCS) is increasingly used in community assembly studies to incorporate evolutionary perspectives and as a proxy for trait (dis)similarity within communities. Studies often assume a stationary relationship between PCS and climate, though few studies have tested this assumption over long time periods with concurrent community data. We estimated two PCS metrics-Nearest Taxon Index (NTI) and Net Relatedness index (NRI)-of fossil pollen assemblages of Angiosperms in eastern North America over the last 21 ka BP at 1 ka intervals. We analyzed spatiotemporal relationships between PCS and seven climate variables, evaluated the potential impact of deglaciation on PCS, and tested for the stability of climate-PCS relationships through time. The broad scale geographic patterns of PCS remained largely stable across time, with overdispersion tending to be most prominent in the central and southern portion of the study area and clustering dominating at the longitudinal extremes. Most importantly, we found that significant relationships between climate variables and PCS (slope) were not constant as climate changed during the last deglaciation and new ice-free regions were colonized. We also found weak, but significant relationships between both PCS metrics (i.e., NTI and NRI) and climate and time-since-deglaciation that also varied through time. Overall, our results suggest that (1) PCS of fossil Angiosperm assemblages during the last 21ka BP have had largely constant spatial patterns, but (2) temporal variability in the relationships between PCS and climate brings into question their usefulness in predictive modeling of community assembly."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}

However, these data are often missing key variables, increasing the chance of finding spurious causal relationships due to confounding. While methods exist for causal inference with latent variables in static cases, temporal relationships are more challenging, as varying time lags make latent causes more difficult to uncover and approaches often have significantly higher computational complexity. To address this, we make the key observation that while a variable may be latent in one dataset, it may be observed in another, or we may have domain knowledge about its effects. We propose a computationally efficient method that overcomes latent variables by using prior knowledge to reconstruct data for unobserved variables, while remaining robust to cases when the knowledge is wrong or does not apply. On simulated data, our approach outperforms the state of the art with a lower false discovery rate for causal inference. On real-world data from individuals with Type 1 diabetes, we show that our approach can discover causal relationships involving unmeasured meals and exercise."}], "max_tokens": 16000}}
