African Americans (AA) are 1.8 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than non-Hispanic Whites.
This increased diabetes risk has been linked to high rates of obesity and poor dietary habits; therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify how the nutrient intake profiles of AA adults differ by diabetes status.
Dietary intakes of AA adults (aged > or =18 years; n=2,589) were examined from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
Individuals were stratified into three groups (normoglycemia, pre-diabetes, and diabetes) based on self-reported previous diagnosis, blood glucose and use of glucose-lowering medications.
Dietary intakes were collected using 24-hour recalls; energy-adjusted nutrients intake were compared across diabetes status.
Risk for pre-diabetes was 4% higher for every one year increase in age, while the risk for diabetes was 7% higher.
Those with diabetes consumed significantly less energy (P=.03) and significantly more energy-adjusted protein (P=.011) and dietary fiber (P<.001) compared to those with normal blood glucose.
Mean consumption of carbohydrates were nearly two and a half times the estimated average requirement regardless of diabetes status.
Individuals with diabetes had significantly higher intakes of several B-vitamins including thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate and B-6 compared to individuals who had normal blood glucose values.
This study identifies opportunities for improvement in the dietary habits of African Americans and supports the development of culturally-appropriate diabetes prevention and treatment strategies.
