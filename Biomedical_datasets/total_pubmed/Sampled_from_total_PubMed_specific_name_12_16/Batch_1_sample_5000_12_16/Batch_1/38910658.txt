Graves' disease (GD) is an autoimmune condition of the thyroid.
The hyperthyroidism manifested by patients affected by this disease is caused by the production of autoantibodies against the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, or thyrotropin) receptor (TSHR), which mimic the effects of the hormone on thyroid cells, thereby stimulating autonomic production of thyroxine and triiodothyronine.
Deciding on a therapeutic approach to this condition presents intricate dilemmas for both clinicians and patients.
Each of the three available treatment modalities is grounded in evidence-based medicine, affirming its efficacy.
This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the effect of carbimazole (CBM), radioactive iodine (RAI), and surgery in treating GD and provide evidence-based recommendations for healthcare providers regarding the optimal management of the condition based on a comprehensive analysis of effectiveness, safety, patient satisfaction, and recovery outcomes.
This systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
We used the PubMed and Google Scholar databases to conduct a thorough web search for articles published between January 2019 and September 2023.
The meta-analysis was carried out using Resource Manager (Revman) 5.4.1.
The study found that propylthiouracil (PTU) or methimazole/carbimazole (MMI/CBM) treatment increases the risk of hyperlipidemia in patients with hyperthyroidism.
Once in a euthyroid state, glucose tolerance increases; for children with GD, a computer model for customized dosing has been created.
To sum up, CBM, surgery, and RAI are all useful treatment options for GD.
Using steroids in conjunction with radiation therapy may help prevent Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO).
