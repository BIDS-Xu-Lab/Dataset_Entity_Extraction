Recent results from BOOMERANG-98 and MAXIMA-1, taken together with COBE DMR, provide consistent and high signal-to-noise measurements of the cosmic microwave background power spectrum at spherical harmonic multipole bands over 2<l less similar to 800.
Analysis of the combined data yields 68% (95%) confidence limits on the total density, Omega(tot) approximately 1.11+/-0.07 (+0.13)(-0.12), the baryon density, Omega(b)h(2) approximately 0.032(+0.005)(-0.004) (+0.009)(-0.008), and the scalar spectral tilt, n(s) approximately 1.01(+0.09)(-0.07) (+0.17)(-0.14).
These data are consistent with inflationary initial conditions for structure formation.
Taken together with other cosmological observations, they imply the existence of both nonbaryonic dark matter and dark energy in the Universe.
