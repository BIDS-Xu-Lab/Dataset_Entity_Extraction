Lymphatic flow is necessary for maintenance of vital physiological functions in humans and animals.
To carry out optimal lymphatic flow, adequate contractile activity of the lymphatic collectors is necessary.
Like in all body systems, aging has also an effect on the lymphatic system.
However, limited knowledge is available on how aging directly affects the lymphatic system anatomy, physiology and function.
We investigated how senescence leads to alterations in morphology and function of the lymphatic vessels.
We used the strategy of a review to summarize the scientific literature of studies that have been published in the area of lymphatic senescence.
Searches were carried out on PubMed and Web of Science using predefined search queries.
We obtained an initial set of 1060 publications.
They were filtered to 114 publications based on strict inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Finally, the most appropriate 57 studies that specifically addressed lymphatic senescence have been selected for the preparation of this review.
Analysis of the literature showed that lymphatic senescence is associated with alterations in lymphatic muscles and nerve fibers, lymphatic glycocalyx function of lymphatic endothelial cells, effects of chronic ultraviolet light exposure and oxidative stress as well as changes in lymphatic pump, acute inflammation responses and immune function.
The current review underscores the relevance of the understudied area of lymphatic senescence.
Continued research on the impact of aging on the structure and function of the lymphatic vasculature is needed to provide further insights to develop innovative clinical diagnostic-and treatment-modalities as well as to reduce the morbidity associated with diseases related to the lymphatic system.
