To describe the structure of the Spanish emergency medicine research network or networks, researchers' roles, and patterns of collaboration between hospitals.
The search for publications was carried out in the SCOPUS database for the 5-year period of 2010 to 2014.
We used network analysis software to map ties between researchers and hospitals that had established at least 5 and 10 relationships, respectively, during the period under study.
We calculated indicators of degree of centrality for individual scientists and hospitals and tabulated data for the main authors and centers.
We identified 2626 articles with 12 372 different authors at 1134 hospitals in 75 countries.
The largest number of international relations were with France, the United States, and the United Kingdom.
Authors had established 93 687 connections that allowed us to identify 23 collaborating groups, the largest of which was comprised of 30 individuals.
We also found 12 855 connections between hospitals that identified a single subnetwork of collaboration comprised of 19 hospitals, 1 of which was in Switzerland.
Measures of centrality, intermediation, and proximity led to classification of the most important members of author and hospital networks.
This analysis of research networks in emergency medicine has afforded the first details describing the relationships maintained by Spanish scientists and hospitals.
