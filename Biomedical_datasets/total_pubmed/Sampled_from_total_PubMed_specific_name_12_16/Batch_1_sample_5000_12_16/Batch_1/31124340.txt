Liver fibrosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and the outcome of various chronic liver diseases.
Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is the key event in liver fibrosis.
Studies have confirmed that miR-140-3p plays a potential regulatory effect on HSC activation.
However, whether miR-140-3p mediates the liver fibrosis remains unknown.
Expression of miR-140-3p was detected by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR).
Cell proliferation was measured by MTT, while cell apoptosis rate was determined via flow cytometry.
Western blot assay was used to detect the expression of cleaved PARP.
The fibrogenic effect was evaluated by expression of α-smooth muscle actin and desmin.
Functional experiments were performed in transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1)-induced HSC-T6 cells with transfection of anti-miR-140-3p and/or siPTEN.
Target binding between miR-140-3p and PTEN was predicted by the TargetScan database and identified using luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation.
TGF-β1 induced the activation of HSC-T6 cells, and miR-140-3p expression varied according to HSC-T6 cell activation status.
Knockdown of miR-140-3p reduced cell proliferation and the expressions of α-SMA and desmin, as well as increased apoptosis, in TGF-β1-induced HSC-T6 cells, which could be blocked by PTEN silencing.
Additionally, inactivation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway stimulated by miR-140-3p knockdown was abolished when silencing PTEN expression.
PTEN was negatively regulated by miR-140-3p via direct binding in HSC-T6 cells.
miR-140-3p is an important mediator in HSC-T6 cell activation, and miR-140-3p knockdown suppresses cell proliferation and fibrogenesis in TGF-β1-induced HSC-T6 cells, indicating that miR-140-3p may be a potential novel molecular target for liver fibrosis.
