Burn survivors undergoing complex glycemic derangements in the acute period after burn are at significantly increased risk of worse outcomes.
Although most critical care investigations recommend intensive glycemic control to prevent morbidity and mortality, conflicting recommendations exist.
To date, no literature review has studied outcomes associated with intensive glucose control in the burn intensive care unit (ICU) population.
This review addresses this gap to improve practice guidelines and support further research regarding glycemic control.
This is a narrative review of literature utilizing PubMed for articles published at any time.
Inclusion criteria were English studies describing glucose management in ICU adult burn patients.
Studies involving pediatric patients, non-human subjects, care non-ICU care, case reports, editorials, and position pieces were excluded.
Our literature search identified 2154 articles.
Full text review of 61 articles identified eight meeting inclusion criteria.
Two studies reported mortality benefit of intensive glucose control ( mg/dL) compared to controls ( mg/dL), while two studies showed no mortality differences.
Three studies reported reduced infectious complications such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, sepsis, and bacteremia.
A majority of the studies (6/8) reported higher risk for hypoglycemia with tight glucose control, but few reported instances of adverse sequela associated with hypoglycemia.
Intensive glucose control may provide benefit to burn patients, but complications associated with hypoglycemia must be considered.
This review recommends an individualized patient-centered approach factoring comorbidities, burn injury characteristics, and risk factors when determining whether to employ intensive glucose control.
