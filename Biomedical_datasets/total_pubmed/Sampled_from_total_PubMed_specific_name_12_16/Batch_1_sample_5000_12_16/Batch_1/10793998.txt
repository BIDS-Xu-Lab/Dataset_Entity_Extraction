Telemedicine is still in its infancy, but undergoing rapid development.
It is very difficult to evaluate telemedicine.
We performed a literature survey (Medline).
During the period 1990-8, over 1500 articles on telemedicine were published.
Of these, 246 mentioned economic aspects in the abstract (16%).
We selected 29 studies although few had demonstrated cost-effectiveness.
Benefits for the patients in the form of reduced travel and waiting time must often be weighed against increased provider costs.
Up to now, telemedicine in general has not had any significant effect on medical practice, or the structure and organization of health-care.
In order to utilize the potential of telemedicine, its integration with traditional health-care is very important.
There are country-specific variations in the health systems that make it difficult to generalize the results from one country to another.
