Background and Aims: The genetic risk score (GRS) is an important tool for estimating the total genetic contribution or susceptibility to a certain outcome of interest in an individual, taking into account their genetic risk alleles.
This study aims to systematically review the association between the GRS of low vitamin D with different noncommunicable diseases/markers.
Methods: The article was first registered in PROSPERO CRD42023406929.
PubMed and Embase were searched from the time of inception until March 2023 to capture all the literature related to the vitamin D genetic risk score (vD-GRS) in association with noncommunicable diseases.
Eleven eligible studies were included in this study.
Three studies reported a significant association between vD-GRS and metabolic parameters, including body fat percentage, body mass index, glycated hemoglobin, and fasting blood glucose.
Moreover, colorectal cancer overall mortality and the risk of developing arterial fibrillation were also found to be associated with genetically deprived vitamin D levels.
Conclusions: This systematic review highlights the genetic contribution of low-vitamin-D-risk single nucleotides polymorphisms (SNPs) as an accumulative factor associated with different non-communicable diseases/markers, including cancer mortality and the risk of developing obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases such as arterial fibrillation.
