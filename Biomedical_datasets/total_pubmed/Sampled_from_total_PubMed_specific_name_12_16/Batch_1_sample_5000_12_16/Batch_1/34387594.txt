Currently, there have been few studies on the function and molecular mechanism of miR-141-3p in the development of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC).
This study aimed to explore the relationship between miR-141-3p and NIMA (never in mitosis, gene A)-related kinase-6 (NEK6) and investigate the role of the interaction in CCRCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis.
Starbase database was used to predict the target gene of miR-141-3p in CCRCC and dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to verify the targeting relationship between miR-141-3p and the target gene.
Real-time quantitative PCR was conducted to detect the expression of miR-141-3p and NEK6 mRNA in cells.
Western blot was carried out to detect the protein level of NEK6 in cells.
Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, transwell assay and wound healing assay were conducted to detect CCRCC cell proliferation, invasion and migration abilities.
Flow cytometry was performed to detect CCRCC cell apoptosis.
miR-141-3p was markedly lowly expressed, and NEK6 was a target of miR-141-3p and was remarkably highly expressed in CCRCC cells.
Over-expressing miR-141-3p could inhibit CCRCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and promote apoptosis.
The inhibitory effect of miR-141-3p over-expression on cell proliferation, migration and invasion was significantly weakened by over-expressing NEK6.
miR-141-3p could regulate CCRCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis by targeting NEK6.
This study lays the basis for the exploration of the molecular mechanism underlying CCRCC pathogenesis and research on targeted therapies for CCRCC.
