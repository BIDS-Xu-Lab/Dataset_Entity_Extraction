The increasing complexity and scope of thoracic surgery warrants tools to monitor and improve the quality of surgical care provided to patients.
Few data on the volume or outcome of thoracic surgical procedures are currently collected in Australasia.
The Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand Thoracic Registry (ANZTHOR)
Steering Group have sought to rectify this by designing a REDCap-based thoracic clinical quality registry with improved patient care as its central goal.
This centralised thoracic registry will benefit patients, clinicians, trainees, and the practise of thoracic surgery in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand.
With time, the registry will also facilitate high quality thoracic research.
