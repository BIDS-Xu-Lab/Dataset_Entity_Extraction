Congenital anomalies (CAs) are a leading cause of neonatal death.
Many CAs can be diagnosed prenatally.
To estimate the prenatal detection rate (PDR) of CA in hospitals participating in the RENAC (National Network of Congenital Anomalies of Argentina) and to analyze the PDR according to different factors.
Sources were reports of RENAC from the 2013-2016 period.
Congenital anomalies included were those detectable by ultrasound or by a prenatal karyotype.
PDR was calculated by region, health subsector, clinical presentation, maternal age, sex, and twining.
Using multiple logistic regression analysis, we evaluated predictors of prenatal detection.
In total, 9976 cases were defined as prenatal detectable; 5021 were detected (PDR = 50.3%).
Multiple presentation increased the chances of prenatal detection (Adj. OR = 1.6; 95%CI 1.4-1.9).
Prenatal detection was lower in the public subsector (Adj. OR = 0.8; 95%CI 0.7-0.9) and in the northern regions of the country.
PDR was higher than 75% in isolated cases of urinary malformation, anencephaly, and gastroschisis.
Prenatal detection increased the chance of birth in higher complexity-level hospitals (Adj. OR = 2.5; 95%CI 2.3-2.8).
PDR was within the range previously reported.
Heterogeneity between regions and health subsector suggests the need for training to achieve equity in detection.
