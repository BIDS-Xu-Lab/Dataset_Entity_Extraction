The vast amount of information generated by the human genome sequencing project and related projects has given rise to a new paradigm in experimental biology.
This new paradigm invokes the experimentation and data analysis at genome-wide scales, as well as the generation of new technologies and resources that take full advantage of the available sequence information.
The Institute of Proteomics at Harvard Medical School is building a comprehensive, characterized, arrayed and flexible gene repository that will allow full exploitation of the genomic information by enabling functional genomics as well as protein expression, purification and analysis at genome wide scale.
The FLEXGene repository (Full Length EXpression-ready) will contain clones representing the complete set of open reading frames (ORFs) of different organisms including H. sapiens and several pathogens and model organisms.
The clones are constructed using recombination-based cloning technology so that hundreds or thousands of coding regions can be transferred into any expression vector in a parallel and timely mode, allowing the broadest variety of experiments to be carried out.
