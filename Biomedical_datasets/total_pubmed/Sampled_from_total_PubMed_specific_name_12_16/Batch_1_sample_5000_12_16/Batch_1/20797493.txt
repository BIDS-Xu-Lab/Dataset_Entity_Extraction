The purpose of this study was to test whether the association of C-reactive protein (CRP) with increased risk of atrial fibrillation is a robust and perhaps even causal association.
Elevated levels of CRP previously have been associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation.
We studied 10,276 individuals from the prospective Copenhagen City Heart Study, including 771 individuals who had atrial fibrillation during follow-up, and another 36,600 persons from the cross-sectional Copenhagen General Population Study, including 1,340 cases with atrial fibrillation.
Individuals were genotyped for 4 CRP gene polymorphisms and had high-sensitivity CRP levels measured.
[CI]: 1.54- to 3.10-fold) increased risk of atrial fibrillation.
Risk estimates attenuated slightly after multifactorial adjustment to 1.77 (95% CI: 1.22 to 2.55), and after additional adjustment for heart failure and plasma fibrinogen level to 1.47 (95% CI: 1.02 to 2.13) and 1.63 (95% CI: 1.21 to 2.20), respectively.
Genotype combinations of the 4 CRP polymorphisms associated with up to a 63% increase in plasma CRP levels (p < 0.001), but not with increased risk of atrial fibrillation.
[95% CI: 1.30 to 1.44]; p < 0.001).
Elevated plasma CRP robustly associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation; however, genetically elevated CRP levels did not.
This suggests that elevated plasma CRP per se does not increase atrial fibrillation risk.
