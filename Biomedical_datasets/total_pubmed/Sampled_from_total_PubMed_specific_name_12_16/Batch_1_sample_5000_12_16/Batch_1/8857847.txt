The objective of this study was to determine the trend of breast conservation surgery (BCS) in North Carolina over a 6-year period and to identify patient, hospital, and surgeon factors associated with the use of BCS.
Despite evidence that BCS is an appropriate method of treatment for early stage breast cancer, surgeons in the United States have been slow to adopt this treatment method.
Cases of primary breast cancer surgery in all 157 hospitals in the state from 1988 to 1993, inclusive (N = 20,760), were obtained from the State Medical Database Commission, Area Resource File, American Hospital Association and State Board of Medical Examiner's Databases.
Multiple logistic regression was used to generate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to determine factors associated with BCS.
The rate of BCS doubled from 7.3% in 1988 to 14.3% in 1993, with an overall rate of 10.2% (2117/ 20.760).
Multiple logistic regression identified the following factors associated with BCS: patient age younger than 50 years of age (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.4, 2.1), patient age 50 to 69 years of age (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.1, 1.4), private insurance (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.0, 1.4), hospital bed size 401+(OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.6, 2.5), bed size 101 to 400 (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.3, 2.1), and surgeon graduation from medical school since 1981 (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2, 2.0).
Rates of BCS in North Carolina are low.
Least likely to have BCS were women older than 70 years of age, without private insurance, treated at small hospitals by older surgeons.
To increase the use of BCS, widespread education of surgeons, other health care providers, policy makers, and the general public is warranted.
