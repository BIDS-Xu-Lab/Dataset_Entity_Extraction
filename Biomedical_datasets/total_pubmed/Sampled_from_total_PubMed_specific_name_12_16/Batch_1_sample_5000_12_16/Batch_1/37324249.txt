About one-fifth of patients with COVID-19 need to be hospitalized.
Predicting factors affecting the hospital length of stay (LOS) can be effective in prioritizing patients, planning for services, and preventing the increase in LOS and death of patients.
The present study aimed to identify the factors that predict LOS and mortality in COVID-19 patients in a retrospective cohort study.
A total of 27,859 patients were admitted to 22 hospitals from February 20, 2020 to June 21, 2021.
The data collected from 12,454 patients were screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
The data were captured from the MCMC (Medical Care Monitoring Center) database.
The study tracked patients until their hospital discharge or death.
Hospital LOS and mortality were assessed as the study outcomes.
As the results revealed, 50.8% of patients were male and 49.2% were female.
The mean hospital LOS of the discharged patients was 4.94.
Yet, 9.1% of the patients (n = 1133) died.
Among the predictors of mortality and long hospital LOS were the age above 60, admission to the ICU, coughs, respiratory distress, intubation, oxygen level less than 93%, cigarette and drug abuse, and a history of chronic diseases.
Masculinity, gastrointestinal symptoms, and cancer were the effective variables in mortality, and positive CT was a factor significantly affecting the hospital LOS.
Paying special attention to high-risk patients and modifiable risk factors such as heart disease, liver disease, and other chronic diseases can diminish the complications and mortality rate of COVID-19.
Providing training, especially for those who care for patients experiencing respiratory distress such as nurses and operating room personnel can improve the qualifications and skills of medical staff.
Also, ensuring the availability of sufficient supply of medical equipment is strongly recommended.
