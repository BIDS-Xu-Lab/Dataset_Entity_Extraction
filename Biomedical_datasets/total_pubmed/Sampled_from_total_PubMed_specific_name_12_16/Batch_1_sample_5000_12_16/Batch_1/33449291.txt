High-dimensional flow cytometry experiments have become a method of choice for high-throughput integration and characterization of cell populations.
Here, we present a summary of state-of-the-art R-based pipelines used for differential analyses of cytometry data, largely based on chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies.
These pipelines are based on publicly available R libraries, put together in a systematic and functional fashion, therefore free of cost.
In recent years, existing tools tailored to analyze complex high-dimensional data such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) have been successfully ported to cytometry studies due to the similar nature of flow cytometry and scRNAseq platforms.
Existing environments like Cytobank (Kotecha et al., 2010), FlowJo (FlowJoâ„¢ Software) and FCS Express (https://denovosoftware.com) already offer a variety of these ported tools, but they either come at a premium or are fairly complicated to manage by an inexperienced user.
To mitigate these limitations, experienced cytometrists and bioinformaticians usually incorporate these functions into an RShiny (https://shiny.rstudio.com) application that ultimately offers a user-friendly, intuitive environment that can be used to analyze flow cytometry data.
Computational tools and Shiny-based tools are the perfect answer to the ever-growing dimensionality and complexity of flow cytometry data, by offering a dynamic, yet user-friendly exploratory space, tailored to bridge the space between the lab experimental world and the computational, machine learning space.
