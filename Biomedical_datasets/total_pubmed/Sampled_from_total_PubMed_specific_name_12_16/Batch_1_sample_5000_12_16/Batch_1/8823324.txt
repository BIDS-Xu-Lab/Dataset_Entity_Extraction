To investigate the results of treatment for adult patients with Burkitt's and Burkitt-like non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) undergoing high-dose therapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT), and to determine prognostic factors for this group.
A retrospective analysis of 117 adult patients reported to the lymphoma registry of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) between June 1984 and November 1994.
Seventy of these patients received high-dose therapy and stem-cell transplantation in first complete remission (CR).
Data on all patients were reviewed, and prognostic factors were determined by univariate and multivariate analysis.
The actuarial overall survival (OS) rate for the entire group was 53% at 3 years.
The major factor predicting for outcome after transplantation was disease status: the 3-year actuarial OS rate was 72% for patients transplanted in first CR, compared with 37% for patients in chemosensitive relapse, and 7% for chemoresistant patients.
For patients transplanted in first CR, disease bulk at the time of ASCT was the only factor predictive of progression-free survival (PFS) and OS.
The results of high-dose therapy and ASCT for patients with relapsed disease, particularly chemosensitive relapse, are superior to those reported for conventional-dose salvage regimens.
The results for patients transplanted in first CR require comparison with modern dose-intensive regimens.
