Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in neonates (MIS-N) related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has increasingly been reported worldwide amid the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL and preprint servers (BioRxiv.org and MedRxiv.org) using a specified strategy integrating Medical Subject Headings terms and keywords until October 20, 2021.
Our aim was to systematically review demographic profiles, clinical features, laboratory parameters, complications, treatments, and outcomes of neonates with MIS-N. Studies were selected when fulfilling the inclusion criteria.
Articles were included if they fulfilled the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control (CDC) definitions of MIS-C, or our proposed definition.
Sixteen reports of MIS-N including 47 neonates meeting MIS-N criteria were identified.
Presentation included cardiovascular compromise (77%), respiratory involvement (55%), and fever in (36%).
Eighty-three percent of patients received steroids, and 76% received immunoglobulin.
Respiratory support was provided to 60% of patients and inotropes to 45% of patients.
The common presentation of MIS-N included cardiorespiratory compromise with the possibility of high mortality.
Neonates with MIS-N related to SARS-CoV-2 may be at higher risk of adverse outcomes.
