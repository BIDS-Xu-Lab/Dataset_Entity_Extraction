In August 2006, leaf spots were observed on half-high blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) in a plant nursery in Dalian, China.
The symptomatic potted 1-year-old blueberry plants were located in parts of a plant nursery with poor ventilation.
The primary symptom was a leaf spot, 0.4 to 0.8 cm in diameter, with brown margins that enlarged and coalesced.
Mycelium grew from symptomatic and green leaf tissue removed from the margin of a necrotic leaf spot.
Plant tissues were surface disinfested with 0.1% mercuric chloride for 3 min and 70% ethyl alcohol for 30 s before plating onto potato dextrose agar.
The resulting colonies were white with a regular margin and a rough surface.
The cultures were covered with black and globular acervuli with a diameter of 100 to 200 μm.
The base of each conidiophore was swollen and globose with phialides growing from the apical end.
Mature conidia were straight to fusiform, measuring 19.0 to 27.5 × 6.3 to 9.2 μm, and five-celled with the three middle cells brown and darker than the end cells.
The apical cell was triangular and hyaline with three simple setulae that were 17.2 to 29.7 μm long.
The base cell terminated in a point 4.0 to 8.6 μm long.
Koch's postulates were fulfilled for the fungus by spray inoculating two healthy young plants with 2 × 105 conidia per ml of sterile distilled water.
As a control, two similar plants were sprayed with sterile water.
Plants were placed inside plastic bags to maintain humidity and incubated in a growth chamber at 26°C under fluorescent light for 14 h and at 20°C in darkness for 10 h. After 3 days, the plastic bags were removed and plants were maintained under the same conditions.
More than 20 days after inoculation, symptoms on inoculated plants were similar to those previously described in the nursery.
Control plants did not show any symptoms.
Cultures isolated from the lesions were similar to those isolated previously from plants in the nursery.
The morphological descriptions and measurements were similar to Pestalotiopsis clavispora (1).
The 5.8S subunit and flanking internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) of rDNA and partial β-tubulin gene were amplified from DNA extracted from single-spore cultures using the ITS1/ITS4 and T1/Bt2b primers (2) respectively, and sequenced (GenBank Accession Nos. EF119336 and EF152585).
Endo 389 (96%; GenBank Accession No. AY682929).
The partial β-tubulin gene sequence was identical to Pestalotiopsis sp. isolate PSHI 2004 Endo 86 (100%; GenBank Accession No. DQ657901).
The morphology and sequence data support the identity of the causal fungus as P. clavispora.
To our knowledge, this is the first report on the presence of a Pestalotiopsis sp. causing a disease of blueberry in China.
