The European "Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence" (HELENA) project evaluated two different approaches to harmonize the matching procedures between 24-h recall data and food composition databases.
In the first approach, the 24-h recall data were linked to the local/national food composition databases using standardized procedures, while in the second approach, the 24-h recall data were linked to the German BLS database which includes a larger food list.
The aim of this paper was to compare the intakes of energy and eight nutrient components calculated via both approaches.
Two non-consecutive 24-h recalls were performed in 1268 adolescents.
Energy, carbohydrates, proteins, fat, fiber, water, alcohol, calcium and vitamin C were calculated via the two approaches at individual level.
Paired samples t test and Pearson's correlations were used to compare the mean intakes of energy and the eight mentioned nutrients and to investigate the possible associations between the two approaches.
Small but significant differences were found between the intakes of energy and the eight food components when comparing both approaches.
Very strong and strong correlations (0.70-0.95) were found between both methods for all nutrients.
The dietary intakes obtained via the two different linking procedures are highly correlated for energy and the eight nutrients under study.
