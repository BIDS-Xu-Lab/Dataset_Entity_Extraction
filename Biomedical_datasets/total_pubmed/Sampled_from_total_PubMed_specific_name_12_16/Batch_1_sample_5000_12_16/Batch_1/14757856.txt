Studies on the role of the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the gene coding for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in atherosclerosis have been inconsistent.
In a meta-analysis, we recently showed that this relationship is stronger in high risk populations.
In this paper, we used a combined functional and population based approach to investigate the gene-environment interaction of the ACE I/D polymorphism in relation to carotid artery wall thickness.
The study was part of the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population based cohort study.
In 5321 subjects, IMT was measured in the carotid arteries by ultrasonography and ACE genotype was determined by size analysis of polymerase chain reaction products.
In multiple regression analysis, I/D polymorphism and smoking were the main determinants for plasma ACE activity (r(2) = 0.28).
There was a positive association between the D allele of the I/D polymorphism and carotid artery thickness among current smokers (p = 0.03).
Subjects carrying only one of the risk factors (smoking or the D allele) did not show significant differences in IMT compared with the non-/former smokers group carrying two II alleles, while carriers of both risk factors had significant higher IMT.
The association was not present in non-/former smokers.
The results provide further evidence that genetic and environmental factors interact in the formation of the arterial lesions.
This study shows that large population based studies can be extremely helpful in unravelling the genetic origin of complex diseases such as atherosclerosis.
