Colectomies are common yet costly, with high surgical-site infection rates.
Safety-net hospitals (SNHs) carry a large proportion of uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients, which has been associated with poorer surgical outcomes.
Few studies have examined the effect of safety-net burden (SNB) status on colectomy outcomes.
We aimed to quantify the independent effects of hospital SNB and surgical site infection (SSI) status on colectomy outcomes, as well as the interaction effect between SSIs and SNB.
We used the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's State Inpatient Databases for California, Florida, New York, Maryland, and Kentucky.
We included 459,568 colectomies (2009 to 2014) for analysis, excluding patients age <18 y and rectal cases.
The primary and secondary outcomes were inpatient mortality and complications, respectively.
[CI]: 1.25-1.51, P < 0.001), compared with low SNB hospitals and to experience perioperative complications (aOR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.04-1.20, P < 0.01).
Colectomy patients with SSIs also had greater odds of in-hospital mortality (aOR:
1.92, 95% CI: 1.83-2.02, P < 0.001) and complications (aOR: 3.65, 95% CI: 3.55-3.75, P < 0.001) compared with those without infections.
Patients treated at SNHs who developed a SSI were even more likely to have an additional perioperative complication (aOR: 4.33, 95% CI: 3.98-4.71, P < 0.001).
Our study demonstrated that colectomy patients at SNHs have poorer outcomes, and for patients with SSIs, this disparity was even more pronounced in the likelihood for a complication.
SNB should be recognized as a significant hospital-level factor affecting colectomy outcomes, with SSIs as an important quality metric.
