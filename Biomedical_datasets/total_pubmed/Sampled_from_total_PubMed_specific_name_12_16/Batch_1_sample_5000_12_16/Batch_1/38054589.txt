In pediatric patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS), living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) raises substantial challenges regarding IVC reconstruction.
We present a case of an 8-year-old girl with BCS caused by myeloproliferative syndrome with JAK2 V617F mutation.
She had a complete thrombosis of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with multiple collaterals, developing a Budd-Chiari syndrome.
She underwent LDLT with IVC reconstruction with a cryopreserved pulmonary vein graft obtained from a provincial biobank.
The living donor underwent a laparoscopic-assisted left lateral hepatectomy.
The reconstruction of the vena cava took place on the back table and the liver was implanted en bloc with the reconstructed IVC in the recipient.
Anticoagulation was immediately restarted after the surgery because of her pro-thrombotic state.
Her postoperative course was complicated by a biliary anastomotic leak and an infected biloma.
The patient recovered progressively and remained well on outpatient clinic follow-up 32â€‰weeks after the procedure.
IVC reconstruction using a cryopreserved pulmonary vein graft is a valid option during LDLT for pediatric patients with BCS where reconstruction of the IVC entails considerable challenges.
Early referral to a pediatric liver transplant facility with a multidisciplinary team is also important in the management of pediatric patients with BCS.
