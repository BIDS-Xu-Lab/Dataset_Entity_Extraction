To describe and compare demographics, outcomes, and comorbidities among schizophrenia patients according to treatment response.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the United States through the Adelphi Schizophrenia Disease Specific Program from January to May 2014.
Participating physicians provided information on the first 10 schizophrenia patients aged â‰¥ 18 years they saw in daily clinical practice; these patients were invited to voluntarily complete a patient self-completion form.
Patients were considered partial responders or responders based on the physician-reported Clinical Global Impressions improvement scale.
Regression analyses were performed to identify potential drivers of response and the clinical and humanistic outcomes associated with response.
150 physicians provided data on 433 partial responders and 872 responders; 185 partial responders and 415 responders completed a patient self-completion form.
A significant predictor of response was always being adherent with the medication regimen (P < .001).
Positive symptoms (P = .006) and moderate (P = .004) or severe (P = .002) illness severity were significant predictors of inadequate response.
Responders were more likely to have better EQ-5D (EuroQol 5 Dimensions) visual analog scale, Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire, and work productivity and impairment scores (all P < .05).
Partial responders were more likely to have significantly poorer clinical and quality of life outcomes compared with responders.
Improved therapeutic approaches, either new therapies or optimized treatments, could lead to both better outcomes and improved adherence in this population.
