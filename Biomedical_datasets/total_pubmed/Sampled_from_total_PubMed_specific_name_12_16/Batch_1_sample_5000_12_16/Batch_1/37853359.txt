Shift work has been related to adverse health outcomes that can partially be attributed to physical inactivity.
However, our knowledge of the influence of shift work on physical activity and sedentary behavior is inconclusive.
Therefore, this study aimed to assess physical activity levels among shift and non-shift workers among a sample of Iranian adults.
Baseline data of the Ravansar Non-Communicable Disease (RaNCD) cohort study were used.
All participants of RaNCD except those excluded due to unemployment or considerable disability were included in the study.
We evaluated participants' physical activity levels using the PERSIAN cohort questionnaire and examined its associations with being a shift worker.
A total of 4695 participants with a mean age of 46.1 (SD = 7.74) were included in the study.
In total, 1108 (23.6%) participants were shift workers, 1420 (30.2%) had insufficient physical activity levels, and 4283 (91.2%) were male.
The prevalence of physical inactivity was significantly lower among shift workers compared to non-shift workers (21% vs. 33.1%, p < 0.001).
Multiple backward stepwise binary logistic regression tests indicated that being a shift worker was significantly associated with a lower chance of having insufficient physical activity levels (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.65-0.92, p = 0.003).
The prevalence of insufficient physical activity was higher among non-shift workers than shift workers in our study.
By providing the factors associated with insufficient physical activity among the workers in a region of Iran, the current study findings might help policymakers target groups at higher risk of physical activity in Iran and design interventions to improve physical activity, especially among non-shift workers.
