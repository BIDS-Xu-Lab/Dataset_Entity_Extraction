An in-depth understanding of the prognostic value of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) is essential to facilitate person-centred care in heart failure (HF).
This study aimed to clarify the prognostic role of subjective mental and physical health status in patients with HF.
Patients with HF were identified from the DenHeart Survey (n = 1499) and PRO data were obtained at hospital discharge, including the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D), the HeartQoL, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).
Clinical baseline data were obtained from medical records and linked to nationwide registries with patient-level data on sociodemographics and healthcare contacts.
Outcomes were all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality, CV events, and HF hospitalization with 1- and 3-year follow-up.
Analysing the PRO data on a continuous scale, a worse score in the following were associated with risk of all-cause and CV mortality after 1 year: the HeartQoL (adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) 1.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-2.57 and 2.17, 95% CI 1.50-3.15, respectively), the EQ-5D (adjusted HRs 1.26, 95% CI 1.15-1.38 and 1.27, 95% CI 1.13-1.42, respectively), the HADS depression subscale (adjusted HRs 1.12, 95% CI 1.07-1.17 and 1.11, 95% CI 1.05-1.17, respectively), and the HADS anxiety subscale (adjusted HRs 1.08, 95% CI 1.03-1.13 and 1.09, 95% CI 1.04-1.15, respectively).
Three-year results were overall in concordance with the 1-year results.
A similar pattern was also observed for non-fatal outcomes.
Health-related quality of life and symptoms of anxiety and depression at discharge were associated with all-cause and CV mortality at 1- and 3-year follow-up.
Y: DenHeart Survey, EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D), HeartQoL, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (No need to annotate, just for notice).
