The mechanism of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development induced by liver fibrosis is obscure.
The objective of this study is to establish miRNAs from exosomes associated with liver fibrosis, and to identify potential biomarkers for the prediction of personalized clinical management effectiveness in HCC.
Our research focused on miRNAs from exosomes and mRNA from liver fibrosis, which we found in the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database.
Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) evaluated miRNAs from exosomes associated with liver fibrosis, and Wilcoxon analysis assessed differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs) across liver fibrosis/normal tissues.
Following that, DEGs were assessed through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), gene ontology (GO), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).
In addition, based on the screened targeted genes, including SAMD12 and CADM2, we further elucidated their correlation in HCC patients from the BEST database.
The Kaplan-Meier Plotter platform was applied to evaluate the prognostic values of miRNA in HCC.
In vitro and vivo experiments validated our findings.
Six miRNAs associated with liver fibrosis were evaluated in our investigation.
In-depth research presented exosome-derived miR-106a-5p, SAMD12 and CADM2 could exert valuable predictive implications for HCC treatment and illness assessment.
Serum miR-106a-5p derived from liver fibrosis was decreased compared with healthy individuals.
SAMD12 and CADM2 were diminished in liver cancer cell lines, and their knockdown of them exacerbated the proliferation capacities of liver cells in vitro.
Exosome-derived miRNA of liver fibrosis modulated tumorigenesis by targeting SAMD12 and CADM2 in HCC.
