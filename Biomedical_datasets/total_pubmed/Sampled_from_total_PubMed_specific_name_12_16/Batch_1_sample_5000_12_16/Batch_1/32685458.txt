Lupus nephritis (LN) is a major and severe complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), as a promising next-generation biomarker in clinical nephrology, has received extensive attention.
However, its diagnostic performance in LN has high variability.
Therefore, we performed an updated meta-analysis to further evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of urinary NGAL (uNGAL).
PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to October 27, 2019.
Meta-analysis was performed with a bivariate random effects model.
Additionally, the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves were established.
The sources of heterogeneity were explored by meta-regression, subgroup analysis, and sensitivity analysis.
Publication bias was assessed using the Deeks test.
19 articles consisting of 21 eligible studies were included.
In diagnosing LN, the estimates (95% confidence interval (CI)) were as follows: sensitivity, 0.84 (0.71-0.91); specificity, 0.91 (0.70-0.98); and the SROC-AUC value, 0.92 (0.90-0.94).
In identifying active LN, the estimates were as follows: sensitivity, 0.72 (0.56-0.84); specificity, 0.71 (0.51-0.84); and the AUC value, 0.77 (0.74-0.81).
With respect to predicting renal flare, the estimates were as follows: sensitivity, 0.80 (0.57-0.92); specificity, 0.67 (0.58-0.75); and the AUC value, 0.74 (0.70-0.78).
For the studies to distinguish proliferative LN, the estimates were as follows: sensitivity, 0.87 (0.66-0.97), and specificity, 0.69 (0.39-0.91).
Deeks' funnel plot suggested that there was no significant publication bias.
Our meta-analysis indicates that uNGAL was a useful biomarker for diagnosis, estimation of activity, and prediction of renal flare of LN.
In addition, the usefulness of uNGAL to distinguish pathological types of LN needs to be further investigated.
