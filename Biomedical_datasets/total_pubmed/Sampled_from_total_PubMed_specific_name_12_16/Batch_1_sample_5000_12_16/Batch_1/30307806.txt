The Syrian crisis, which started in 2011, has had a profound impact on the entire region.
Jordan, with its limited resources, now has the second highest ratio of refugees to inhabitants in the world (89 to 1,000).
The actual number of Syrians in Jordan is hotly contested: more than 630,776 refugees registered in November 2015 compared with 1,265,514 reported by the national census conducted at the same time.
Although the numbers are slowly but steadily increasing, the number of patients with cancer who were registered by the Jordan Cancer Registry peaked in 2013 at 510 patients reported and subsequently slumped downward, which coincided with changes in funding as a result of the increasing strains on the Ministry of Health.
Older individuals, women, and patients with advanced diseases were less likely to be registered.
These findings overlap with data obtained from the authors' own center registry.
Using age- and sex-specific population-based incidence rates, we estimated that 869 Syrians are diagnosed with cancer in Jordan annually.
Using diagnosis-specific cost records of the King Hussein Cancer Foundation, we estimated that the cost of their treatments is 15.6 million Jordan dinars (US$22.1 million).
