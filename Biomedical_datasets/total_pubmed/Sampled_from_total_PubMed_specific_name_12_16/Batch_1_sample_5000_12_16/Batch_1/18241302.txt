Type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemias co-occur frequently with schizophrenia.
It is not known how common they are in adolescents with a familial risk for psychosis.
The Northern Finland 1986 Birth Cohort consists of 9432 children born alive in the two Northernmost provinces in Finland.
At the age of 15/16 they participated in clinical examination including measurements of glucose, lipids and IR, and a questionnaire including items about their diet and physical activity.
The Finnish Hospital Discharge Register was used to find out non-organic psychoses in parents during 1972-2000.
This familial risk was found out in 54 boys and 68 girls.
Their results were compared with other cohort members.
No differences were observed in the cardiometabolic risk factors between the study groups.
Our results suggest that familial risk for psychosis is not directly associated with disturbances of glucose and lipid metabolism among adolescents.
