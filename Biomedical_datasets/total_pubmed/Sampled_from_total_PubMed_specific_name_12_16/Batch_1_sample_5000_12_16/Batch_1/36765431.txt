Increasing evidence indicates that psoriasis (PSO) and periodontitis (PD) are likely to occur together, however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear.
The expression profiles of PSO (lesion vs non-lesion, GSE30999, GSE14905) and PD (affected vs unaffected gingival tissue, GSE16134, GSE10334) were downloaded from the GEO database.
First, we investigated the common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of PSO and PD.
Then, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, protein interaction network (PPI) construction, and hub gene identification analysis were carried out.
Finally, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, miRNA interaction analysis, and transcription factors (TFs) interaction analysis for hub genes were performed.
Eighteen DEGs were identified for further analysis, including 15 up-regulated genes and 3 down-regulated genes.
9 hub genes were then identified via Cytohubba, including IL1B, CXCL1, CXCL8, MMP12, CCL18, SELL, CXCL13, FCGR3B, and SELE.
Their functions are mainly enriched in two aspects: neutrophil chemotaxis and migration, chemokine activation and interaction.
The enriched signaling pathways includes three categories: host defense, inflammation-related signaling pathways, and disease-related pathways.
9 common miRNAs based on experimental evidence and 10 common TFs were further identified in both PSO and PD.
Our study revealed possible comorbidity mechanisms in PSO and PD from the perspective of bioinformatics tentatively.
The data can present new insight for joint prevention and treatment of in PSO and PD, as well as provide data support for further prospective studies.
