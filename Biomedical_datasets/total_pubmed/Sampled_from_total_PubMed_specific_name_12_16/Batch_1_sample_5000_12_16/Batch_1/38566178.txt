A standardized national approach to routinely assessing palliative care patients helps improve patient outcomes.
However, a quality improvement program-based on person centered outcomes within palliative care is lacking in Mainland China.
The well-established Australian Palliative Care Outcome Collaboration (PCOC) national model improves palliative care quality.
This study aimed to culturally adapt and validate three measures that form part of the PCOC program for palliative care clinical practice in China: The PCOC Symptom Assessment Scale (PCOC SAS), Palliative Care Problem Severity Scale (PCPSS), Palliative Care Phase.
A study was conducted on cross-cultural adaptation and validation of PCOC SAS, PCPSS and Palliative Care Phase, involving translation methods, cognitive interviewing, and psychometric testing through paired assessments.
Cross-cultural adaptation highlighted the need to strengthen the link between the patient's care plan and the outcome measures to improve outcomes, and the concept of distress in PCOC SAS.
Analysis of 368 paired assessments (n = 135 inpatients, 22 clinicians) demonstrated that the PCOC SAS and PCPSS had good and acceptable coherence (Cronbach's a = 0.85, 0.75 respectively).
Palliative Care Phase detected patients' urgent needs.
PCOC SAS and PCPSS showed fair discriminant and concurrent validity.
Inter-rater reliability was fair for Palliative Care Phase (k = 0.31) and PCPSS (k = 0.23-0.30), except for PCPSS-pain, which was moderate (k = 0.53).
The Chinese version of PCOC SAS, PCPSS, and Palliative Care Phase can be used to assess outcomes as part of routine clinical practice in Mainland China.
Comprehensive clinical education regarding the assessment tools is necessary to help improve the inter-rater reliability.
