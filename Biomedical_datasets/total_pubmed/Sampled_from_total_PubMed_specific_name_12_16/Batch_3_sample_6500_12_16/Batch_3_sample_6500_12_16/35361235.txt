Soluble programmed death-1 (sPD-1) is a novel immune markers and possibly predictive of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) outcome.
However, results were inconsistent by different ELISA kits.
This study aims to compare the characteristics and correlations with other markers for sPD-1 measured by MyBioSource (MB) and R&D (RD) kits.
A total of 254 untreated CHB patients from three sites were assayed with sPD-1 by MB and RD kits at the same time.
Spearman's correlations between the kits, and those with viral markers and ALT levels were calculated.
Multivariate linear regression analysis was applied for independent factors associated with the sPD-1 levels.
There's no correlation between sPD-1 level using MB and RD assays.
sPD-1 by MB correlated profoundly with HBsAg (r = 0.8311, P < 0.0001), HBV DNA (r = 0.3896, P < 0.0001), and ALT levels (r = 0.1604, P = 0.0105) while an opposite trend by RD kit (r = - 0.0644, P = 0.3109; r = 0.2554, P < 0.0001; r = 0.4417, P < 0.0001, respectively for the 3 markers).
In the multivariate linear regression analysis, HBsAg and ALT levels was the major factor associated with sPD-1 levels by MB and RD, respectively.
The characteristics and correlations with host/viral markers of sPD-1 by the two kits are different and leading to different associations on clinical outcomes of CHB.
