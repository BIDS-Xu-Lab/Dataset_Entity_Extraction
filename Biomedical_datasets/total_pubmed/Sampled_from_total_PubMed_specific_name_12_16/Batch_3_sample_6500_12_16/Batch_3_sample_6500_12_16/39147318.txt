Basic helix-loop-helix ARNT like 2 (ARNTL2) is a transcription factor that controls the circadian rhythm.
Amounts of studies have demonstrated the carcinogenic function of ARNTL2 in human malignant tumors albeit the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.
We aimed to study the significance of ARNTL2 in bladder cancer (BLCA).
Immunohistochemical staining, immunoblotting and the database from TCGA were used to analyze the clinical relevance of ARNTL2, enolase 1 (ENO1) and solute carrier family 31 member 1 (SLC31A1) in BLCA.
The function of ARNTL2 was explored by cell proliferation assay, apoptosis, colony formation and xenografted tumorigenesis.
The molecular mechanisms of ARNTL2-driving BLCA development were investigated by RT-qPCR, immunoblotting and luciferase assays.
Glycolysis was checked by measuring glucose consumption and lactate production.
ENO1 activity was assessed by using indicated assay kit.
Overexpression of ARNTL2 facilitates the proliferation and tumorigenesis of BLCA cells through suppression of apoptosis and enhancement of glycolysis.
Up-regulation of SLC31A1, ENO1, and enhancement of SLC31A1-mediated ENO1 activity were critical for ARNTL2-triggered glycolysis and malignant growth in BLCA cells.
ARNTL2 was positively correlated with SLC31A1 and ENO1 in BLCA patients.
High expression of ARNTL2, SLC31A1 or ENO1 predicted the poor prognosis of BLCA patients.
Depletion of SLC31A1 and inhibition of glycolysis completely blunted the growth ability of BLCA cells.
In summary, ARNTL2 facilitates the progression of BLCA via activating ENO1-mediated glycolysis in a SLC31A1-independent and -dependent manner.
Inhibiting SLC31A1 and glycolysis may be an aspirational approach for the treatment of BLCA patients with overexpression of ARNTL2.
