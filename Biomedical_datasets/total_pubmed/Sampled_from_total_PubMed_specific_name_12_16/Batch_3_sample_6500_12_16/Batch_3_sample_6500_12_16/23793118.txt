To examine the influence of a number of variables, including age and medical school entrance category, on postgraduate retention of New Zealand (NZ) medical graduates.
An anonymised database was created of all graduates from the Otago School of Medicine (1999-2010), with demographic and entry category data.
The NZ Medical Register was checked in January 2012 to identify which graduates remained in NZ.
Risk Differences (RD) were calculated to compare retention between medical school entrance categories by year of graduation using the random effects Mantel-Haenszel method.
The influence of covariates on remaining on the New Zealand Medical Register was evaluated using logistic regression.
The odds of remaining on the NZ Medical Register increased by 7% for each additional year of age at graduation (Odds Ratio=1.070, 95%CI 1.038-1.113, p<0.001).
Compared with students who entered medical school after a competitive first year exam, retention of students who entered after completion of a bachelor's degree was 7% higher, and 20% higher for "Other Category" (older, work experienced) students.
Multiple logistic regression identified medical school entry category as the only significant predictor of higher retention.
Admission policies favouring graduate entry and "Other Category" students could contribute to increased retention of NZ medical graduates.
