Many researchers around the world are working to reach a general framework to provide solutions for COVID-19 in different ways.
From our economic and business orientation, "Health, Longevity, Infrastructure and Competitiveness" are presented in this paper as the Four Horsemen of COVID-19.
Our aim is to analyse the relationship between these proposed four factors and their influence on COVID-19.
Using the Global Competitive Index (GCI), Health Systems in Transition (HiT) and the System of Health Accounts (SHA), we complete a database for a total of 28 countries of the European Union, including the United Kingdom and using variables related to the environment of each region (competitiveness, security, infrastructure, population and health system).
Our study is focused on a descriptive analysis and a binary logistic model (logit), trying to distinguish between countries with more and less incidence of COVID-19.
According to the results, the presence of these four factors - which are desirables for any country - implies a greater transmission of the virus in these regions.
However, a higher annual expenditure in the health system is related to a lower incidence of COVID-19.
