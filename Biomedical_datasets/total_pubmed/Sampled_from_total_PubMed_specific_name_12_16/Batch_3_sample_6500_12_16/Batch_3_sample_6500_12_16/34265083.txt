Cancer and its treatment damage the musculoskeletal system and induce neurotoxicity, affecting the key sensory inputs for maintaining balance.
The present study describes the pattern of balance impairment and evaluated its association with mortality among US cancer survivors.
Data on a nationally representative sample of cancer survivors from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2015 was analyzed.
Sensory-specific balance impairment was measured at baseline by the modified Romberg test of standing balance on firm and compliant support surfaces.
The linked mortality data were updated through December 31, 2015.
Among 511 cancer survivors, 282 (48.3%) had a balance impairment, predominantly attributing to vestibular dysfunction (251; 89.0% of 282 and 44.5% of 511).
A higher prevalence of balance impairment was observed among cancer survivors with advanced age, lower socioeconomic status or educational attainment, body mass index <25 kg/m2 , and an inactive lifestyle.
During up to 16.4 years of follow-up (median, 11.3 years; 5088 person-years), 253 cancer survivors had died.
Cancer survivors with a balance impairment had a 63% higher risk of death from all causes (hazard ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-2.38) after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, comorbidities, and cancer type.
Specifically, those with vestibular dysfunctions had approximately 1.54 (95% CI, 1.05-2.27) times the risk of death compared to those without any balance impairment.
These associations were stronger in males than in females.
In a US nationally representative sample of cancer survivors, balance impairment and vestibular dysfunctions were prevalent and associated with heightened all-cause mortality.
