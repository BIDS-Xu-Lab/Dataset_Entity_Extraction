Little is known about the extent to which microvascular disease is associated with cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) among individuals with type 2 diabetes.
A total of 4,766 participants with type 2 diabetes underwent maximal exercise testing in the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) study at baseline.
Low CRF was defined based on the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study reference standards.
Microvascular disease was defined as having one or more of diabetes-related kidney disease (DKD), retinopathy, and neuropathy.
The burden of microvascular disease was defined as the number of microvascular beds affected.
Of the 4,766 participants (mean age 58.9 Â± 6.7 years, 58.5% women, 66.1% White individuals), 1,761 (37%) had microvascular disease.
Participants with microvascular complications in three vascular territories had a lower CFR than those without any microvascular disease (mean adjusted metabolic equivalent of task [MET] 6.58 vs. 7.26, P = 0.001).
Participants with any microvascular disease had higher odds of low CRF than those without microvascular disease (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.45, 95% CI 1.24-1.71).
An increasing burden of microvascular disease was associated with higher odds of low CRF (for microvascular disease in three vascular territories, adjusted OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.36-5.85).
Adjusted ORs for low CRF were 1.24 (95% CI 0.99-1.55), 1.34 (95% CI 1.02-1.76), and 1.44 (95% CI 1.20-1.73) for neuropathy, retinopathy, and DKD associations, respectively.
In a large cohort of adults with type 2 diabetes, the presence of microvascular disease and its burden were independently associated with lower CRF.
