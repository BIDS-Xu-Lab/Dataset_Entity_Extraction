Do chronically high-lonely individuals exhibit specific memory biases when recalling past social episodes?
We explored negative memory biases, focusing on the recall of unfavourable social experiencesÂ and social memory biases, emphasizing the recall of social experiences irrespective of emotional valence.
We conducted a dictionary-based semantic analysis of autobiographical episodes obtained from 4095 participants via four datasets.
Participants recalled a positive, negative or emotionally neutral episode from their recent past.
High-lonely individuals predominantly exhibited a decline in recalling positive social episodes, providing partial support for negative memory biases.
However, both high- and low-lonely individuals were similarly inclined to recall negative social episodes.
These results suggest that the primary issue among high-lonely individuals is the limited recall of positive social experiences rather than the general negativity in memory biases or the hypersensitivity to general social memories.
