Internationally wheelchair users are an emerging demographic phenomenon due to their rapidly increasing life-span coupled with accelerated general population ageing.
While having significant healthcare and social implications, basic robust epidemiological information of wheelchair users is often lacking due in part to this population's "hidden" nature.
Increasingly popular in epidemiological research, Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) provides a mechanism for generating unbiased population-based estimates for hard-to-reach populations, overcoming biases inherent within other sampling methods.
This paper reports the first published study to employ RDS amongst wheelchair users.
Between October 2015 and January 2016, a short, successfully piloted, internet-based national survey was initiated.
Twenty seeds from diverse organisations were invited to complete the survey then circulate it to peers within their networks following a well-defined protocol.
A predetermined reminder protocol was triggered when seeds or their peers failed to respond.
All participants were entered into a draw for an iPad.
Overall, 19 people participated (9 women); 12 initial seeds, followed by seven second-wave participants arising from four seeds .
Completion time for the survey ranged between 7 and 36 minutes.
Despite repeated reminders, no further people were recruited.
While New Zealand wheelchair user numbers are unknown, an estimated 14% of people have physical impairments that limited mobility.
The 19 respondents generated from adopting the RDS methodology here thus represents a negligible fraction of wheelchair users in New Zealand, and an insufficient number to ensure equilibrium.
While successful in other hard-to-reach populations, applying RDS methodology to wheelchairs users requires further consideration.
Formative research exploring areas of network characteristics, acceptability of RDS, appropriate incentive options, and seed selection amongst wheelchair users is needed.
