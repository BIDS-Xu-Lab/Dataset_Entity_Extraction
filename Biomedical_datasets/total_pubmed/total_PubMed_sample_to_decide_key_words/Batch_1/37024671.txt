Considered heavy metals, such as As(III), Bi(II), Cd(II), Cr(VI), Mn(II), Mo(II), Ni(II), Pb(II), Sb(III), Se(-II), Zn(II), and contaminating chemical compounds (monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as phenolic or polycyclic derivatives) in wastewater (petrochemical industries: oil and gas production plants) are currently a major concern in environmental toxicology due to their toxic effects on aquatic and terrestrial life.
In order to maintain biodiversity, hydrosphere ecosystems, and people, it is crucial to remove these heavy metals and polluting chemical compounds from the watery environment.
In this study, different Nanoparticles (Î±-Fe2O3, CuO, and ZnO) were synthesized by green synthesis method using Portulaca oleracea leaf extract and characterized by UV-Vis spectrophotometers, FTIR spectroscopy, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) techniques in order to investigate morphology, composition, and crystalline structure of NPs, these were then used as adsorbent for the removal of As(III), Bi(II), Cd(II), Cr(VI), Mn(II), Mo(II), Ni(II), Pb(II), Sb(III), Se(-II), and Zn(II) from wastewater, and removal efficiencies of were obtained 100% under optimal conditions.
