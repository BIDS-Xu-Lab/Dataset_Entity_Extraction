Highly sensitive differential scanning microcalorimetry (DSC) has been used to investigate the phase transition properties of lipid vesicles prepared from 1,2-distearoyl-L-3-glyceryl-phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) in H(2)O and D(2)O. The data show that the response of pre-transition properties to D(2)O-->H(2)O substitution is stronger than the main transition properties.
We find that there is a small increase in the phase transition temperature (DeltaT approximately 0.5 K) and in the co-operative unit in the main transition.
The increase in enthalpy (DeltaH congruent with1 kJ(.)mol(-1)) and in transition temperature (DeltaT congruent with2 K) observed in the pre-transition is comparable with that observed in quite different processes and systems, i.e. melting of nucleic acids and proteins and gel formation.
It is suggested that D(2)O-->H(2)O substitution affects the thermal transition in these systems in such a way that the contributions of enthalpy and entropy to structural reorganization of water in these processes is modified.
