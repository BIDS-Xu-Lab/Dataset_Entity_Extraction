A 12-week-old kitten was presented for symphyseal separation, comminuted rostral fractures of the mandibles, avulsion of the mandibular lip, andfractured teeth.
Oral examination and intraoral dental radiographs demonstrated a mandibular symphyseal separation and the presence of developing tooth buds.
Cerclage wire was placed circumferentially around the mandibles for 2-weeks to provide stabilization of the mandibular symphyseal separation.
Clinical examination 9.5-months following surgery demonstrated normal occlusion with enamel hypoplasia affecting the mandibular canine teeth.
Intraoral dental radiographs showed a partial bony union of the mandibular symphysis and vital, developing mandibular canine teeth.
