To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of an emotional support programme for newly diagnosed people with multiple sclerosis.
Three-arm, mixed methods, randomised controlled trial comparing usual care, versus usual care plus nurse-specialist support, versus usual care plus nurse-specialist support plus peer support.
Community-dwelling adults within two years of diagnosis or undergoing diagnosis.
PrEliMS involves information provision, emotional support, and strategies and techniques based on psychoeducation, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy principles, supportive listening.
One version of the intervention was provided by nurse-specialists alone and the other was provided by nurse-specialists plus peer support.
The main outcome of interest was the feasibility of proceeding to a definitive trial, exploring recruitment rate, acceptability, completion of outcome measures (perceived stress, mood, self-efficacy, psychological impact, and service use), and signal of efficacy.
Of 40 participants randomised (mean age 36.2 years (SD = 14.8); 54% women; 85% with relapsing-remitting MS), 36 and 38 returned 3- and 6-month questionnaires, respectively.
Participant interviews suggested the trial was largely feasible, and the intervention acceptable, with some amendments to trial procedures and intervention delivery noted.
There were, however, no statistically significant differences between groups at followup for any measures, and effect-size estimates were small.
A definitive trial combining nurse-specialist and peer support adjustment to diagnosis intervention is warranted, but more work exploring the delivery and fidelity of the intervention is needed before this is pursued.
