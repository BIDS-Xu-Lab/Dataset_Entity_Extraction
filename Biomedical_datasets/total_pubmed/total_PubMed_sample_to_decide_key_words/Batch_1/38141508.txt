Unlike children, high-grade brainstem glioma (HG-BSG) in adults is a rare and diverse group of tumors.
They can be classified based on their location and physical characteristics, which distinguishes them from pediatric brainstem gliomas.
They are rare in adults, constituting only 1 % to 2 % of intracranial gliomas.
They are often aggressive and have a poor prognosis, with a median survival time of 24 months.
The diagnosis of brainstem gliomas typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation and imaging studies, mainly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which provides detailed images and can help identify the characteristics of the tumor.
We present a case study of an uncommon presentation of an early stage of HG-BSG in a 33-year-old male, who had a contrast-enhancing lesion in the ventrolateral medulla that extended to the lower aspect of the fourth ventricle and caused ventricular compression.
The findings were consistent with the literature on the current state of HG-BSG MRI findings, which typically show contrast-enhancing, hyperintense, and infiltrative lesions that involve the pons, midbrain, or medulla oblongata.
The diagnosis of HG-BSG was based on clinical and radiological criteria, as the patient refused to undergo a surgical biopsy.
We also performed a literature review on the current state of brainstem HG-BSG MRI findings, summarizing the main features and patterns of these tumors.
MRI can offer useful information regarding the tumor's location, size, and features, as well as its impact on surrounding tissues and cerebrospinal fluid circulation.
