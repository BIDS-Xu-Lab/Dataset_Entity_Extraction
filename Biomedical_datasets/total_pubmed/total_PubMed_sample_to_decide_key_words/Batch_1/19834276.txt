A 74-year-old man with multiple myeloma was refractory to melphalan/prednisolone (MP), high-dose dexamethasone and VAD chemotherapy.
He had the following poor prognostic factors: 1) multiple extramedullary plasmacytomas, 2) massive myelomatous effusion, 3) increasing immature myeloma cells with plasmablastic morphology, and 4) predominance of MPC1-CD49e-CD45+ phenotype immature myeloma cells.
Combination therapy with thalidomide and dexamethasone resulted in a rapid response and a partial remission despite his multiple poor prognostic factors.
The present case suggests that combination therapy with thalidomide and dexamethasone is still an alternative treatment regimen for resistant extramedullary plasmacytoma with a plasmablastic morphology.
