Cyclophosphamide and 1-(4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl)methyl-3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosourea hydrochloride (ACNU) were found to have an equivalent cytostatic effect in rats with subcutaneous transplants of Walker 256 carcinosarcoma.
Rats with meningeal carcinomatosis received a single intravenous dose of cyclophosphamide (30 mg/kg) or ACNU (15 mg/kg) at various times after intracisternal inoculation of 1 X 10(4)
Cyclophosphamide, administered 1 day after tumor inoculation, failed to prevent tumor growth in the subarachnoid space.
The survival time of these rats was prolonged only 10% to 14% compared to the controls, while ACNU produced a maximum increased survival time of 180%.
If administered 2, 3, 4, and 5 days after tumor inoculation, both drugs were effective; cyclophosphamide yielded a maximum increase in median survival time of 109%, 94%, 90%, and 52%, and ACNU 127%, 139%, 240%, and 100%, respectively.
These results indicate that the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier was circumvented in the early stage of subarachnoid tumor growth, although some areas remained where the infiltrating tumor cells were protected from systemically administered drugs by the intact barrier.
