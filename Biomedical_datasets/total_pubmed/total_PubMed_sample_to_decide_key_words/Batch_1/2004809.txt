A cDNA clone, SO7', from an Eimeria tenella cDNA library was inserted into the high-expression vector pJC264 and was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein, CheY-SO7', with a molecular mass of approximately 36 kDa.
By using the purified recombinant antigen to immunize young chicks, it was demonstrated that a single dose, without adjuvant, not only protected against severe coccidiosis induced by infection with E. tenella but also protected chicks challenged with the heterologous species Eimeria acervulina, E. maxima, and E. necatrix.
By using rabbit antiserum raised against recombinant CheY-SO7', Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of sporulated oocysts of all seven major species of chicken coccidia showed that all species tested contained proteins characteristic of the B class of antigens, of which CheY-SO7' is representative.
It seems likely that a single B antigen could protect chickens against severe coccidiosis caused by infection with any of these Eimeria species.
Although chicks exposed to prolonged, natural infection develop antibodies to B antigen, active immunization of young chicks with a protective dose of CheY-SO7' does not elicit a humoral antibody response, suggesting that the partial protection results from cell-mediated effector mechanisms.
In addition, the cross-protective nature of the immunity indicates that the response to B antigen is different from that induced by natural infection, which elicits a species-specific immunity.
To date, the protection induced by B antigen immunization, although remarkable for a single recombinant protein, is not sufficient to compete with prophylactic chemotherapy.
