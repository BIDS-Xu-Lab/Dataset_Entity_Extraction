This paper describes an ongoing research study into the learning practices of medical students.
Responses from structured interviews for forty-four (20%) first-year students at the University of New South Wales indicate that they work long hours, use few resources, consult little with teaching staff, co-operate a lot with each other and see themselves as responsible for their own learning.
It is suggested that teacher training activities should take more notice of the actual learning practices of students if teachers and students are not to become confused and disillusioned.
