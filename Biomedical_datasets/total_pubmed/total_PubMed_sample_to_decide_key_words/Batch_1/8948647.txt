We have determined the location of cis-acting elements that are important for the expression of RPO21 and RPO22, genes that encode the two largest subunits of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
A series of 5'-end deletions and nucleotide substitutions in the upstream regions of RPO21 and RPO22 were tested for their effect on the expression of lacZ fusions of these genes.
Deletion of sequences from -723 to -693 in RPO21, which disrupted two Reb1p-binding sites and an Abf1p-binding site, resulted in a 10-fold decrease in expression.
A T-rich region downstream of these sites was also important for expression.
Deletion of sequences from -437 to -392 in the RPO22-upstream, which resulted in a 30-fold decrease in expression, indicated that the Reb1p- and Abf1p-binding sites in this region were important for RPO22 expression, as was a T-rich sequence immediately downstream of these sites.
The RPO21 and RPO22 upstream regions were capable of interacting in vitro (gel-mobility-shift assays) with Reb1p and Abf1p.
The similarities in the type and organization of elements in the upstream regions of RPO21 and RPO22 suggest that expression of these genes may be regulated coordinately.
