Ovarian tissue cryopreservation is a female fertility preservation technique that presents major challenges for the maintenance of follicular viability after transplantation.
The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the application of L-Mesitran SoftÂ®, a product containing 40% medical grade honey (MGH), with other strategies to improve ovarian grafts' viability.
For this purpose, bovine ovarian tissue was vitrified, warmed and randomly assigned to culture groups: (1) control, (2) MGH 0.2% in vitro, (3) MGH in vivo (direct application in the xenotransplantation), (4) vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF 50 ng/mL) and (5) vitamin D (100 Nm), during a 48 h period.
A sixth group (6) of fragments was thawed on transplantation day and was not cultured.
The tissue was xenotransplanted into immunodeficient (Rowett nude homozygous) ovariectomized rats.
Grafts were analyzed 48 h after culture, and 7 and 28 days after transplantation.
The tissue was subjected to histological and immunohistochemical analysis.
Treatments using MGH showed the highest angiogenic and cell proliferation stimulation, with cellular apoptosis, within a healthy cellular turnover pathway.
In conclusion, MGH should be considered as a potentially effective and less expensive strategy to improve ovarian tissue transplantation.
