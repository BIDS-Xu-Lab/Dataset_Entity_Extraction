Favorable uterine involution and ovarian activity are very important for the next reproductive cycle of postpartum cows.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of parity on uterine involution and resumption of ovarian activity in Chinese Holstein dairy cows after calving under similar postpartum nutritional conditions.
Traits of the status of uterus and ovaries detected by ultrasonography, dry matter intake (DMI), milk yield, body condition score (BCS), and estradiol concentration in milk samples were analyzed for 46 Chinese Holstein dairy cows in various parities (primiparous=18; biparous=13; multiparous=15).
The results showed that there was no significant difference for DMI, BCS, and milk yield among different parities; all cows were considered to be under similar nutritional conditions.
Days of the previous gravid uterine horn involution were significantly greater in primiparous dairy cows than in biparous and multiparous dairy cows.
Days from calving to ovulation (first and second) and the number of follicular waves to first ovulation were significantly greater in primiparous cows than in multiparous cows.
In summary, there was a significant negative relationship between parity and postpartum uterine involution and resumption of ovarian activity in Chinese Holstein cows under similar body conditions.
