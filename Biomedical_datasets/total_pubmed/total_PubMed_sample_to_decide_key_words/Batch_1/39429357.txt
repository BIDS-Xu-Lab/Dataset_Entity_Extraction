We present an unusual case of colovesical fistula formed by a single diverticulum manifesting as prostatitis and urinary tract infection (UTI) before causing further complications.
Diverticulitis is caused by inflammation of the colonic diverticula and manifests as fever and left lower quadrant pain.
The patient also developed recurrent pneumaturia; upon examination, a colovesical fistula was observed on computed tomography (CT), which was managed successfully by laparoscopic repair.
This case highlights manifestations of colovesical fistula secondary to diverticular disease and the laparoscopic approach to treatment.
