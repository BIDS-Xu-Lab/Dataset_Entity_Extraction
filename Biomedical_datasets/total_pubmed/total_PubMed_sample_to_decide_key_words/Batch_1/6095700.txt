Postoperative adrenocortical function was compared in 23 out-patients receiving either thiopental, 4 mg/kg, for induction and a thiopental infusion, 0.26 mg .
min-1, in combination with nitrous oxide 70% for maintenance of anesthesia (control); etomidate, 0.4 mg/kg, for induction followed by an etomidate infusion, 0.02 mg .
min-1, and nitrous oxide 70% for maintenance (etomidate I); or etomidate, 0.4 mg/kg, for induction and a thiopental infusion, 0.22 mg .
min-1, in combination with nitrous oxide 70% for maintenance (etomidate II).
The norepinephrine response to anesthesia and surgery did not differ significantly between the three groups.
[mean +/- SEM] ), however, it was decreased in all patients receiving etomidate, whether by a short infusion (mean change in plasma cortisol was -3.8 +/- 1.9 micrograms/dl) or as a single induction dose (mean change in plasma cortisol was -4.0 +/- 2.0 micrograms/dl).
Similarly, the postoperative aldosterone levels in the control group increased normally in response to ACTH (+ 10.2 +/- 3.0 ng/dl) but decreased in both the etomidate I and etomidate II groups (-3.0 +/- 0.7 ng/dl and -3.3 +/- 1.0 ng/dl, respectively).
Because ACTH was administered exogenously, etomidate-induced suppression of adrenocortical response appeared to be a direct effect on the adrenal gland, which was present at a time when the serum etomidate levels were in the subhypnotic range.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
