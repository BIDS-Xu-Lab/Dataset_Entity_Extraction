Reaction with halogen vapor allows us to post-synthetically exchange halides in both three- (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) organic-inorganic metal-halide perovskites.
Films of 3D Pb-I perovskites cleanly convert to films of Pb-Br or Pb-Cl perovskites upon exposure to Br2 or Cl2 gas, respectively.
This gas-solid reaction provides a simple method to produce the high-quality Pb-Br or Pb-Cl perovskite films required for optoelectronic applications.
Reactivity with halogens can be extended to the organic layers in 2D metal-halide perovskites.
Here, terminal alkene groups placed between the inorganic layers can capture Br2 gas through chemisorption to form dibromoalkanes.
This reaction's selectivity for Br2 over I2 allows us to scrub Br2 to obtain high-purity I2 gas streams.
We also observe unusual halogen transfer between the inorganic and organic layers within a single perovskite structure.
Remarkably, the perovskite's crystallinity is retained during these massive structural rearrangements.
