The bedside head impulse test (bHIT) is a clinical method of assessing the vestibulo-ocular reflex.
It is a critical component of the bedside assessment of dizzy patients and helps differentiate acute stroke from vestibular neuritis.
A previous study on senior Otolaryngology residents showed poor competence in performing and interpreting the bHIT and called for specific evaluations in the Competency By Design (CBD) curriculum to remedy this.
This study aimed to assess whether those competencies have improved after full implementation of CBD in residency programs.
Thirty post-graduate year 4 Otolaryngology residents in Canada were evaluated on the use of the bHIT using a written multiple-choice question (MCQ) examination, interpretation of bHIT videos, and performance of a bHIT.
Ratings of bHIT performance were completed by 2 expert examiners (DT, DL) using the Ottawa Clinic Assessment Tool.
Only 6.7% (rater DT) and 20% (rater DL) of residents were found able to perform the bHIT independently.
Inter-rater reliability was moderate (0.55, intraclass correlation).
Mean scores were 70% (13.4% standard deviation) for video interpretation and 59% (20.6% standard deviation) for multiple-choice questions.
Video interpretation scores did not correlate with bHIT ratings (Pearson r = 0.11), but MCQs and bHIT ratings did correlate moderately (Pearson r = 0.52).Comparing to the prior study, residents performed worse on the bHIT (3.14 average score vs 3.64, P < .01) and fewer residents performed the bHIT independently (6.7% vs 22%-rater DT, 20% vs 39%-rater DL).
Residents also performed worse on MCQs (58.7% vs 70.9%, P = 0.038), though similarly on video interpretation (70% vs 65%, P = .198).
Fourth year OTL-HNS residents in Canada are not competent in performing the bHIT.
These findings have implications for refining competency-based curricula in the evaluation of critical physical exam skills.
