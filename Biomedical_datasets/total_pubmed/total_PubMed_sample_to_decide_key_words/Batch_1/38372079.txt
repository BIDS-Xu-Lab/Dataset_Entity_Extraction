Sepsis frequently causes systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ failure in patients.
Neoastilbin (NAS) is a flavonoid that plays vital functions in inflammation.
This work aims to investigate the protective effects of NAS against sepsis-induced liver and kidney injury and elucidate its underlying mechanisms.
The mouse model was established using cecal ligation puncture (CLP) induction.
NAS was given to mice by gavage for 7 consecutive days before surgery.
Liver and kidney function, oxidative stress, and inflammatory factors in serum or tissues were examined by ELISA or related kits.
The expression of relevant proteins was assessed by Western blot.
Hematoxylin and eosin and/or periodic acid-Schiff staining revealed that NAS ameliorated the pathological damage in liver and kidney tissues of CLP-induced mice.
NAS improved liver and kidney functions, as evidenced by elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, Creatinine, ALT, and AST in the serum of septic mice.
TUNEL assay and the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax showed that NAS dramatically reduced apoptosis in liver and renal tissues.
NAS treatment lowered the levels of myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde, while elevated the superoxide dismutase content in liver and kidney tissues of CLP-induced mice.
The levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β) in the serum and both tissues of CLP-injured mice were markedly decreased by NAS.
Mechanically, NAS downregulated TLR4 expression and inhibited NF-κB activation, and overexpression of TLR4 reversed the protective effects of NAS against liver and kidney injury.
Collectively, NAS attenuated CLP-induced apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, and dysfunction in the liver and kidney by restraining the TLR4/NF-κB pathway.
