Due to the redox properties closely related to numerous physiological and pathological processes, biothiols, including cysteine (Cys), homocysteine (Hcy) and glutathione (GSH), have received considerable attention in biological science.
On account of the important physiological roles of these biothiols, it is of profound significance to develop sensitive and selective detection of biothiols to understand their biological profiles.
In this work, we reported an efficient fluorescent probe, PHPQ-SH, for detecting biothiols in vitro and vivo, based on the phenothiazine-HPQ skeleton, with DNBS (2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonate) as the response unit.
Probe PHPQ-SH exhibited brilliant sensing performances toward thiols, including a large Stokes shift (138 nm), excellent sensitivity (for GSH, LOD = 18.3 nM), remarkable fluorescence enhancement (163-fold), low cytotoxicity, rapid response (8 min), and extraordinary selectivity.
Finally, the probe PHPQ-SH illustrated herein was capable of responding and visualizing biothiols in MCF-7 cells and zebrafish.
