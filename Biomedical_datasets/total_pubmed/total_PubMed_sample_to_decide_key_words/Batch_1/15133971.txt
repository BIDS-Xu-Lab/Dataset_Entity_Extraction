In order to load a muscle optimally during resistance exercise, it should be heavily taxed throughout the entire range of motion for that exercise.
However, traditional constant resistance squats only tax the lower-extremity muscles to their limits at the "sticking region" or a critical joint configuration of the exercise cycle.
Therefore, a linear motion (Smith) exercise machine was modified with pneumatics and appropriate computer control so that it could be capable of adjusting force to control velocity within a repetition of the squat exercise or other exercise performed with the device.
Prior to application of this device in a dynamic squat setting, the maximum voluntary isometric force (MVIF) produced over a spectrum of knee angles is needed.
This would reveal the sticking region and overall variation in strength capacity.
Five incremental knee angles (90, 110, 130, 150, and 170 degrees, where 180 degrees defined full extension) were examined.
After obtaining university-approved informed consent, 12 men and 12 women participated in the study.
The knee angle was set, and the pneumatic cylinder was pressurized such that the subject could move the barbell slightly but no more than two-centimeters.
The peak pressure exerted over a five-second maximum effort interval was recorded at each knee angle in random order and then repeated.
The average of both efforts was then utilized for further analysis.
The sticking region occurred consistently at a 90 degrees knee angle, however, the maximum force produced varied between 110 degrees and 170 degrees with the greatest frequency at 150 degrees for both men and women.
The percent difference between the maximum and minimum MVIF was 46% for men and 57% for women.
