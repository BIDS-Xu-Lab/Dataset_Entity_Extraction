Cadmium (Cd) is a highly toxic element able to induce acute liver injury in rats after intraperitoneal administration.
The dose-dependent Cd-induced hepatotoxicity was examined in three different rat strains.
A difference in hepatotoxicity was observed in the three rat strains, determined by the examination of serum enzymes' activities and other biochemical parameters, all markedly altered after Cd intoxication.
The histological findings came to confirm the variations of the above-mentioned parameters.
It is concluded that the administration of this toxic agent caused different toxicity in the three rat strains examined, indicating a more intense damage in Wistar than in Quinster and Lewis rats.
