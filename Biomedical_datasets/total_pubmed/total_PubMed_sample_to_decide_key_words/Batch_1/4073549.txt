A scanning electron microscopic (SEM) cast method that has been utilized to examine the internal structure of dentine was modified to examine canalicular communications in the cortices of a human femur and ulna.
Although some preparations in which all of the matrix was removed were examined, etched preparations were found to be the most informative.
Casts of lacunae and canaliculi along with the underlying matrix could be visualized in these preparations.
In the femur, whose cortex exhibited a typical lamellar pattern, canalicular communication was seen between first and second generation osteons and occasionally between osteons and interstitial regions.
The interstitial regions in the ulna appeared to be primarily woven rather than lamellar bone.
Extensive communication between the outermost lacunae of osteons and interstitial regions was observed in the ulna.
