Eighty-four eyes with aging macular degeneration were included in this five-year retrospective study (1989-1994).
Sixty-four eyes were treated with laser, whereas in 20 eyes photocoagulation was not performed because these patients refused laser treatment.
The latter served as a control group.
Out of 64 laser-treated eyes, 48 (75%) eyes had extramacular choroidal, and 15 (25%) juxtafoveal neovascular membrane.
A comparable percentage and alterations were recorded in the control group of eyes.
At the beginning of the study, the mean visual acuity distribution was 0.5 in both the treated and untreated group of eyes, which was not statistically significant (p > 0.16).
Recurrent neovascularization developed in 33 (52%) out of 64 eyes at the end of the first and in the second year after photocoagulation, being the main cause of severe vision impairment.
At the beginning of the second year, the risk of severe vision loss by six or more Snellen's lines was recorded in 14 (41%) out of 33 eyes with the vision of 0.15, and after five years in 22 (73%) out of 33 eyes with the vision of 0.08.
A the end of the study, unchanged or slightly deteriorated visual acuity (0.5-0.4) was found in 27 (42.1%) out of 64 laser-treated eyes, and in only 2 (10%) out of 20 untreated eyes.
At the end of the five-year study, total risk of severe vision loss by six or more Snellen's lines was present in 30 (52.8%) out of 64 laser-treated eyes, and in 15 (74%) out of 20 untreated eyes.
Study results showed laser treatment of neovascular aging macular degeneration to be absolutely useful in decreasing visual acuity reduction as compared to the untreated control group.
