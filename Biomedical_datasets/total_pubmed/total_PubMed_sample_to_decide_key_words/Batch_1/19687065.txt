Electron holography allows the reconstruction of the complete electron wave, and hence offers the possibility of correcting aberrations.
In fact, this was shown by means of the uncorrected CM30 Special TÃ¼bingen transmission electron microscope (TEM), revealing, after numerical aberration correction, a resolution of approximately 0.1 nm, both in amplitude and phase.
However, it turned out that the results suffer from a comparably poor signal-to-noise ratio.
The reason is that the limited coherent electron current, given by gun brightness, has to illuminate a width of at least four times the point-spread function given by the aberrations.
As, using the hardware corrector, the point-spread function shrinks considerably, the current density increases and the signal-to-noise ratio improves correspondingly.
Furthermore, the phase shift at the atomic dimensions found in the image plane also increases because the collection efficiency of the optics increases with resolution.
In total, the signals of atomically fine structures are better defined for quantitative evaluation.
In fact, the results achieved by electron holography in a Tecnai F20 Cs-corr TEM confirm this.
