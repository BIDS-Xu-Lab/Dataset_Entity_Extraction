Manganese-based compounds, especially manganese oxides, are one of the most exceptional electrode materials.
Specifically, manganese oxides have gained significant interest owing to their unique crystal structures, high theoretical capacity, abundant natural availability and eco-friendly nature.
However, as transition metal semiconductors, manganese oxide possess low electrical conductivity, limited rate capacity, and suboptical cycle stability.
Thus, combining manganese oxides with carbon or other metallic materials can significantly improve their electrochemical performance.
These composites increase active sites and conductivity, thereby improving electrode reaction kinetics, cycle stability, and lifespan of supercapacitors (SCs) and batteries.
This paper reviews the latest applications of Mn-based cathodes in SCs and advanced batteries.
Moreover, the energy storage mechanisms were also proposed.
In this review, the development prospects and challenges for advanced energy storage applications of Mn-based cathodes are summarized.
