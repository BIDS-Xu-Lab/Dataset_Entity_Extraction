Infection by the canine heartworm, Dirofilaria immitis, causes significant cardiopulmonary disease, with progression impacted by increasing parasite numbers and duration of infection.
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is an important mediator of cardiac and pulmonary disease.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mitigates the maladaptive effects of angiotensin II by converting it to angiotensin (1-7).
We hypothesized that circulating ACE2 activity would be altered in dogs with high heartworm infection intensities relative to dogs without heartworms.
Frozen serum samples (-80 °C) from 30 dogs euthanized at Florida shelters were analyzed for ACE2 activity using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectroscopy and a kinetics approach with and without an ACE2 inhibitor.
A convenience sample of 15 dogs without heartworms (HW0) and 15 dogs with > 50 heartworms (HW>50) was included.
Heartworm number and microfilariae presence were determined at necropsy.
The effects of heartworm status, body weight, and sex on ACE2 were evaluated using regression analysis.
Values of P < 0.05 were considered significant.
All HW0 dogs were D. immitis microfilariae-negative and all HW>50 dogs were D. immitis microfilariae-positive with a median adult worm count of 74 (minimum = 63, maximum = 137).
The ACE2 activity of HW>50 dogs (median = 28.2 ng/ml; minimum = 13.6, maximum = 76.2) was not different from HW0 dogs (median 31.9 ng/ml; minimum = 14.1, maximum = 139.1; P = 0.53).
The ACE2 activity was higher in dogs with high body weight (median 34.2 ng/ml minimum = 14.1, maximum = 76.2) than in dogs with low weight (median 27.5 ng/ml; minimum = 16.4, maximum = 139.1; P = .044).
Heartworm infection did not impact ACE2 activity in shelter dogs with or without heartworms, but heavier dogs had higher ACE2 activity compared to lighter dogs.
Comprehensive RAAS evaluation and additional clinical information would aid in understanding how ACE2 activity relates to the entire cascade and clinical status in dogs with heartworm disease.
