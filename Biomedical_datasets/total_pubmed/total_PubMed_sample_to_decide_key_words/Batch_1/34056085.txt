Phosphorus-based organocatalysis encompasses several subfields that have undergone rapid growth in recent years.
This Outlook gives an overview of its various aspects.
In particular, we highlight key advances in three topics: nucleophilic phosphine catalysis, organophosphorus catalysis to bypass phosphine oxide waste, and organophosphorus compound-mediated single electron transfer processes.
We briefly summarize five additional topics: chiral phosphoric acid catalysis, phosphine oxide Lewis base catalysis, iminophosphorane super base catalysis, phosphonium salt phase transfer catalysis, and frustrated Lewis pair catalysis.
Although it is not catalytic in nature, we also discuss novel discoveries that are emerging in phosphorus(V) ligand coupling.
We conclude with some ideas about the future of organophosphorus catalysis.
