This case report details a rare instance of rapid iris metastasis from esophageal cancer in a 59-year-old man.
A literature review was conducted to explore recent advances in detecting, diagnosing, and treating intraocular metastatic malignancies.
Positron emission tomography-computed tomography played a crucial role in identifying primary sites and systemic metastases.
Local treatment combined with systemic therapy effectively reduced tumor size, preserved useful vision, and improved the patient's survival rate.
A comparison was made of the characteristics of iris metastases from esophageal cancer and lung cancer, including age, gender, tumor characteristics, and treatment.
The challenges associated with diagnosis and treatment are discussed, highlighting the implications for clinical practice.
