Prolonged labor is one of the most important risk factors for perinatal compromise and, if caused by obstructed labor, it carries the risk of uterine rupture, postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), puerperal sepsis, and maternal death.
To determine whether or not hyoscine butylbromide shortens the stages of labor, without an increase in maternal or neonatal complications.
In single-blinded randomized clinical trial study, 188 multiparas women in active phase of labor who were admitted to Shahid Sadoughi Hospital from October 2006 to April 2007 in Yazd - Iran, were evaluated.
They were divided hyoscine group (n = 94) received 20mg (1ml) of hyoscine and control group (n = 94) received 1 ml of normal saline was given as placebo, intravenously.
The effects of hyoscine in shortening labor time; and neonatal Apgar score was compared.
Duration of the first (mean± SD: 186.8 ± 125.6 minutes vs. 260.4 ± 120.9 minutes, p= 0.00 1) and second stage of labor (mean± SD: 20.0 ± 8.1minutes vs. 25.8 ± 9.4 minutes, p= 0.03) was shorter in hyoscine group.
Frequency of cesarean section and mean of neonatal Apgar score at minutes of one and 5 were not different in both groups.
No serious adverse events were seen in the two groups.
Injection of hyoscine in active phase of labor can be effective in shortening of labor without any adverse effect on mother and fetus.
